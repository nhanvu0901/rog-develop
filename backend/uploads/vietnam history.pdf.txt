A History of the Vietnamese
The history of Vietnam prior to the nineteenth century is rarely examined in
any detail. In this groundbreaking work, K. W. Taylor takes up this challenge,
addressing a wide array of topics from the earliest times to the present day–
including language, literature, religion, and warfare– and themes– including
Sino-Vietnamese relations, the interactions of the peoples of different regions
within the country, and the various forms of government adopted by the
Vietnamese throughout their history.A History of the Vietnameseis based on
primary source materials, combining a comprehensive narrative with an analysis
which endeavors to see the Vietnamese past through the eyes of those who
lived it. Taylor questions long-standing stereotypes and clichés about Vietnam,
drawing attention to sharp discontinuities in the Vietnamese past. Fluently
written and accessible to all readers, this highly original contribution to the
study of Southeast Asia is a landmark text for all students and scholars
of Vietnam.
k. w. tayloris a professor in the Department of Asian Studies at Cornell
University. His career began in the US army, where he was deployed in the
US–Vietnam War. He has now been researching Vietnam for nearly forty years,
and his work has made a fundamental contribution to the development of
the field.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I wish to acknowledge my gratitude to four people who have provided inspir-
ation for this book. The late Paul G. Fried (1919–2006), whom I encountered at
Hope College nearly half a century ago, gave me confidence in the importance of
studying the past and in the possibility of becoming a historian; without his
encouragement, I doubt if I would have subdued the disquiets of wartime experi-
ence to commence a life of scholarship. John K. Whitmore, who initiated me into
the study of Vietnamese history at the University of Michigan, demonstrated a
commitment to academic study, an intellectual integrity, and an abiding curiosity
about the past that have given me a deep appreciation for the craft of the
historian. The late Oliver W. Wolters (1915–2000) taught me how to critique
my ideas about historical study; his questing mind was a constant prompt to
reread and to rethink texts with an awareness of the options exercised by those
who wrote them. The late Alton L. (Pete) Becker (1932–2011), both during my
training at the University of Michigan and during a summer seminary in1992,
taught me a love of words, of how language shapes and is shaped by thought,
and of the pleasure of translation; his influence has gone deep into how
I understand culture as a process of telling stories and of translating them. Olga
Dror, my wife, has been my intellectual companion and most valued discussant
for ideas about the Vietnamese past.

INTRODUCTION
Prologue
When people first began to live on Earth, terrain was very different from what it
is today. For tens of thousands of years, what we know as the country of
Vietnam was the mountainous western edge of a broad plain. Now covered by
the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea, this plain extended in places for
hundreds of kilometers east of the modern coastline and included a massif that
we now call Hainan Island. Today we can imagine that beneath the mud at the
bottom of the sea lie the relics of the people who inhabited this plain. But our
knowledge of their existence comes only from the remains of quarries and
workshops where they crafted stone tools at the tops of mountains along the
modern Vietnamese coast. During that time, people also inhabited the mountains
in what is now northern Vietnam, and we know of them from what they left in
the caves where they lived.
About twelve to eight thousand years ago, the coastline shifted westward as
sea levels rose with the melting of the ice-age glaciers. The water reached to
around5.8 meters above the modern level of the sea and penetrated into the
mountain valleys. Thereafter, the sea gradually receded to its present level,
exposing a chain of coastal plains that became the lowlands of what is now
Vietnam. The most important of these plains for early Vietnamese history is the
most northern of them. This is the plain of the Red River. It was formed by grey
oceanic sediment emerging from the receding sea that has been increasingly
streaked by accumulations of the red silt that has given the Red River its name.
The Red River flows in nearly a straight line from the Yunnan plateau to the
sea. It follows what geologists call the Red River Fault Zone. This is a major
geological discontinuity where for millions of years the land south of the fault has
been shearing a few millimeters each year southeastward under tectonic pressure
from the Indian subcontinent against the Eurasian land mass. The plain of the

Red River, along with the smaller plains of the Ma and Ca Rivers immediately to
the south, make up the scene in which Vietnamese history was lived until the
fifteenth century.
Between four and five thousand years ago, people with stone tools began to
live on these plains in agricultural communities with rice, domesticated animals,
and pottery. It is fruitless to speculate about the origins of these people. They
lived so long ago and left such meager evidence of their existence that they are
impervious to our strategies for using archaeological, geological, geographical,
or linguistic evidence to identify them as having arrived from a particular
somewhere. They may have come from the continental land mass, they may
have come from the lands submerged beneath the sea, or, most likely of all, they
may have come from a mixture of peoples from both directions.
During the succeeding millennium, people with bronze weapons gained
supremacy over these communities. At that time, advanced bronze cultures
existed in several areas of the Asian continent. There is no surviving evidence
that would allow us to specify from where the bronze-age people came to assert
their rule over the Red River plain, or even to determine that they came from
elsewhere and did not arise from the existing society as a result of bronze
technology being introduced through peaceful exchange. Thereafter, contact
with expanding political powers in the north, which we now associate with
ancient China, increasingly exposed the people living here to northern influence
and power and led to incorporation into the Chinese imperial realm.
The Dong Son Culture with its distinctive bronze drums decorated with boats,
warriors, musicians, dancers, feathered garments, birds, animals, reptiles, and
amphibians flourished during the four or five centuries preceding conquest by the
Han Chinese in the mid first centuryce, after which this culture disappeared.
During the next nine centuries, the people here lived under a local form of
imperial administration as the southernmost members of a succession of Chinese
empires. During the past thousand years, local dynasties ruled as vassals of
Chinese empires, save for the last century and a half during which a brief French
hegemony gave shape to modern Vietnam.
Vantage
Vietnamese scholars have endeavored to project a sense of national identity back
into the past as far as possible. In the modern period, it became common for
Vietnamese to affirm a national history going back four thousand years to when
archaeologists date artifacts that they have assembled and categorized under the
name of Phung Nguyen Culture. Phung Nguyen is defined as a late stone and

early bronze culture that represents a level of archaeological uniformity in the
Red River Plain that did not previously exist. Many Vietnamese scholars are
inclined to draw a line of continuity in cultural, and even ethno-linguistic,
development from Phung Nguyen to modern Vietnam. This inclination, how-
ever, makes an exuberant use of evidence.
The search for origins in the distant past is a common intellectual endeavor
among peoples in nearly all times and places. For example, historians at royal
courts in northern Vietnam during the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries were
concerned to affirm their status in reference to rampant northern empires, the
Yuan and the Ming. They did this not only by culling references from classical
Chinese texts about what they imagined to have been their ancestors in antiquity
but also by constructing a“southern” history for themselves that is largely parallel
with and a response to“northern” imperial history. The urge for connections with
the past is a means of self-affirmation, not a scholarly endeavor.
What we can know about the past with some degree of confidence is a meager
residue of what remains from an ongoing process of accumulation and attrition,
of gain and loss, of putting together and tossing away, a process in which all
generations participate. Human efforts to remain oriented amidst change can
take forms between the extremes of denying change and of seeking change.
Historians are not immune to the implications of such efforts, and they do not
agree on the appropriate pose to assume toward change in wielding the rhetoric
of their craft. I believe that the task of historical scholarship is to look at what
survives from the past as coming from people with their own existence, not as
evidence of people who attain significance primarily as precursors of people
today. The Vietnamese past does not display an internal logic of development
leading to the present. Rather, it reveals a series of experiments designed by
successive generations as solutions to perennial problems of social and political
organization. These experiments have failed, have reached an impasse, or have
been overcome by the possibilities or the violence of larger contexts. None has
been a final solution.
Vietnamese history is a convenient name for what can be known about a
certain aspect of the past. What makes it Vietnamese is that the events of which it
is comprised took place in what we now call the country of Vietnam and that
certain versions of it have been taught as a common memory to generations of
people who speak the Vietnamese language, thereby inducing a sense of owner-
ship. I find interest in the Vietnamese past not because it is Vietnamese but
because it is about how human society has been organized and governed during
many centuries on the edge of an empire.
Vietnamese history as we know it today could not exist without Chinese
history. The manner in which Vietnamese history overlaps with and is

distinguished from Chinese history presents a singular example of experience in
organizing and governing human society within the orbit of Sinic civilization that
can be compared with Korean history and Japanese history. Such a comparison
is not the purpose of this book. The purpose of this book is to present a narrative
of current scholarship on Vietnamese history that is accessible to students and
general readers. But, this book is also written with an awareness of comparative
possibilities within the academic jurisdiction of East Asia.
Vietnamese history can also be viewed in a Southeast Asian comparative
context. The kingdom of Dai Viet that existed in Vietnam from the eleventh to
the fourteenth centuries was contemporary with other major kingdoms in main-
land Southeast Asia at Angkor (Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand) and at Pagan
(Burma). Also, the southward expansion of the Burmese and Siamese peoples
from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries is seemingly parallel with a
similar movement of Vietnamese peoples at the same time. However, the dispar-
ity in surviving evidence, the great differences in culture and politics, and the
exceptional imperatives of the Sino-Vietnamese relationship are obstacles to
meaningful comparisons.
Language
A large proportion of the modern Vietnamese vocabulary derives from Chinese,
but linguists categorize the Vietnamese language as a member of the Mon-Khmer
family of languages. Although available comparative data for studying Vietnam-
ese with other Mon-Khmer languages are limited, there is an abundance of
materials documenting the historical relationship between Chinese and Vietnam-
ese. Linguists continue to develop new methods for analyzing such data, and
developments in Sino-Vietnamese historical linguistics enable new ways of theo-
rizing how the Vietnamese language came to be. Building upon the work of
scholarship in French and Chinese in the early twentieth century and of Japanese
scholarship more recently, linguists are beginning to appreciate the great com-
plexity of the relationship between speakers of the Chinese and the Vietnamese
languages; both the speakers and the languages are products of great changes
during the past two millennia from which documentation of this relationship
exists.
Sino-Vietnamese historical linguistics has tended to focus attention upon
words from the classrooms in which what we call Literary Chinese was taught
for more than two millennia. This was the language of education, scholarship,
literature, and government in both China and Vietnam until the turn of the
twentieth century. While Literary Chinese in its written form has changed

relatively little through the centuries, the phonologies of Literary Chinese have
changed significantly in accordance with changes in spoken languages. Advances
in phonological analysis enable greater understandings of the realms of spoken
languages that have interacted with Literary Chinese. Literary Chinese, as the
written form of the prestige language, was an aspect of a larger world of
language contact between speakers of languages that we now identify as con-
tributors to modern Chinese and Vietnamese. Modes of speaking Literary Chi-
nese can be thought of as literary registers that became aspects of prestige
versions of vernacular forms of language.
For over a millennium, up until the tenth century, speakers of Han-Tang
Chinese accumulated in what is now northern Vietnam. Imperial government
was based in the area of modern Hanoi where the most critical mass of Chinese
speakers concentrated. During the thirty to forty generations of this time, the
Chinese speakers developed their own regional version of Chinese, for which one
modern linguist, John Duong Phan, has found evidence and that for convenience
can be called Annamese Middle Chinese. It is possible that this was simply a
dialect of a broader Southern or Southwestern Middle Chinese of that time.
The non-Chinese-speaking lowland population spoke a language that linguists
call Proto-Viet-Muong, the most eastern member of the Mon-Khmer languages
that at that time prevailed in the plains drained by the Mekong and the Menam.
Proto-Viet-Muong can be imagined as having spread north at some earlier time
from the passes linking the Mekong and Ca River valleys. During the ten
centuries of imperial rule, many Chinese words were borrowed into spoken
Proto-Viet-Muong and we can reasonably conjecture that there was a signifi-
cantly high level of bilingualism among primary speakers of both languages.
Beginning in the tenth and eleventh centuries, when the governing connection
with Chinese dynasties was broken, there were no longer regular infusions of
Chinese speakers from the north and local kings appeared. The population of
Annamese Middle Chinese speakers was increasingly concentrated in the Red
River plain where political authority was based. As the diglossic situation col-
lapsed, speakers of Annamese Middle Chinese gradually shifted into Proto-Viet-
Muong, bringing with them a critical mass of vocabulary and grammatical
particles, thus giving rise to the Vietnamese language as we categorize it today,
the speakers of which at that time were called Kinh, meaning the people of the
“capital” in the region of Hanoi. On the other hand, the speakers of various
forms of Proto-Viet-Muong who did not participate in this“shift,” namely those
in the plains of the Ma and Ca Rivers, were eventually driven from the lowlands
by the Kinh speakers, who referred to them as Trai, or“outpost” people; in the
twentieth century, French ethnographers and colonial administrators identified
the descendents of these people as Muong. The Kinh–Trai distinction is first

mentioned in historical records from the mid thirteenth century, although it
surely existed prior to that time; this is also the time when the writing of
Vietnamese poetry is first documented and when the last generation of Vietnam-
ese princes who spoke Chinese are known to have lived.
In the fifteenth century, two decades of Ming Chinese rule introduced new
pronunciations for words already existing in Vietnamese from the Han-Tang/
Annamese Middle Chinese experience. Some later Vietnamese scholars viewed the
Ming pronunciations as less correct than the older forms. This is an exampleof a
common phenomenon during the long history of Sino-Vietnamese interaction:
Chinese words once absorbed by Vietnamese would be“re-borrowed” from a later
version of the Chinese language with new pronunciations and sometimes modified
semantic fields. The rejection of Ming pronunciations was part of a general reaction
among educated Vietnamese to the memory of Ming rule. Nevertheless, from the
fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, during which Vietnamese began to flourish as a
literary language, writers adopted or invented many classroom-inspired Chinese
words to bejewel and elevate the vernacular in a process of“relexification.”
A further complication is that, beginning in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Vietnamese speakers in what is now central and southern Vietnam
began to develop regional versions of the language as a result both of normal
language change and of contact with non-Vietnamese speakers. In central Viet-
nam, many Cham speakers began to speak Vietnamese, and, in the late seven-
teenth century, a large wave of Ming Chinese refugees into the south also had a
linguistic impact.
This new understanding of the Vietnamese language as arising from a long
history of Sinic bilingualism gives formative significance to the centuries of Chi-
nese rule that is more plausible than the well-established cliché of“a thousand
years of Chinese domination” that imagines an already existing Vietnamese
identity surviving many generations of participation in Sinic civilization while
being fundamentally uninfluenced by it. It also requires a major shift in our view of
Vietnamese history and culture away from the scheme of an ancient and enduring
Vietnamese identity claimed by modern nationalists. Vietnamese culture and
language came into existence as the result of a merging of what linguistic evidence
reveals as speakers of Annamese Middle Chinese and Proto-Viet-Muong.

surviving from pre-modern times is often very sparse, which is likely to disap-
point the thirst of some readers for more knowledge than is available. I have
sought to avoid excessive speculation or large generalizations that lack plausible
evidence. At the same time I have endeavored to rise above a tedious account of
random events by charting a narrative to stimulate the imagination, making
thought about the past possible. I have excluded a mass of detail and have
aspired toward coherence sufficient to satisfy both those who prefer to think
diachronically across time and those who prefer to think synchronically with
topics. An introductory survey, this book provides a point of entry into Vietnam-
ese history and does not excavate the historiography from which my ideas have
emerged. It aspires to provide a sketch of the Vietnamese past using political,
administrative, economic, and cultural information.
I have given much attention to simply sorting out a basic sequence of events
because this has never yet been done with the detail and method enabled by
surviving evidence and recent scholarship. Although many detailed studies exist
in Vietnamese, and to some extent in Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and French,
English-language writings have for the most part referred to the pre-modern past
with vast clichés and to modern times with relatively narrowly focused narratives
that follow lines of argument about interpretive themes fundamentally unrelated
to the Vietnamese. I have endeavored to provide as much opportunity as possible
for readers to enter the past and to see events from the perspective of those who
lived them or who recorded them. If we imagine the past with the dynamism of
possibility with which it was lived, we can glimpse it looking back at us with the
eyes of aspiration that each human life and each generation have aimed at the
future.
The Vietnamese past is full of personalities and events both obscure and
famous, and often the obscure have had greater effect upon the direction of
culture, society, and politics than have the famous. I have tried to move beyond
the propaganda of memory and memorializing to display a thicker layer of
information that has accumulated about people and events. My purpose in doing
so is to evoke a sense of the past as alive in its own time.
Because much of what survives from the past concerns the vicissitudes of
political authority, some readers may view this as a “kings and battles ”
approach, which I believe would be a superficial impression, for I have
endeavored to give serious attention to geographical contexts, language, litera-
ture, education, ideology, religion, ethnic and social formations, institutional
developments, agrarian policies, trade, and commerce. Nevertheless, I have
striven to sort out the political and military events because in the English
language there has not yet been a sustained engagement with the history of
Vietnamese efforts to structure authority and negotiate change.

Some readers will be disappointed by the lack of footnotes. The decision to
avoid marking the text with notes was made out of consideration for the
intended audience and from an expectation that readers looking for documenta-
tion can consult the bibliographic essays. I have done my best to stay close to the
sources. There were times when I was tempted by an interesting thought toward
an interpretation that in the end had to be discarded because the evidence was
insufficient to bear its weight. I have indicated places where the evidence is too
problematic to sustain any definite assertion. I am sure to have made errors and
can do no more than to trust that other scholars will find them.
In this book, I have taken a pragmatic approach to the great morass of toponyms
that have accumulated from past to present. The maps are provided as references for
reading the book and do not indicate names and jurisdictions in their historical
specificity. Places in the book have been known by various names during the two
thousand years covered by historical records, and these names often covered differ-
ent or overlapping territories at different times. Consequently, I have used a mix of
historical and modern names, noting when I am using a modern name anachronis-
tically for the sake of clarity. As much as possible, my aim has been to facilitatea
narrative without digressions into the complexities and conundrums of historical
geography, which require a separate study.
For example, the name Hanoi does not date before the nineteenth century.
During the past millennium and a half, this place has been an administrative and
dynastic center known by several names, the most prominent being Dai La,
Thang Long, Dong Kinh, and Ke Cho. I have used these names in their historical
contexts while at times also using Hanoi when doing so solved rhetorical prob-
lems, enhanced clarity, and seemed unobjectionable. In general, I have used
modern names when historical names would introduce contextual inaccuracies
and excessive explanatory asides.
The maps do not indicate jurisdictional boundaries for provinces and districts
because that would introduce two unnecessary problems. First of all, the maps
do not show every toponym but only those that come into the narrative; since we
cannot begin to draw some boundaries without ending up by drawing all of
them, we would need additional names that would clutter the maps with infor-
mation of no use for the narrative. Also, since boundaries change and can be
known but approximately, the project of sorting them out for each historical era,
along with all the complexities and conundrums arising when doing that, is a
task for a different, more specialized, kind of book.
I have endeavored to provide enough dates to maintain a sense of diachronic
orientation but without cluttering the narrative with unnecessary information.
The tables contain reign dates for rulers, but these are not unproblematic,
particularly when times of transition occur near the end or the beginning of

years as counted according to different calendars and historiographical rules.
Vietnamese texts follow the lunar calendar in which the twelfth lunar month
overlaps with the first solar month of the calendar currently in general usage.
Furthermore, Vietnamese historians assigned whole years to rulers so that the
remainder of a year in which a ruler died was counted in the reign of the deceased
ruler and the successor’s reign was considered to officially start only at the
beginning of the next year. In some cases, sources provide different dates for
the death of a ruler and the accession of the successor, or rulers were deposed so
their death dates and the end of their reigns do not coincide, or the reigns of rival
or coterminous rulers overlap, or there may be a gap between one ruler and
another during times of dynastic turmoil or change. As a consequence of these
considerations, readers will find a variety of dates in different books. Rather than
drawing attention to these problems and analyzing them, I have followed a
policy that privileges the solar calendar without the strictness and precision that
a detailed study of dating problems deserves, seeking instead to provide dates
that maximize the integrity and the readability of the narrative while remaining
essentially faithful to a careful study of surviving sources.
Summary
The thirteen chapters of this book are organized on the basis of length and
convenience and do not represent any scheme of periodization with which to
conceptualize Vietnamese history. In terms of large themes, I am inclined to
organize this material into four periods: first, the centuries during which what
is now northern Vietnam was a province of Chinese empires (Chapter1); second,
the four centuries of the Ly and Tran dynasties during which Buddhist aristocra-
cies in the Red River plain ruled (Chapters2 and 3); third, the four centuries
attributed to the Le dynasty during which kings came from Thanh Hoa Province,
Confucianism was the ideology of rulers, the Vietnamese expanded into the
south, and there were long eras of separate realms at war (Chapters4, 5, 6, 7,
and 8); finally, the two most recent centuries during which the modern country of
Vietnam came into being (Chapters9, 10, 11, 12, and13).
During the millennium when what is now northern Vietnam was a frontier
province of Chinese imperial dynasties, the people living there were acculturated
to what we call East Asian civilization. In art, music, architecture, dress, cuisine,
education, language, literature, religion, philosophy, social organization, and
political behavior, nearly all the distinguishing features of Vietnamese culture
were acquired at this time as a consequence of contact with the Han-Tang
civilization of China.

A thousand years is a relatively long time in human history and it is hard to
overemphasize the changes that occurred during this age of belonging to north-
ern empires. The people who lived in the Red River plain before this time and
those who lived there after this time would surely be unrecognizable and unin-
telligible to each other. Important changes can be attributed to any people during
such a period of time, but the effect of being governed by a succession of imperial
dynasties surely accelerated the pace of change in particular directions that
reflected the course of imperial history. During these centuries, local culture,
society, and political organization passed through many vicissitudes, some of
them utterly transforming. Crafts, erudition, and political thought were mostly
focused upon mastering the elements of imperial civilization. At the same time,
from generation to generation and from dynasty to dynasty, a population of
“northerners” accumulated and became a critical mass of people that were the
governing class and its most reliable followers. Furthermore, there were a great
variety of interactions, overlaps, and adaptions between local and imperial
societies. It is not surprising that, intellectually, Vietnamese history later came
to be written as a discussion, even an argument, with imperial Chinese history,
for Vietnamese history can be understood only in reference to Chinese dynastic
history. Accordingly, the earliest large event in Vietnamese history has to do with
the arrival of northern imperial power near the end of the third centurybce and
the eventual absorption of the region into the realm of northern dynasties. This
situation was not altered until the tenth century after basic changes in imperial
society and politics made it impossible for Chinese dynasties to continue to rule
this region, thereby bringing the provincial relationship with northern powers to
an end.
During the period from the late tenth to the early thirteenth centuries, political
leadership shifted from the individual charisma of kings to leadership by men
related to the mothers of kings. The Ly royal family came from the upper plains
northeast of Hanoi.
Two brief wars with the Northern Song dynasty confirmed a relationship of
formal vassalage with autonomy. The culture at royal courts combined popular
spirit cults with the moral teachings of Buddhist monks, the occult skills of
Daoist priests, and the erudition of Confucian scholars. The dynastic scheme of
authority that was established at this time unraveled in synchrony with the
decline of imperial power in the north. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
the Tran dynasty, based on the coast downriver from Hanoi, endeavored to
eliminate the power of maternal families by ensuring that queen mothers were
always from the royal family itself. In place of individual charisma, a group
charisma was nurtured among the many talented princes of the royal family, who
gained fame by leading soldiers against Mongol invaders in the thirteenth

century. In the fourteenth century, as the royal family lost interest in governing
the country, kings nurtured a new class of educated commoners to provide talent
for their courts. In the late fourteenth century, the dynasty failed to respond to
new military, political, and ideological pressures from the rising Ming dynasty in
the north and an echoing resurgence of Cham power in the south. The prevailing
syncretistic attitude toward the“three religions” of Buddhism, Confucianism,
and Daoism faded amidst dynastic collapse as the ascendant Ming dynasty
trumpeted a new affirmation of Confucianism in China.
Beginning in the late fourteenth century, there were four successive experi-
ments in government that responded to the rise of a new power base in Thanh
Hoa Province, located immediately south of the Red River basin in the plains of
the Ma and Chu Rivers. This opened a new age in Vietnamese history that would
for the next four centuries be marked by regional conflict as Vietnamese migrated
into the southern coastlands and began to challenge the ascendant position of the
Red River plain. At the turn of the fifteenth century, a leader from Thanh Hoa
assembled an entourage to pursue a series of experiments in educational, fiscal,
agrarian, social, and political reform. Resistance to him in the Red River plain
assisted the Ming conquest in the first decade of the fifteenth century. The Ming
then experimented for two decades with efforts to turn the region into an
imperial province. They built schools and propagated a curriculum that pro-
moted Confucian forms of social and political organization. Although the Ming
assembled a large local following drawn from erudite families in the Red River
plain, resistance to them formed in Thanh Hoa. When the Ming eventually
abandoned their policy in Vietnam, a coalition of Thanh Hoa clans proclaimed
a new dynasty.
There was an era of relative peace, prosperity, and power in the late fifteenth
century during the reign of a king who combined personal charisma with a court
aspiring toward the forms of bureaucracy practiced in Ming China. During his
rule, Confucian values were propagated as never before; new laws governing
education, administration, land tenure, taxation, conscription, and public mor-
ality were promulgated; the writing of vernacular as well as classical poetry
flourished; soldiers were sent to conquer lands along the southern coast and over
the mountains as far as the Mekong River. However, in the early sixteenth
century, royal authority collapsed and was superseded by a struggle for power
between leaders from Thanh Hoa and a new dynasty in the Red River plain that
survived for seven decades before being pushed aside by armies from the south-
ern provinces.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a new Vietnamese perspective
emerged on the southern frontier. This perspective was produced by close contact
with other peoples such as Chams, Khmers, Malays, Siamese, Japanese, Chinese,

and Europeans and by a sense of options and possibilities that drew Vietnamese
speakers away from the relative sense of discipline and confinement that pre-
vailed in the provinces around Hanoi. Northerners and southerners tested each
other on battlefields for fifty years in the seventeenth century; an uneasy truce
then lasted for a hundred years before another era of warfare erupted in the late
eighteenth century. By the mid eighteenth century, the southern kingdom had
pushed its southwestern border to the extent of the current Khmer–Viet bound-
ary. European merchants and missionaries arrived during this time and found
two rival Vietnamese kingdoms that they called Tonkin and Cochinchina. The
military and political deadlock was eventually broken at the beginning of the
nineteenth century when a new dynasty established its capital at Hue, in central
Vietnam, uniting for the first time all Vietnamese speakers in the territories that
now make up the country of Vietnam.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Vietnamese encountered the
global forces that drove the emergence of what is commonly called the modern
world, giving rise to various visions of social and political organization. In the
early nineteenth century, the dynastic regime looked to China for culture and
ideas about government. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a
French colonial regime subordinated Vietnamese life and thought to a European-
based imperial system that for the first time cut the Vietnamese off from their
historic relationship with China. When the French era came to an end in the mid
twentieth century, northern and southern governments fought for twenty years
over competing visions of a future Vietnam. The government in the north was
allied with the communist world, being communal and disciplined. The govern-
ment in the south was allied with the capitalist world, being relatively more
individualistic and free. The northern regime conquered the south and then was
at war with its neighbors and in relative international isolation for another fifteen
years. At the end of the twentieth century, with the end of the Cold War
confrontation, the Vietnamese state began a process of integration into the global
system of economic and political relationships that presently exists. One of the
most enduring features of Vietnamese history is that the rulers of China and
Vietnam have maintained a common worldview amidst all the experiments
undertaken through the centuries.
Pronunciation and spelling of Vietnamese names
This book does not include Vietnamese diacritical marks, which are an integral
part of the Vietnamese alphabet. Some diacritics indicate tones and some indicate
particular vowel or consonant sounds. Jesuit missionaries invented the

Vietnamese alphabet in the seventeenth century, largely in reference to Portu-
guese phonology. Consequently, readers who do not know Vietnamese but are
familiar with European languages will not go far wrong in sounding out most
pronunciations in Vietnamese. However, readers may be interested to know
how to pronounce certain common names in Vietnamese history that have
unexpected sounds. For example, Ly is pronounced“lee”; Le is pronounced
“lay”; Tran rhymes with “bun”; Mac is pronounced “mock”; Hue is pro-
nounced “way.”
One consonant sound that may pose particular challenges to non-Vietnamese
readers is the initial“ng” sound in Ngo and Nguyen, which is a nasalized“guh”
made in the back of the throat, somewhat similar to the“ng” sound in“bingo”
(which rhymes with Ngo). For Nguyen, this sound is combined with“we” and
“in” to produce “ng-we-in,” spoken as one syllable. When“ng” is combined
with an“h” as in the name of the tenth-century ruler Duong Dinh Nghe, a“y”
sound is added to the consonant cluster, producing a sound something like
“Ngyay.”
Without diacritics, the distinction between two consonants formed from the
letter “d” is lost. The “hard d,” indicated by a horizontal dash through the
vertical line in either the upper (D) or lower (d) case letters, is pronounced as if in
a European language. The“soft d” is indicated by the absence of that horizontal
dash; northern Vietnamese pronounce it like a“z” and southern Vietnamese
pronounce it like a“y.” For example, Duong Dinh Nghe contains both a soft and
a hard “D” and is pronounced “Zoong Dinh Ngyay” by northerners and
“Yoong Dinh Ngyay” by southerners. Another example is the name of the
president of the first Republic of Vietnam (Ngo Dinh Diem,1955–1963), which
also contains both kinds of “d,” being pronounced “Ngo Dinh Ziem” by
northerners and“Ngo Dinh Yiem” by southerners. On the other hand, the name
of the tenth-century king Dinh Bo Linh is pronounced about the way it looks in
English by both northerners and southerners.
One orthographic convention that I observe is that I spell Hanoi, Saigon,
Cholon, Dalat, and Vietnam rather than Ha Noi, Sai Gon, Cho Lon, Da Lat,
and Viet Nam, which is how these are rendered in the Vietnamese language. My
reason for doing so, while leaving other Vietnamese place names in their Viet-
namese forms, is that these names have been absorbed into common English
usage without the space between syllables and without the capitalization of the
second syllable.

1 THE PROVINCIAL ERA
The empire comes south
After conquering the Yangtze River basin and proclaiming the Qin Empire in
221 bce, Qin Shi Huang,“The First Emperor of China,” sent thousands of his
soldiers over the mountains into the valleys and coastlands of what is now South
China. He also sent convicts and women to establish a population of northerners
there. After years of hard fighting against local people, Qin commanders built a
city on the site of modern Guangzhou (Canton), the main seaport for trade into
the southern seas. When the Qin Empire collapsed after Qin Shi Huang’s death in
the year210 bce, this coastal outpost became the center of a regional kingdom
ruled by the senior commanding officer, Zhao To.
As armies fought for control of the empire in the north, Zhao To proclaimed
himself King of Nan Yue (Southern Yue). Zhao To is among the first historical
figures with a role in Vietnamese history. Sometime during the first quarter of
the second centurybce, he extended his authority over the people living in the
Red River plain of northern Vietnam. Yue had been the name of a state on the
south-central coast of China (the modern province of Zhejiang) during the sixth
to fourth centuriesbce. It was appropriated by Zhao To and eventually applied
to the Red River plain by ancient Chinese dynasties; in Vietnamese, it is
pronounced Viet.
Zhao To was not the first conqueror to arrive in the Red River plain from the
north. Armed adventurers, apparently fleeing the Qin invasion of southern
China, had previously arrived and defeated the local ruler. Their leader pro-
claimed himself King An Duong (Pacifier of the South; An Yang in Chinese). He
occupied and rebuilt an existing fortress now called Co Loa. The earliest stories
about this can be found in books compiled six or seven hundred years later. They
tell about King An Duong and Zhao To struggling for control of the Red River
plain. Several versions of this story have been recorded through the centuries; it is
a tragic romance involving the transfer of political power.

The main line of the story is as follows. During a truce in the fighting between
Zhao To and King An Duong, Zhao To’s son, Shi Jiang, visited King An Duong’s
court. There, he and King An Duong’s daughter, My Chau, fell in love and were
married. The young bride and groom resided at An Duong’s court until Shi Jiang
managed to lay his hands upon the magic crossbow that was the source of King
An Duong’s power. He destroyed the crossbow and fled back to his father, who
thereupon attacked and vanquished King An Duong. King An Duong escaped to
the sea with My Chau in tow. She surreptitiously marked their way so as to be
found by her husband. Perceiving this, King An Duong slew her for her treach-
ery, and then disappeared into the sea. Finding his wife’s body, Shi Jiang leaped
into a well to join her in death.
This story exists today because it was interesting to compilers at Chinese
dynastic courts in the third and fourth centuriesce, and maybe it was even
created by them. At least three aspects of the story would have been popular at
that time and place. One aspect is the theme of romantic love leading to tragic
death, which was in literary fashion then. Another aspect is that it provides an
explanation for how this remote part of the world was brought into the imperial
political system; Zhao To’s kingdom of Nan Yue (Vietnamese Nam Viet), which
eventually expanded to include northern Vietnam, finally became part of the
Han Empire, and all subsequent dynasties considered themselves to be heritors of
Han.
Another reason why this story was interesting to people in the empire is the
dissonance between a matrilocal society in which a man becomes a member of
his wife’s family, for which we have evidence from ancient Vietnam, and a
patrilocal society in which a woman becomes a member of her husband’s family,
which for several centuries had already been the rule among educated people in
China. Ngo Si Lien, a fifteenth-century Vietnamese historian, even commented
upon how strange and“wrong” it was that in this story Shi Jiang lived with his
wife’s family and that My Chau did not go to live with her husband’s family. It
was hard for him to think that there had been a time when people in this country
did not know the patriarchal Confucian family system.
In fact, the people whom King An Duong and Zhao To encountered in the Red
River plain were very strange to educated northerners at that time. Two hundred
years after the time of King An Duong, around the year zero, Han imperial
administrators recorded their efforts to promote agriculture, to open schools,
and to introduce the institution of marriage among the inhabitants of northern
Vietnam. They wanted to expand agriculture to maximize the taxable surplus;
schools were a way to win the minds of intelligent young locals; marriage
practices governed the social system and consequently the form of political
authority that could be exercised. Yet, according to theSan Guo Zhi(Annals

of the Three Kingdoms), an imperial administrator named Xue Zong, who two
centuries later spent most of his career in northern Vietnam, wrote:“According
to the records, civilizing activities have been going on for over four hundred
years, but, according to what I myself have seen during many years of travel since
my arrival here, the actual situation is something else ... In short, it can be said
that these people are on the same level as bugs.”
Until the middle of the first centuryce, outside of a few imperial outposts,
local rulers limited the influence of Han officials. These local rulers can be seen
riding in boats that decorate the large bronze drums that announced their
authority. In their graves of boat-shaped wooden coffins, they have left their
weapons, tools, jewelry, and daily life items made of wood, pottery, bronze, and
iron. From such things, and from brief written descriptions by imperial officials
compiled in later books, we can vaguely see the society ruled by these people.
Imperial officials called them Lac (Chinese Luo) and Au (Chinese Ou), which
they understood as kinds of Viet (Chinese Yue), a name applied to southern non-
Han people.
The Lac people were rice growers in the Red River plain. The Au had
arrived with King An Duong, who combined his entourage with the existing
class of rulers to produce what was recorded as the kingdom of Au-Lac. The
Lac lords had previously served the ruler dethroned by King An Duong. In later
centuries, historians used the name Hung for those who ruled before King An
Duong at the place where the Red River emerges from the mountains, called
Me Linh in old texts. It would have been easy for this place to be in contact
with other bronze-age cultures up the Red River to the northwest in what
are now the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. King An Duong’s
fortress of Co Loa was in the upper plain north of the Red River, located to
dominate the plain while defending it from intruders coming from the north-
east, either along the coast or through the upland passes leading to Zhao To’s
kingdom of Nan Yue in the modern Chinese provinces of Guangdong and
Guangxi.
One detail in the earliest versions of the story of King An Duong and Zhao
To can be related to the archaeology of Co Loa. Cao Thong (Chinese Kao
Tong), a man described in such a way as to indicate that he was from China,
was the chief advisor of King An Duong as well as the inventor of the magic
crossbow. As long as King An Duong retained the loyalty of Cao Thong, Zhao
To could not defeat him. However, King An Duong treated Cao Thong disres-
pectfully, and Cao Thong abandoned him. Thereafter, King An Duong lost
the magic crossbow and was defeated. The archaeology of Co Loa reveals an
adaptation of engineering practices from the Warring States of ancient China
to the local terrain and a range of weapons similar to contemporary armies

in China, which suggests that King An Duong’s magic weapon may have been
some kind of“new model army” trained and led by Cao Thong, which was no
longer effective without his leadership.
After Zhao To had expelled King An Duong, he posted two legates to super-
vise the Au-Lac lords, one in the Red River plain, which was named Giao Chi,
and one in the Ma and Ca River plains immediately to the south, which was
named Cuu Chan. Some records suggest that he also invested a king at Co Loa
who continued to preside over the Au-Lac lords. The legates established com-
mercial outposts accessible by sea. Their presence was apparently unobjection-
able to the Au-Lac lords, for there is no record of trouble between them. Access
to stable markets with goods from the north was surely a benefit to the local
rulers. For the next century and a half, no recorded information survives about
this place. The local organization of society and politics apparently remained
fundamentally unchanged in the transfer from Hung kings to King An Duong to
the kingdom of Nan Yue. The next transfer of suzerain also did not bring any
drastic change.
When the Han General Lu Bode conquered Nan Yue in111 bce, his army
was met at the Giao Chi border by the two Nan Yue legates with cattle, wine,
and tokens of submission. At that time, an Au-Lac lord received a titular
reward from Han for overthrowing the king who had been invested by Nan
Yue at Co Loa. Han subsequently established two new outposts as frontier
garrisons, one facing northwest, up the Red River into the mountains at Me
Linh where the Hung kings had supposedly ruled, and one facing the southern
coast in Nhat Nam, on the plain between the Ngang and Hai Van Passes
beyond Cuu Chan. The headquarters for Giao Chi and the entire region was
at Luy Lau, a seaport amidst fields connected by river with the coast leading
north.
Giao Chi, Cuu Chan, and Nhat Nam were given the status of prefectures in
Han imperial administration. A total of twenty-two districts were organized, or
at least theorized, in these prefectures, ten in Giao Chi, seven in Cuu Chan, and
five in Nhat Nam. The districts were left in the hands of local lords who received
imperial“seals and ribbons” as symbols of their status in return for what the
lords viewed as tribute to a suzerain but which imperial officials over time began
to view as taxes. Although this situation, so far as surviving evidence reveals,
remained peaceful for the next century and a half, the accommodation achieved
between a feudal aristocracy and the Han practice of prefecture and district
administration was an expedient and would not be sustainable in the long run.
Han officials sought to maintain peaceful relations with the local population
while pursuing the complex, sometimes contradictory, goals of imperial adminis-
tration. These goals included patrolling the frontiers to ensure security,

monitoring the local leaders to maintain domestic tranquility, nurturing trade
and agriculture to produce a taxable surplus, encouraging northern immigration
to consolidate a mass of people directly responsive to imperial authority, and
seeking opportunities to change local ways toward northern norms with educa-
tion and social reform. The perspective of the Han officials was largely limited to
their prefectural headquarters and garrisons and the security of the river routes
that connected these places. They met with the lords who governed districts to
receive a portion of the local surplus and to confer tokens of imperial authority
and benevolence.
For their part, the lords upon whom Han officials were dependent for
governing the non-Han population inhabited a world very different from Han
people. Theirs was the realm of the Lac, and of the Au who during this time were
probably for the most part absorbed into the Lac. People today apply the
archaeological name of Dong Son to their culture. Here were communities of
agriculturalists settled along riverbanks beside rice fields. The rulers sent men by
boat to collect rice and other goods, armed with crossbows, spears, swords, and
their distinctive bronze pediform axes. They proclaimed their arrival by beating
on bronze drums to summon the people to submit what was due. Many of these
drums still exist and are decorated with scenes of the boats bearing warriors with
weapons, large jars to carry rice, and the drums. There are also depictions of
people wearing clothing decorated with feathers. Some are pounding rice in large
mortars with long wooden pestles. There are musicians and dancers, men and
women copulating, and warriors holding decapitated heads. The drums also bear
images of birds, deer, crocodiles, and frogs. The rulers of this society met with
Han officials to exchange gifts and to gain access to markets with goods from
afar, and they were buried with their weapons, wooden combs, bracelets,
ceramic pillows, and Han coins.
An imperial census was taken in the year2c e. It recorded143,643 households
and 981,755 people in the three prefectures of Giao Chi, Cuu Chan, and Nhat
Nam. It is doubtful that these enumerations came from an actual registration of
the population or even that they were a compilation of estimates. It was at this
time that some prefects in remote jurisdictions endeavored to become famous for
claiming to have promoted agriculture and patriarchal marriage rites, activities
related to the taking of a census. They typically made impressive but unverifiable
claims seeking to gain a reputation that would lead to more desirable assign-
ments nearer the imperial heartland.
Despite many problems in evaluating the accuracy of this census, it is neverthe-
less plausible evidence for the existence of a settled population in the lowlands of
what is now northern Vietnam that was significant and substantial in the context
of imperial administration in ancient China. This is apparent in comparison with

numbers in the same census recorded from the modern southern Chinese prov-
inces of Guangxi and Guangdong, even allowing for the certainty of error and
fiction:71,805 households and 390,555 people, less than half the households
and only around40 percent of the people recorded for the prefectures in modern
Vietnam.
Who were these people and what language did they speak? Han immigrants
aside, we can plausibly conjecture that much of the lowland population spoke
what linguists call Proto-Viet-Muong related to the Mon-Khmer language family
that apparently expanded northward from the Ca River plain in modern Nghe
An and Ha Tinh Provinces. The geographical connection with other Mon-Khmer
languages appears to have been via the Mu Gia Pass from the middle Mekong
plain to the Ca River plain. Another plausible conjecture is that the aristocracy
that ruled these people, called Lac in Han texts, came from the mountains north
and west of the Red River plain and spoke an ancient language related to modern
Khmu, another Mon-Khmer language now spoken in the mountains of northern
Vietnam and Laos. On the other hand, the Au conquerers who arrived from the
northern mountains with King An Duong might be imagined to have spoken a
language related to the Tai-Kadai language family that includes modern Lao and
Thai. In any case, it is too early to speak of the Vietnamese language.
The Han conquest
During the years9–23 ce, the empire was in turmoil as a so-called usurper
named Wang Mang tried to supplant the Han dynasty. Uprisings spread disorder
in northern China, and fighting continued until a Han prince restored the
authority of his dynasty. During this time, officials in southern China remained
loyal to Han. Many Han loyalists fled from the north seeking safety in what is
now southern China and northern Vietnam. After the Han restoration, large
numbers of the officials who had found refuge in the south returned north, but
some remained and established families that would be prominent in local gov-
ernment for centuries after. This wave of refugees from the north strengthened
Han officials in their dealings with local peoples during this short but tumultuous
era and accelerated the ascendancy of imperial administration over the Lac
aristocracy.
Han administrative activity in these years reflects an accumulation of immi-
gration from the north as well as growing familiarity and experience with local
conditions. Han officials began to extend the sphere of their direct authority over
increasing numbers of inhabitants. Some of these were immigrants from the
north settled near Han garrisons and administrative centers. Others were local

people who either lived near these places or were attracted to migrate there for
economic opportunities or for the security provided by direct imperial rule. Han
centers surely attracted refugees from the politics of the Lac lords and the
vicissitudes of local society. By this time, Han administrators had apparently
established a presence at the district level where they were in a position to
intervene in relations between Lac lords and local people. Han officials
endeavored to draw the Lac lords into the hierarchy of Han government,
to teach them to observe the norms of Han civilization and administration.
This effort was probably successful in some cases, but in other cases produced
non-cooperation and resistance.
Contradictions grew between Han government and Lac lords. Han officials
were appointees in an imperial administrative system; Lac lords were hereditary
aristocrats in something like a feudal system. Han officials organized and regis-
tered families in a structure that governed through the responsibility of patriarchs
to control their subordinates and to pay taxes; the status of Lac lords passed
through the family line of one’s mother and tribute was obtained from commu-
nities of agriculturalists who practiced group responsibility. For Han people,
land and inheritance rights were possessed by men; in Lac society, access to land
was based on communal usage rather than individual ownership and women
possessed inheritance rights.
Immigrants from the north included officials, soldiers, agriculturalists, and
technical experts of various kinds who married local women and obtained land.
The contradiction between the Han practice of land being inherited through the
male line and the Lac practice of land rights being inherited through the female
line came to a head with these people. In mixed marriages, the conflicting
interests of male and female offspring were aligned with the discordant regimes
of Han administrators and Lac lords. At stake was control of land and access to
the taxable agricultural surplus.
While in Han society men inherited wealth through their fathers, in Lac society
both men and women inherited wealth through their mothers. As late as the third
centuryce, an imperial administrator wrote disapprovingly that levirate was still
practiced in areas where Lac traditions remained strongest. This meant that
childless widows had a right to bear children with men from their deceased
husbands’ families in order to obtain heirs. This practice ostensibly provided
an heir for the mother, although some patriarchal societies used it to provide an
heir for the deceased father. A woman’s prerogative to bear children for
her family line may lie behind an observation from that time and place that local
women were difficult to control and that aspiring patriarchs attached bells to
the ears of their wives to prevent them from sneaking off at night to be with
other men.

According to Han historical records, in the fourth decade of the first century
ce, a Lac lord was“tied up with the law” by the Han prefect of Giao Chi. This
provoked an uprising led by two women, daughters of another Lac lord, who
were married to the“tied up” lord. These were the famous Trung Sisters who in
later centuries became heroines of Vietnamese history. The details of what
happened can only be conjectured. If the“law” referred to had to do with land
ownership and inheritance rights, a plausible scenario is that Han officials
endeavored to restrain a man who was championing the inheritance rights of
women to whom he was related by marriage against efforts by the imperial
regime to assert Han ideas about land ownership. But there may have been other
issues at stake as well, for the Trung Sisters were from Me Linh, the locality
where the Hung kings were said to have ruled before the time of King An Duong,
so they may have been infused with a venerable tradition of authority.
Han descriptions of northern Vietnam compiled three to four centuries later
say that the most distinguishing feature of Me Linh was the presence of big
beautiful snakes that could be captured only by covering them with women’s
clothing. If this indication of female potency were imagined as a remnant of
thought about there once being Hung queens rather than Hung kings in this
place, it would offer an explanatory context to the fact that when Han settle-
ments and garrisons were overrun in the spring of40 cethe Trung Sisters then
ruled as queens from Me Linh. These queens established their influence over the
Han jurisdictions in northern Vietnam of Giao Chi, Cuu Chan, and Nhat Nam,
and also a prefecture on the coast to the north that today is within the Chinese
border.
The Trung Sisters reigned for two years until a Han expeditionary force was
organized and put in motion. The only detail about their rule that remains from
Han historical records is that they“adjusted taxes,” which suggests that the most
inflammatory issue leading to the uprising was control of land and agricultural
surplus– an important target of Han taxation. It might also refer to control of
the markets and taxation of local commodities that were sought by Han mer-
chants. These were primarily luxury goods such as rhinoceros horns, elephant
tusks, tropical bird feathers, pearls, aromatic woods, and slaves. Rulers in
northern China had by then already been coveting these items for centuries.
Two and a half centuries earlier, Qin Shi Huang’s attention had been drawn to
the south by the trade in these goods. Considerations of frontier security, revenue
from a relatively large agricultural population, and access to tropical commod-
ities all contributed to the Han determination to regain control of this region.
One climatic feature that has affected warfare in Vietnam for centuries is the
monsoon rains. During the warm months when temperatures rise on the Eur-
asian land mass, winds from the sea bring rain, and sometimes typhoons,

beginning in May and extending into October. The land becomes waterlogged
and will not sustain the movement of large armies. As temperatures fall during
the cooler months, from November to April, winds blow out to sea and the land
dries out making it possible for large armies to move.
In the dry season of early42 ce, General Ma Yuan led a Han army into the
Red River plain, building a road along the coast as he came. Ma Yuan estab-
lished his headquarters near King An Duong’s fortress of Co Loa and camped
there during the soggy months of the monsoon rain season, from May to
October. Around the end of the year, as the land dried out and the fighting
season opened, he captured and beheaded the Trung Sisters after a series of
battles in which thousands of their followers were killed, were captured, or had
surrendered. He spent the next year receiving the submission of local leaders,
tracking down and killing those who refused to submit, deporting hundreds of
prominent clans to the north, building fortified towns from which localities could
be governed, establishing garrisons, and settling his soldiers on land from which
they could supply their own provisions. He also issued regulations to eliminate
the contradictions between Han law and local practice, and he took oaths of
loyalty from those who submitted. Having established a foundation for direct
imperial governance, he returned north in44 ce.
The expedition of Ma Yuan ended the age that historians associate with Lac
lords and that archaeologists associate with Dong Son Culture. It came two and a
half centuries after Qin Shi Huang’s imperial armies crossed the passes into
southern China, initiating recorded history in this region with the frontier
perceptions of Han administrators and the legendary struggle between King An
Duong and Zhao To. Local society and the people who ruled it do not appear to
have experienced any major disruption as Han officials garrisoned headquarters
at a few strategic locations and began to attract immigrants from the north. As
years went by, however, contradictions between imperial policy and local prac-
tice grew ever more apparent and eventually led to the violence of the40s ce.
Stories about relations between imperial administrators and the local society
during this long era of coexistence were compiled in a book annotated in its
present form around five centuries later entitledShui Jing Zhu(Commentary on
the Waterways Classic). The stories are about boundaries between the realms of
human beings and animals with the humans standing for imperial civilization
and animals standing for uncivilized locals. Three stories are attributed to three
regions of the Red River plain. One of these is the story, mentioned above, about
the big beautiful snakes at Me Linh. This is where the Hung kings or queens are
thought to have ruled and also where the Trung Sisters held court. The snakes
are entirely in the animal realm, and the point of the story is how to capture and
kill them.

Another story is located in the region of Co Loa, where King An Duong ruled.
It is about chimpanzees able to transform themselves into creatures with hand-
some human heads that spoke using elegant language that moved the emotions of
human listeners. Humans ate the delicious flesh of these creatures in time of
famine. This story of an animal able to enter the human realm with its face and
speech is a metaphor for local people who learned some aspects of civilization.
But that they were eaten in an emergency indicates that for civilized people they
nevertheless remained animals.
The third story comes from Luy Lau, the Han administrative center established
at the seaport facing the northern coast. Here a Han administrator became
famous for having transformed himself into a tiger and then later returned
himself back into a man. This story is about a representative of imperial civiliza-
tion penetrating the animal world and taking control of it in the form of the most
ferocious of beasts, then returning to the human realm.
These stories reflect perceptions of three different regions, but they also reflect
three phases in a process of contact between local people and Han officials. The
big snake is utterly beyond human civilization and must be killed. The talking
chimpanzees assumed some civilized characteristics and were interesting but
could never become members of the civilized human world. The Han tiger-man
learned to enter and master the realm of savagery yet remained a civilized man
and an imperial official. These stories present metaphors for three policies:
extermination of the uncivilized, allowing the uncivilized to acquire some aspects
of civilization, and penetrating the uncivilized realm and dominating it with
imperial versions of uncivilized potency.
In the same book where these stories are recorded, each of these three places is
also associated with an emblematic military encounter. At Me Linh, Ma Yuan
defeated and killed the Trung Sisters. Co Loa is the scene of the struggle for
ascendancy between King An Duong and Zhao To, two aspiring monarchs on
the imperial frontier. The battle recorded for Luy Lau is an event that took place
in the year411 when a rebel army fleeing from imperial forces in southern China
entered northern Vietnam and attempted to seize control of it; the loyal imperial
governor rallied the frontier province against the invading rebel and defeated
him. These episodes show a shift of perspective on northern Vietnam from a
place of disorder where uncivilized people were slain to a place where semi-
civilized kingdoms competed for dominance on the edge of the civilized world to
a loyal civilized province that overcame rebellious forces emanating from the
imperial heartland.
For nine hundred years following the expedition of Ma Yuan, the southern-
most province of successive dynastic empires was in northern Vietnam. During
this time, every aspect of society and culture was transformed by education in the

Confucian and Daoist classics, by the arrival of Buddhism and its synthesis with
local religious practices, by waves of immigrants, by imperial ideals of political
organization and social behavior, and by a transformation of languages, both
Annamese Middle Chinese that developed among the Chinese speakers and
Proto-Viet-Muong spoken by the non-Chinese population, in a context of cen-
turies of bilingualism. The series of acculturating episodes during this time
progressively turned the lives and aspirations of people inhabiting this place
toward the civilization in the north.
There was no further mention of the name Lac. Instead, the people here were
recorded as Viet (Chinese Yue). As a name, Viet had a relatively prominent
imperial pedigree. Although it was a designation for southern non-Han peoples,
it nevertheless indicated a kind of uncivilized people that were redeemable.
A kingdom named Yue/Viet was one of the“warring states” of ancient China
in the sixth to fourth centuriesbce, on the southern coast of the civilized world
near the mouth of the Yangtze River. Its most famous ruler, King Goujian (fifth
centurybce), claimed descent from a sage-king in antiquity. His people, origin-
ally considered civilized, had assumed uncivilized aspects through long residence
among uncivilized peoples. Consequently, the Yue/Viet were thought of as a kind
of uncivilized people predisposed toward the civilizing process. This was a name
for people on the threshold of civilization who had the options of going over the
threshold, of turning away, or of looking both ways.
Shi Xie and the rise of the great families
For fifty years after Ma Yuan’s expedition, Han power was at its peak. Very little
information about the southern frontier during this time was recorded by imper-
ial historians, which may be taken as an indication that, in the wake of Ma
Yuan’s frontier sojourn, the situation was relatively calm. When events began to
be recorded, in the second century, they were about invasions, rebellions, and
political turmoil. Ma Yuan left most of his army in Giao Chi, Cuu Chan, and
Nhat Nam to form the core of what became a frontier garrison. Large numbers
of Han soldiers, administrators, merchants, craftspeople, agriculturalists, and
adventurers came and went. Many of these people remained to take advantage of
opportunities on the new frontier.
Ma Yuan’s expedition is the pivot for a dramatic shift in archaeological
evidence. Han-style brick tombs replace Dong Son graves. These tombs are
nearly identical with tombs found throughout the Han Empire, being under-
ground chambers covered by mounds of earth and containing coins, jewelry,
lamps, figurines, utensils, mirrors, ceramics, weapons, and other miscellaneous

items, all typical of Han culture. Among the artifacts found in these tombs are
clay models of agricultural compounds with wells, ovens, granaries, pens for
animals, residential quarters, and walls with towers for defense. Such clay models
are found in Han tombs everywhere and indicate the basic composition of Han
society in the first and second centuriesce, a social structure that continued in
various forms until the sixth century in southern China and northern Vietnam.
Historians of China refer to this as the age of“great family dominance,”
meaning that“great families,” or agglomerations of people and property under
the authority of kin groups, whether actual or fictive, constituted government
at the local and provincial levels and dominated imperial administration outside
of the capital region and of strategically located garrisons. These were similar to
the latifundia in the Roman Empire and the hacienda of colonial Latin America,
which emerged from contexts of imperial conquest and appropriation of land,
manpower, and other resources. As economic units, they were typically based on
control of large tracts of agricultural land worked by peasants and herders in
various forms of servitude or dependency, but they could also include craftsmen
with specialized skills, for example in ceramics, bronze and iron ware, wood-
working, fishing and pearl diving, salt making, ivory carving, precious stones
and metals, and the production of incense from aromatic wood. There would
also have been scholars, scribes, teachers, medical doctors, priests, monks,
soldiers, spies, assassins, alchemists, and magicians, all of whom were employed
to serve the interests of the group of people composing the“great family,”
constituted by birth, adoption, marriage, or some other expedient.
The “great families” were economic and social units that brought together
local people and immigrants or sojourners from the north. They were arenas
with potential for upward social mobility for local people having skills, apti-
tudes, and attributes in demand by those in power. They were also places where
northerners could find opportunities for employment and possible advancement.
The people who presided at the very top of these“great families” were buried in
the vaulted brick tombs. They were either northerners and their descendents or
local people who had assimilated into the imperial governing class. The tombs
indicate a fundamental regional stability of imperial society despite the vicissi-
tudes of dynastic politics during the five hundred years following Ma Yuan’s
expedition.
During the first to sixth centuries, thousands of these tombs were built in the
rice lands of Giao Chi, Cuu Chan, and Nhat Nam. They are today found as far
south as the region of modern Quang Trach (Ba Don) in Quang Binh Province,
on the Gianh River just south of Ngang pass. It is not coincidental that at this
place the distribution of the brick tombs reached its southernmost extent. After
the fall of Han, Ngang Pass became the southern border of the provincial

jurisdictions inhabited by the ancestors of modern Vietnamese. The Han juris-
diction of Nhat Nam had its northern border at Ngang Pass and it became a
contested frontier zone between Sino-Vietnamese, later Vietnamese, and other
peoples generally called Cham. Not until the fifteenth century did Vietnamese
armies decisively conquer this area and open the southern coast to Vietnamese
immigrants.
By the beginning of the seventeenth century, Vietnamese along this southern
coast had established their own separate political system, and for two centuries
the Gianh River was the border between northern and southern Vietnamese
kingdoms. Decades of warfare ensued. Thirty kilometers south, at Dong Hoi,
the southerners built a system of defensive walls from the mountains to the sea to
block northern invasions. Seventy kilometers south of Dong Hoi is the Ben Hai
River at the seventeenth parallel, the border between warring northern and
southern Vietnamese states for twenty years in the mid twentieth century.
This region was the southern extremity of the Han Empire at its greatest extent,
and thereafter it remained a border zone of one kind or another. There are at least
four reasons for this: geography, climate, political history, and human activity in
response to these factors. North of Ngang Pass, the plains of the Red, Ma, and Ca
Rivers form a coherent geographical space of rice lands amidst large rivers and
mountainous terrain with possibilities for defense against external threats. Major
rivers all lead west-northwest into the highlands of southwest China and northern
Laos. These plains are at the southern edge of the temperate climatic zone, having
four seasons with cold, if brief, winters. Wresting an agricultural life from flooding
rivers and the salty sea instilled a disciplined lifestyle. Internalizing the social
organization and cultural ideals acquired from centuries of participation in an
imperial world added new forms of discipline. Communal responsibility and
deference to authority remain strong among northern Vietnamese.
The southern border of the Han jurisdiction of Nhat Nam was Hai Van Pass,
located between the modern cities of Hue and Da Nang. South from Hai Van
Pass, one enters the tropics and a coastal environment with greater exposure to
the outside world of seafaring and maritime trade routes than is possible on the
more northerly coasts facing Hainan Island. Here the Cham peoples, and later
the southern Vietnamese, found scope for a more diversified economic, social,
and cultural life than was possible further north. The mountainous hinterland
communicates with the central Mekong and territories inhabited by ancient
Khmer speakers and, more recently, by Tai speakers.
The coastal plain between Ngang Pass and Hai Van Pass is a transitional zone
that includes both temperate and tropical climatic features. Han-era Nhat Nam
was anchored in its north with a society in the plain of the Gianh River and its
tributaries that produced the Han-style brick tombs. Here was sited the

headquarters for commanders of garrisons and patrols that maintained watch as
far south as Hai Van Pass. In the second century, as Han power began to decline,
frontier disorders in Nhat Nam began to multiply, leading by the end of that
century to abandonment of the entire jurisdiction. During that time, the people of
Giao Chi and Cuu Chan repeatedly mobilized in response to these disorders and
came to understand that with the ebbing of Han power their security increasingly
depended upon their taking for themselves the responsibility of regional leader-
ship. The story of how this happened is about the first inkling of local political
initiative after the shock of Ma Yuan’s conquest, which had been followed by
several generations of immigration, intermarriage, and acculturation in the con-
text of the“great family” estates.
At the center of this story is a family that traced its ancestry to refugees from
Shandong Province in northeastern China that had fled into the south during the
Wang Mang disorders at the beginning of the first centuryce. This family settled
at the headquarters commanding the frontier jurisdiction comprised of southern
China and northern Vietnam, located at Cangwu (modern Wuzhou) on the
present border of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces in southern China. Here
a main route over the mountains from the north met the West River, about420
kilometers northeast of the modern Sino-Vietnamese border. During the years
from the late140s to the late160s, the leader of this family, Shi Si, served as the
chief administrative officer of Nhat Nam. These were critical years in the unrav-
eling of the southern Han frontier, and Shi Si served there at a time when
especially talented and trusted men were assigned to rule by force of personality
in lieu of reliance upon military force only.
During the previous decade, in 137 and again in 144, Han outposts and
settlements in Nhat Nam were overrun by uprisings originating in the southern-
most part of the jurisdiction, provoking turmoil and the breakdown of Han
authority in Cuu Chan as well. A disorder similar to these had been put down by
force in the year100, subsequent to which there were several episodes of local
peoples immigrating into the areas of Han administration and submitting to Han
authority. Since this was also the time when Han power began to decline, Han
administration was apparently unequal to the task of carrying out its civilizing
mandate among these new subjects or of keeping them at peace. When Nhat
Nam erupted in137 and 144, Han was no longer capable of sending large
numbers of soldiers so far south. Consequently, a policy was implemented in
which men were selected for their prior experience and success in dealing with
non-Han peoples on the frontier and were sent to calm the situation through
persuasion and charisma. Shi Si was such a person. In160, when disorders once
more broke out in Nhat Nam and Cuu Chan, Han officials again negotiated
peace without resort to arms.

The progressive ebbing of Han power, however, continued to offer new
opportunities for frontier adventurers. Nhat Nam was temporarily stabilized,
but in the160s uprisings began to break out further north in what is now
southern China. The 170s were a time of contention among Han officials in
southern China and northern Vietnam, where loyalty to the distant Han court
was increasingly eroded by personal ambition. By the180s, imperial appoint-
ments to prominent local men recognized an emerging arrangement of regional
autonomy.
At that time, Shi Si’s eldest son, Shi Xie, was appointed to govern Giao Chi.
For the next forty years, Shi Xie kept Giao Chi and Cuu Chan in peace, while all
around swirled the consequences of Han collapse. One of these consequences in
the early190s was the appearance of the kingdom of Lin Yi in southern Nhat
Nam. The people of Lin Yi included groups from both the coast and the adjacent
uplands along with Han renegades. Lin Yi must also have had some contact, if
not connection, with Cham peoples led by kings in the region beyond Nhat
Nam’s border, south of Hai Van Pass. As portrayed in later Chinese records, the
logic for the existence of this kingdom was to exploit opportunities for probing,
plundering, and appropriating territories in imperial frontier jurisdictions. For
much of the next four centuries, Lin Yi would be a chronic adversary for those
who governed the Red River plain. It nevertheless appears that Shi Xie managed
to maintain a modus vivendi with this nascent power.
In his youth, Shi Xie had been sent north to study with a famous scholar. He
subsequently served as a secretary at the Han court, then returned south to
mourn for his father, and thereafter served as an administrator in Sichuan in
western China before being appointed to govern Giao Chi. This appointment
was based upon both his personal qualities and his position as head of the Shi
family, which had become prominent on the southern frontier. In the190s, the
lapse of imperial control in the south enabled Shi Xie to appoint three of his
brothers to govern Cuu Chan and the coastal regions of modern Guangxi and
Guangdong in southern China. Shi Xie governed from Luy Lau, about thirty
kilometers east of modern Hanoi, where his tomb can be seen to this day.
Around a hundred scholars fleeing the collapse of Han found refuge with Shi
Xie. Shi Xie was remembered among later generations of Vietnamese as the
father of education in their land. He reportedly built schools and encouraged
lively debates among the intellectuals who gathered around him, including
Confucianists, Daoists, and Buddhists. Centuries later, he was credited with
compiling a dictionary explaining classical terms in vernacular Vietnamese for
use in schools. He surrounded himself with Buddhist monks, and the building of
the earliest known Vietnamese Buddhist temples is attributed to him. The story
about how Buddhism originated among the Vietnamese connects him to the first

appearance of a Buddha in this land, a Mother Buddha who miraculously gave
birth to a daughter who, via a tale entwined with the worship of trees and rocks,
became embodied in images of four sister Buddhas with rain-making powers.
One of these, the Dharma Cloud Buddha, was particularly worshipped by
imperial governors and also by Vietnamese kings as late as the eighteenth
century. Shi Xie’s posthumous cult also credited him with Daoist powers of
immortality. In short, Shi Xie is associated with the introduction of every major
aspect of what came to define Vietnamese culture. This is why in his study of Shi
Xie, Stephen O’Harrow called him“the first Vietnamese.”
Giao Province
Shi Xie was termed a“king” in Vietnamese writings of later centuries, but during
his lifetime he posed as a loyal official of the Han court until this was no longer
plausible, at which point he shifted his allegiance to the rising Wu dynasty in
southeastern China, one of the three kingdoms that partitioned the Han Empire
in the early third century. After Shi Xie’s death in226, the Wu moved quickly to
exterminate the Shi family and to gain control of northern Vietnam. Cut off from
the Silk Road across Central Asia to northern China, the Wu wanted direct
access to the maritime route to India and the Mediterranean Sea, for which
northern Vietnam had become a terminus during the rule of Shi Xie. Wu
exactions and resort to harsh expedients provoked resistance, and in248 the
leader of Lin Yi took advantage of this to seize northern Nhat Nam, inspiring
local leaders in Cuu Chan and Giao Chi to rebel against the Wu regime. The Wu
calmed the situation with conciliation, resorting to force only to suppress resist-
ance in southern Cuu Chan led by a woman remembered in Vietnamese texts as
Lady Trieu. Despite these successes, the Wu made no effort to re-enter Nhat
Nam.
The Wu kingdom, locked in continual war with its rivals in northern and
western China, treated Giao Chi and Cuu Chan primarily as sources of wealth,
which was not a popular policy among the people who lived there. In the260s,
the Wei of northern China conquered the Shu Han dynasty of western China in
Sichuan and thereafter became the Jin dynasty, thereby reducing the Three
Kingdoms to two. Local leaders in Giao Chi sent envoys to Sichuan to offer
their allegiance to the Jin, Wu’s remaining enemy. In response, the Jin sent a
governor with seven military commanders and their men to establish an anti-Wu
regime in northern Vietnam. There followed three years of fighting between Wu
forces attempting to regain control of the Red River plain and Jin forces
endeavoring to prevent this. Local forces were initially allied with Jin. However,

when Tao Huang, an astute Wu commander, sent treasure that he had seized
from the Jin contingent to a prominent local leader, thousands of local troops
shifted their allegiance to Wu. The Jin soldiers were soon besieged and forced to
surrender.
Tao Huang thereafter governed northern Vietnam, now known as Giao Prov-
ince, for around twenty-five years, until near the end of the third century; the
exact year is unknown. Just as had been the case with Shi Xie, he governed
during a time of dynastic change in the north. In280, Jin conquered Wu. Based
far away in northern China, Jin was content to confirm Tao Huang’s appoint-
ment as governor of Giao, where he continued to serve until his death. Tao
Huang was known as a patron of Buddhism. He also established an adminis-
trative structure for Giao Province that lasted through several dynastic regimes.
A salient feature of this structure was the formation of three new frontier
jurisdictions. Two of these were in Giao Chi facing the mountains to the north
and to the west; one was in southern Cuu Chan facing the old Nhat Nam border.
Tao Huang endeavored to re-establish some semblance of authority in Nhat
Nam, proclaiming an economic embargo against markets in Nhat Nam and
garrisoning soldiers on the frontier, but there is no evidence that he achieved
more than a temporary stabilization of the border. On the contrary, his efforts
appear to have done little more than elicit attacks by Lin Yi.
During the first two decades of the fourth century, warring princes tore the Jin
dynasty apart and various groups of non-Han peoples conquered northern
China, sending a great wave of refugees into southern China, where a Jin prince
reassembled the dynasty from his base on the lower Yangtze. During this time,
Giao Province was left to its own devices with a regime over which local leaders
invited prominent members of old Wu families to preside as governors.
In the 320s, the newly constituted Jin court in southern China was strong
enough to begin sending soldiers to Giao in efforts to gain control of the
government there. As in the previous century when Wu attempted to gain
ascendancy and local powers turned to the Jin in Sichuan, local powers in Giao
now resisted Jin, inspired by the Cheng Han dynasty that had arisen in Sichuan
in opposition to Jin. Meanwhile, Jin immigrants were seeking their fortunes in
the south by pushing aside the old Wu families that had come to the fore in the
late third century; Giao Province was the last place of refuge for these families.
The Jin dynasty finally established its authority in Giao in the330s, after Jin
troops had cut communications between Sichuan and northern Vietnam; within
a decade, Jin gained control of Sichuan and removed that option entirely. Jin
forces were concerned to get a grip on the southern frontier because the turmoil
of the preceding years had attracted the unwelcome attention of Lin Yi. In the
340s, Lin Yi armies, commanded by a king of Han ancestry who had traveled

extensively in China as a merchant and knew of conditions in China at first hand,
began a series of raids into Giao, culminating in a full-scale invasion in347. Jin
mobilized soldiers from Giao and the province of Guang (modern Guangdong
and Guangxi in southern China) for a major effort against Lin Yi. In349, the Jin
army advanced as far as the Gianh River, the former headquarters of Han-era
Nhat Nam, where it was defeated and forced to withdraw. The Lin Yi king was
mortally wounded in this battle, but his son continued the policy of attacking
Giao until defeated by another Jin expedition in359.
The mobilizations of men and resources for the expeditions of349 and 359
bore heavily upon Giao and even provoked some dissention among provincial
officials. But after Lin Yi had been quieted, Jin interest in Giao rapidly faded as
the imperial court became preoccupied with other threats. In the late370s, the
governorship fell vacant and the prefect of Cuu Chan, the leader of a prominent
local family named Li Xun, seized control of provincial affairs.
In 380, the Jin court sent Teng Dunzhi to be governor and Li Xun, perceiving that
imperial power was weakening, opted to resist him. However, the head of another
leading Giao family, Du Yuan, then serving as the prefect of Giao Chi, took the
opportunity to further his ambitions by killing Li Xun and welcoming Teng Dunzhi.
The Du family then stood at the head of provincial affairs for the next forty-seven
years. Teng Dunzhi remained in Giao as governor for nineteen years, during which
the Du family enjoyed preeminence in provincial administration.
Du Yuan’s grandfather was originally from Chang’an (Xi’an) in northern
China and had been assigned to a post in modern Guangxi near the Giao border
early in the fourth century before the fall of northern China in311. He subse-
quently settled in Giao during the time when Jin authority was being established
there, apparently participating in that process. The family was prominent in Giao
throughout the century of Jin rule.
Shortly after Teng Dunzhi’s departure in399, Giao was surprised by a Lin Yi
invasion that succeeded in placing the provincial capital under siege. Du Yuan
mobilized provincial forces and counterattacked, rapidly pushing the invaders
back across the border. Shortly thereafter, the Jin court appointed him governor.
When he died in410, his son Du Huidu succeeded to the governorship. When Du
Huidu died in423, his son Du Hongwen succeeded to the governorship, which
he occupied until427 when he received an appointment at the imperial court.
The Du family left in Giao a reputation for good government, reportedly using
benevolence and strictness as circumstances dictated. It was a time of dynastic
change as the Jin court declined and was replaced in420 by the Liu Song
dynasty, which was content to confirm Du Huidu as governor of Giao. During
these years, Giao faced a threat from its northern as well as from its southern
border.

In 410, Lu Xun, the governor of Guang, the province in southern China
adjacent to Giao, aimed to benefit from the feebleness of the Jin court by rebelling.
When defeated by a Jin general in411, Lu Xun led his army into Giao. There he
lost his life when defeated in battle by Du Huidu, who thereby protected both his
family’s ascendancy in Giao and its reputation for loyalty to the imperial court.
The more constant threat to Giao was in the south, where fighting with Lin Yi
became chronic, with serious episodes of warfare breaking out in405–407, 413,
415, and 424. In each case, Lin Yi attacks were repulsed, but to eliminate the
problem would take more resources than Giao Province by itself could provide.
Although the ascendancy of the Liu Song dynasty in Giao was brief (for less than
half a century), yet because of the need to respond to Lin Yi and because of major
social, cultural, and economic developments during that time, important changes
occurred in Giao. Unlike the expeditions organized in the fourth century by Jin
against Lin Yi that relied heavily upon local resources, the Liu Song expedition
came after several years of preparation that energized Giao with a prosperous
imperial economy.
During the fourth century, Jin military leadership had been relatively diffuse,
exercised by prominent émigrés who fled into the south after the loss of northern
China in311. These émigrés and their heirs continued to command the armies,
keeping the emperors in a position of weakness. This changed when, in420, the
founder of the Liu Song dynasty concentrated control of the military in his own
hands. The Liu Song era in the mid fifth century saw a major shift in the structure
of politics and society with significant economic effects. Rather than martial
prowess, the élite class of émigrés was encouraged to display literary accomplish-
ments at court, where their status relations were carefully monitored. Those
uninterested in this turned to trade and business, aiming their ambitions at the
accumulation of wealth. The southernmost provinces, including Giao, attracted
the attention of these people as a frontier of opportunity, a place to exercise their
entrepreneurial and literary skills. This became an era of accelerating commercial
activity and great prosperity.
As the élite émigré class shifted its attention away from military affairs to
become a class of landed scholar gentry and urbanizing merchants, new wealth
gained from agriculture and commerce opened possibilities for luxury, for tax-
ation, for religion, and for investment. In Giao, this came after a century of stable
government under the Jin and Liu Song dynasties and the administration of the
Du family. In the440s, borders with the dynasties in northern China were calm
and did not distract merchants and adventurers from prospects in the far south,
and a famously successful expedition against Lin Yi accelerated prosperity by
destroying trading rivals on the southern coast and by infusing Giao with a great
store of booty.

In 443, Tan Hezhi, the governor of Giao, was instructed to recruit soldiers and
assemble supplies. He spent three years on this task, recruiting a formidable and
well-trained military force, preparing a fleet to transport it, and gathering suffi-
cient supplies for an extended campaign. He also enlisted the services of two
commanders famous for their battlefield successes on the northern borders of the
empire. In446, the army advanced down the coast into the old territory of Nhat
Nam. Defeating the Lin Yi king in several encounters, the expedition first sacked
the seaport on the Gianh River where the headquarters of Nhat Nam had once
been, then continued south to sack the citadel and palaces of the Lin Yi king near
modern Hue, in what had been the southernmost part of old Nhat Nam. The
expedition returned to Giao loaded with plunder. The Lin Yi that had contested
the frontier during the preceding two and a half centuries had been thoroughly
destroyed and the frontier was thereafter quiet for many years. What subse-
quently came to be called Lin Yi was from then based beyond the Hai Van Pass in
the region of modern Da Nang, a major center of culture and kingship for
Chams, who were ethno-linguistically related to the Malay peoples.
In Giao, the mid fifth century was a prosperous time. New lands were opened
for agriculture south of the Red River in the region of modern Hanoi, resulting in
the formation of a new prefecture there, an indication that the rural economy
was expanding. Governors sent to Giao by the imperial court in the late fifth
century had reputations for scholarly interests. They spent much time reading
books; one was famed for his calligraphy and another discussed philosophical
questions in a series of letters with two local Buddhist monks. Giao was a
desirable assignment for some men at court because of opportunities there for
making money. One man obtained appointment as governor in Giao after paying
a large sum; he then sold prefecture appointments to others, a percentage of the
profits from which he was obliged to pay to the court. These men believed that
such investments would be easily recovered, with profit added, by taking posts in
Giao. Giao was known as a place where private fortunes could be made.
The weak imperial court lost touch with distant provinces as government
service gave way to opportunities for personal ambition. In468, a local official
prevented a newly appointed governor from entering the province and subse-
quently obtained for himself the appointment as governor. In the470s, after this
man died, his nephew successively turned away at the provincial border three
men sent to be governor by the imperial court. Not until485, after a new
dynasty, the Qi, had restored some order to the empire, did an imperial army
escort a new governor into the province, prompting the local strongman to go
begging for mercy at the imperial court. But the potency of the Qi dynasty was
brief and only five years later a local official took advantage of a bookish
governor who neglected his duties to place him in confinement and report that

he was mentally incompetent; the court simply appointed the reporting official as
governor, acknowledging the existing situation. Provincial leaders in Giao had
learned to govern their own affairs while posing as imperial officials. During the
next century, as imperial power ebbed, Giao politics was primarily about con-
tests for dominance among local strongmen.
Imperial weakness and local heroes
When the Liang dynasty replaced the Qi at the beginning of the sixth century,
provincial leaders fell into factions that either resisted or favored the new
dynasty. The pro-Liang group gained ascendancy and ruled the province for
two decades, until a new system of imperial rule designed by Liang was extended
to Giao in the520s. During this time, unknown numbers of men from Giao
traveled to the imperial court seeking advancement.
Since the Jin dynasty’s loss of northern China in the early fourth century, the
court was located at modern Nanjing, around2,200 kilometers by land and
2,700 kilometers by sea from the Giao provincial capital. This distance is one
reason why, during the preceding two centuries, leaders in Giao were sensitive to
shifting dynastic fortunes at the imperial capital and developed habits of hand-
ling local affairs in their own way when it was necessary or possible to do so.
Nevertheless, politically active people in Giao, despite their relative remoteness
from the imperial center, were definitely educated and socialized to value their
place in the empire, for ambitious men from Giao did not shrink from taking the
long road to the imperial capital to advance their careers.
We know of two such men in the early sixth century, Ly Bi and Tinh Thieu,
because they were prominent in a rebellion that in541 drove Liang officials from
Giao. Ly Bi’s ancestors were reportedly among those who had fled into the south
from northern China during the Wang Mang disorders of the early first century
ce. For several generations, his lineage had been prominent in the military affairs
of Giao Province, and what is known of his career places him among officers
assigned to patrol the frontiers. He traveled to the Liang capital seeking a court
appointment, but his ambitions were thwarted for unknown reasons, and he
returned to Giao. He was joined in his frustration by Tinh Thieu, known as a
scholar, who had also gone to the Liang capital in hopes of advancement. Tinh
Thieu was chagrined to be disregarded because his family was unknown at court;
his literary aspirations were disdained and he felt himself to be insulted by being
assigned to oversee one of the gates in the city wall. Ly Bi and Tinh Thieu
eventually returned to Giao together. No others are mentioned in the records,
but there may very well have been a significant group of disappointed office

seekers from Giao at the Liang capital who gathered around Ly Bi and Tinh
Thieu. The subsequent rebellion led by them may have grown from the network
of personal relationships established among members of such a group.
In 541, Ly Bi mobilized “heroes from several provinces” to attack Liang
officials. These“heroes” are likely to have had unhappy imperial careers analo-
gous to his and Tinh Thieu’s. A time of relative imperial weakness encouraged an
exuberance of ambition among those who were imaginative and daring. The
“several provinces” is a reference to the Liang experiment in local administration
implemented in the520s, around the time that Ly Bi and Tinh Thieu returned to
Giao. It was an effort to harness the ambitions of such“heroes” to imperial
authority.
By this time, provincial government throughout the empire had, to a large
extent, devolved into the hands of powerful local families, to the point that the
imperial court aimed no further than to accept and regulate this state of affairs.
The court appointed prominent local figures to be governors of newly organized
small provinces while appointing members of the imperial family to be governors
of larger, more strategic provinces. Military commands were established to
oversee relations among the governors. Although Giao was divided into six
provinces, the Red River plain remained intact; it was the dominant province
in the region and was assigned to a nephew of the emperor. Ly Bi was appointed
as military overseer of a province in the plain of the Ca River, on the southern
frontier. From there, he mobilized an army that marched north. Reaching the
Red River, he joined forces with a prominent local clan leader in the Red River
plain named Trieu Tuc. In541, the Liang governor paid a bribe to be allowed to
escape north.
It took the Liang court four years, amidst several false starts, to organize an
expedition against Ly Bi. During this time, while successfully resisting attacks
both from Liang in the north and from Chams in the south, Ly Bi proclaimed
himself an emperor and set about organizing an imperial court, directly challen-
ging Liang’s dynastic claim to the empire. It is no coincidence that the man who
led an army against Ly Bi in545, Chen Baxian, had imperial ambitions of his
own and eventually supplanted the Liang by founding his own dynasty. Chen
Baxian was among the best military commanders of his generation. Within a year
he had driven Ly Bi into the mountains where he was killed by uplanders seeking
to ingratiate themselves with the Liang army. Thereafter, Chen Baxian returned
north where he was absorbed in the wars that eventually led to his proclaiming
the Chen dynasty in557.
Meanwhile, Liang forces remaining in Giao were sidelined by a struggle
between the Ly clan, led by a kinsman of Ly Bi named Ly Phat Tu, who
marshaled his forces in the southern provinces and along the upland frontier,

and the Trieu clan, led by a son of Trieu Tuc named Trieu Quang Phuc, based in
the lowlands of the Red River plain. In557, when the Liang dynasty fell, the Ly
and the Trieu, after many battles, made a truce, each recognizing the other’s
control in their respective territories. This truce was arranged with an eye on the
new Chen dynasty, whose emperor had direct personal experience of Giao,
having vanquished Ly Bi a decade earlier.
In 570, after stabilizing imperial control over the provinces just north of Giao,
Chen Baxian sent an expedition to Giao, the main effect of which appears to
have been the establishment of trading relations and the demise of Trieu Quang
Phuc. This was the end of the brief moment of Chen power on the southern
frontier and subsequently for three decades Ly Phat Tu governed Giao while
watching the new imperial regime of Sui rise in northern China. By the590s, Sui
armies were operating in southern China near the Giao border and Ly Phat Tu
found it expedient to formally acknowledge the authority of Sui officials head-
quartered there.
In the sixth century, the Ly clan found scope for its ambition as imperial power
ebbed from Giao. The Ly took on the trappings of an imperial court and, in the
turmoil of the time, may have nurtured visions of glory beyond Giao’s northern
border. Less is known about the Trieu, but Trieu Quang Phuc’s rise and fall were
recorded in temples dedicated to his memory with a version of the story recorded
in imperial texts about the rise and fall of King An Duong in antiquity, described
earlier in this chapter. This sixth-century version explains how Ly Phat Tu
defeated Trieu Quang Phuc. It associates these men with Sinic lore about frontier
heroes that celebrated loyalty to one’s father over romantic attachment to a
spouse. It is a clichéd tale that had been recycled through the writings of imperial
literati, and it shaped how these sixth-century heroes were remembered through
the writing brushes of aspiring local scholars such as Tinh Thieu.
The rule of Ly Phat Tu, literally“The Son of Buddha with the Ly Surname,”
was congenial to the prosperity of Buddhism. The first Sui emperor reportedly
asked about Buddhism in Giao and was informed by a prominent monk that in
the provincial capital of Giao there were twenty Buddhist temples and five
hundred ordained monks. Sutras had been translated there and prominent
monks were teaching. The first Thien (Chinese Chan; Japanese Zen; Korean
Seon) master was considered to have arrived in Giao at this time, initiating a
lineage of patriarchs in the School of Dhyana (meditation), which was beginning
to flourish at that time.
As Sui inaugurated a new imperial era in the north, a residue of resisters and
adventurers from the old order of the Southern Dynasties crowded into Giao,
and Ly Phat Tu presided over the last outpost of a passing age. After years of
equivocating with Sui officials, he was unprepared to resist when, in602, a Sui

army, under the able leadership of an energetic commander named Liu Fang,
unexpectedly emerged from the northern mountains. Ly Phat Tu surrendered
and was taken prisoner to the Sui capital in northern China. Liu Fang took the
submission of local clans while tracking down and executing the few recalci-
trants. To punctuate Sui dominance on the frontier, he then led his army down
the coast to a Cham royal center at Tra Kieu, near modern Da Nang, which he
put to the torch. Loaded with plunder, Liu Fang and his army encountered an
epidemic en route back north and reportedly perished to the last man.
Despite this disaster, Sui officials easily established their rule in Giao.They
brought a new way of organizing society, economy, and government as well as
cultural and educational fashions that superseded the imperial ebbs and flows that
had characterized the preceding four centuries of belonging to the Southern Dynas-
ties. The Sui inaugurated an imperial age that brought fundamental change to Giao.
The Protectorate of An Nam
Less than two decades after having extended its southern frontier to Giao, the Sui
dynasty collapsed in618 and was superseded by the Tang. This transition was
peaceful in Giao as Sui officials transferred their allegiance to the new dynasty. The
Sui and Tang dynasties established a regime based on the success of prior Northern
Dynasties in centralizing their authority against the great families that had dom-
inated the empire since Han times. The basis of this regime was the so-called
“equal field” system of land distribution that limited the amount of land any one
person could own and instituted a periodic redistribution of farmland to individ-
ual taxpayers organized into military units. This ensured a stable source of tax
revenue and of soldiers for the imperial armies. It was most effective in areas that
were newly opened up for agriculture and that did not already have powerful local
families. Accordingly, in the seventh century, for the first time, the imperial
headquarters for Giao was shifted south of the Red River, to the site of modern
Hanoi. This was adjacent to lands in the southern and western parts of the plain
that were prone to flooding from the Red River and where, beginning in the fifth
century, the building of dikes had been making large-scale agriculture increasingly
feasible. The appearance in the seventh century of an administrative center at what
is now Hanoi was related to the organization of peasant-soldier communities
south of the Red River as the foundation of Tang power in the region.
This was a time of peace and prosperity. Giao was a major stop on the land
and sea routes between the Tang Empire and lands beyond. The sea route to
India was well traveled by merchants and by Buddhist monks on pilgrimage.
Fortunes were made from trade in tropical luxury goods. Imperial administrators

garrisoned the upland frontiers and kept an eye on the peoples and markets
there, under orders to enforce an embargo on trade in weapons. Information
from Giao during the first three-quarters of the seventh century includes much
detail about changes in administrative jurisdictions, culminating in679 with the
formation of the Protectorate of An Nam (“pacified south”), a kind of Tang
jurisdiction that combined civil and military authority in the hands of a protector
general that was considered appropriate for an exposed border region.
Tang records reveal concern about building walls and ramparts in the Hanoi
area. During the three centuries of Tang rule these walls were repeatedly
repaired, rebuilt, and expanded, and the place was known by several different
names, most of them referring to particular kinds of wall. When the city was
rebuilt near the end of the eighth century after a destructive war, it became
known as Dai La,“big wall,” the name that will be used in this chapter for the
sake of convenience. This was where administrators organized a peasant militia
based on the“equal field” system.
There is only one report of political violence in the seventh century, and it
reveals the presence of a large peasant militia in the Dai La area. In687, a new
and inexperienced protector general endeavored to double the rate of the harvest
tax, provoking an uprising that besieged him within the walls of Dai La. Before
Tang forces could be effectively mobilized from the north, the walls were
breached and the protector general was killed. This episode shows that the
peasants affected by harvest taxes also held the balance of military force and
were capable of successfully besieging the seat of government. It would be a
mistake to imagine that these rebels represented some kind of non-Chinese
resistance to Tang authority. The rank and file included many local people, but
the hierarchy of command and the specialized skills necessary to organize a siege
of the protectorate headquarters required officers, engineers, and other experts
that included men from the Tang heartland. The issue was not resistance to
imperial government but rather to an inept governor general. The687 uprising
was focused on the administrative center and limited to the region south of the
Red River that the Tang peasant militia had brought under cultivation during the
preceding decades. This is the only recorded domestic unrest during the first two
centuries of Tang rule, and it came from within the Tang system of government
itself, not from supposedly indigenous anti-Tang forces seeking to expel the
imperial regime altogether. For the most part, people in the lowlands accepted
Tang government.
North of the Red River, in the region where the great families of the Han and
the Southern Dynasties had been based, a different socio-economic situation
developed as powerful local families transformed their private estates into temple
estates. Some of their sons entered officialdom and others entered the monastic

communities that presided over the temples. The Buddhist temples across the
river north and east from Dai La flourished during Tang times. The earliest
people to be cited in later works as prominent Buddhist patriarchs date from this
time. In addition to the prominence of Buddhist relics and miracles, which date
from the time of Shi Xie at the turn of the third century, there are indications of a
new emphasis on erudition and the study of sutra texts among Buddhist monks
in An Nam. Also, popular religious cults developed in Tang times to worship
local spirits that protected imperial government.
Some historical events appear with such little context that it is impossible to
evaluate what exactly happened or what significance they might be imagined to
have had. One such event is the great spasm of violence that broke into the
southern Tang frontier in722 under the leadership of a man remembered in
Tang records as the Black Emperor, presumably because he was black. He came
from a coastal village at the extreme southern frontier of the Tang Empire, in
modern Ha Tinh Province, near Ngang Pass at the Hoanh Son massif. This was
not only on the border of Tang with peoples on the southern coast; it was also
near the terminus of the main route from the middle part of the Mekong over the
mountains through Mu Gia Pass to the coast. According to Tang records, the
Black Emperor assembled a host of four hundred thousand, comprised of a
multitude of peoples from the mountains, the coasts, and the seas beyond the
Tang frontier. What led to this breakdown of Tang frontier vigilance is as
mysterious as what may have elicited and enabled the Black Emperor’s leader-
ship. The Black Emperor and his followers marched north and, surprising the
fleeing Tang authorities, soon had the entire Protectorate of An Nam under their
plundering regime. Tang forces in the north immediately mobilized, marched
back into the Protectorate, and slaughtered the Black Emperor and his horde.
Forty-five years later, in 767, a somewhat similar episode occurred when
people identified in Tang records with terms generally applied to the islands of
what is now Indonesia invaded from the sea and briefly overran the Protectorate
of An Nam until armies mobilized in the north arrived to expel them. As in the
case of the Black Emperor, our knowledge of events in Southeast Asia during that
time is insufficient to allow any sense of clarity about what may have provoked
or elicited this event. What bears consideration, however, is that the Protectorate
of An Nam was organized to prevent such threats from materializing or to
respond to them when they did. The fact that during the course of two centuries
there occurred only two such episodes of frontier security being breached, and
that in each case a successful Tang response was organized with alacrity, shows
the stability of Tang authority during that time.
During the last half of the eighth century, the Tang Empire was greatly
weakened by a series of rebellions led by commanders of the peasant-soldier

armies that had been the basis for the rise of the dynasty. These rebellions came
on the heels of serious defeats in the early750s suffered by Tang armies in
Yunnan, in Central Asia, and in Manchuria. In the late750s and760s, military
units were withdrawn from An Nam to fight against the rebellious generals in
northern China. News of this may have encouraged the767 seaborne invasion
mentioned above.
By the 770s and 780s, Tang government in An Nam gave way to military
commanders vying for ascendancy. Some of these men were of local origin. Tang
records identified one of them, named Phung Hung, as a“frontier garrison
indigenous leader.” He came from the region of old Me Linh, associated with
the Trung Sisters and pre-Han traditions. According to local lore, he was from a
prominent family and claimed an indigenous rather than an imperial title.
Phung Hung gained control of An Nam sometime in the mid780s as Tang
authority faded from the southern frontier amidst the fighting among contenders
in northern China. It is recorded that he peacefully entered Dai La after the death
of a protector general. When Phung Hung died in789 there was a struggle in the
Phung family between partisans of his brother and of his son. Those in favor of
his son prevailed. Phung Hung’s son reportedly honored him with a posthumous
title that contains the earliest known use of what became the Vietnamese word
for king (vua), which is generally considered to be related to another Vietnamese
word for father (bo), and which some have also conjectured to be related to a
word in the Tai languages of Southeast Asia that means chieftain.
By this time, the rebellions in the north had been put down and the Tang
Empire was regaining a measure of stability. In791 a newly appointed protector
general appeared and the Phung family submitted peacefully. The brief ascend-
ancy of the Phung family was a local response to a temporary withering away of
imperial government in An Nam, an effort by local powers to maintain a
semblance of political order in a time of dynastic emergency in the north. Tang
government in An Nam was fundamentally stable. This is evident considering
that it held together for thirty years after the outbreak of rebellions in the north,
and when it was reconstituted in the790s the local people readily acknowledged
it without resistance.
The Nan Zhao War
The reconstituted Tang Empire that emerged in the late eighth century was based
on a social and economic foundation that once again facilitated the rise of great
families. The“equal field” system was abandoned and restrictions on land
ownership were abolished. Taxation was shifted from a per capita enumeration

to calculations based on cultivated land. Wealthy local families came to occupy
prominent administrative positions. Over the course of several decades, this led
to increasing dissention within An Nam between leaders from Giao in the Red
River plain who supported Tang authority and leaders from peripheral upland
areas and in the southern provinces who were driven by other ambitions. What
gave momentum to this developing confrontation was not only the rise of
contending local powers but also the progressive weakening of Tang central
government during the course of the ninth century. This was accompanied by
the rise of new threats from beyond the frontiers. The peoples in the mountains
were being stirred by the rise of the Nan Zhao kingdom in Yunnan, and on the
southern coast the Chams were resurgent.
After the Phung Hung episode, Tang government in An Nam benefited from a
series of astute protector generals who cultivated popular support for rebuilding
government in the protectorate. The first of these, Zhao Chang, wrote a book
about An Nam and earned a good reputation among the people in the Red River
plain. He was in An Nam from791 to 802 and was sent back a second time from
804 to 806. His protégé, Zhang Zhou, succeeded him from806 to 810 and
during that time organized an army to beat back the Chams who, during the time
Zhao Chang had been absent from the protectorate, had seized the southern
coastal provinces in alliance with local leaders there.
However, the situation turned grim in820 when a military commander, whose
ancestors had been administrators on the Cham frontier since the early eighth
century, managed to seize Dai La and to kill the protector general along with a
thousand members of his entourage. For the next sixteen years, the protectorate
was rent with disorders; imperial officials struggled with local strongmen and
frontier threats. The situation eased somewhat in the late830s with the leader-
ship of some capable protector generals, only to worsen again in the late840s
and early850s as protectorate politics were superseded by the ascendance of Nan
Zhao and its mobilization of peoples in the mountains for a policy of raiding and
plundering the lowlands of An Nam.
Despite the chronic raiding, trade in horses and salt continued between people
in the uplands and lowlands. In854, a seemingly inept protector general’s effort
to gain control of this trade led to its breakdown and an escalation of hostilities.
Do Ton Thanh, the governor of the Ma River plain, whose family had been
prominent in the region since the fifth century, allied with Nan Zhao, whether in
resistance to the protector general or in response to spreading disorder is unclear;
he was seized and executed by the protector general, which stiffened resistance to
Tang authority in the southern parts of the protectorate. Then, the protector
general neglected, whether by bungling, by the manipulations of local officials, or
by lack of resources is unclear, to reinforce the garrison at the head of the Red

River plain during the dry season when raiders habitually burst from the moun-
tains. The commander of the garrison, caught in a hopeless situation, shifted his
allegiance to Nan Zhao.
Such are the main events cited in historical records for the outbreak of a war
that devastated An Nam during the next decade. Imperial historiography
assigned blame for this war to the hapless protector general at that time, a
shadowy figure named Li Zhuo, of whom virtually no information has survived.
While a more capable man may have been able to master the situation, this war
was about much more than one man’s mistakes. It had been brewing for decades.
Not simply a problem of frontier security, it had to do with local politics in the
protectorate and how to respond to the decline in Tang power.
The people of An Nam experienced imperial rule differently, depending upon
terrain and upon proximity to centers of government. Agriculturalists in the Red
River plain were most directly affected by Sinic civilization. They understood
themselves as members of the civilized world that relied upon the Tang shield for
protection against the barbaric forces of disorder that threatened them. The
inhabitants of provinces in the southern plains of the Ma and Ca Rivers were
vulnerable to and less hostile toward neighboring peoples in the mountains and
on the southern coast who lived beyond the imperial order; they could relate to
these peoples as potential allies in times when northern dynastic power was too
weak to maintain order in their lands.
The rising prestige of Nan Zhao, combined with the ebbing of Tang strength
on the southern frontier, posed a problem for leaders in the southern provinces.
They considered that it was time to take affairs into their own hands. Nan Zhao
was breaking Tang’s grip on the region, but they aspired to be the ones who
would benefit by eventually extending their power over the population of the
Red River plain. Nan Zhao, with its center far away through the mountains in
Yunnan, could plunder the lowlands and destabilize the imperial regime, but it
was not capable of governing the agriculturalists of An Nam, which was the
ambition of leaders in the southern provinces. Thus, we see in this war a theme
that would reappear more than once during the course of later Vietnamese
history: competition for dominance between the provinces in the Red River plain
and the provinces in the plains of the Ma and Ca Rivers.
After the collapse of the Red River border garrison in854, Tang armies were
mobilized into An Nam, but turmoil in neighboring jurisdictions to the north
distracted Tang attention. By858, a local military commander, of whom nothing
is known, had pushed aside the protector general. But shortly after, a competent
general from the north arrived with Tang reinforcements, and, for two years,
until his departure, he built new fortifications to protect Dai La, prevented Nan
Zhao forces from entering the lowlands, and restored stable administration

among the agriculturalists in the Red River plain. However, in861, within a year
of his departure, the family of Do Ton Thanh, the southern governor whom Li
Zhuo had executed in854 for negotiating with Nan Zhao, mobilized an army in
league with Nan Zhao and captured Dai La while Tang forces were tied down in
the mountains further north. Tang reinforcements soon arrived and restored a
semblance of order as imperial officials endeavored to calm the protectorate by
placating the Do family with apologies for Do Ton Thanh’s death.
This policy of conciliation failed, however, as the Tang weakness it was meant
to conceal was unmasked by a full-scale Nan Zhao invasion in early862. Tang
armies fought until early 863, when Dai La fell and large numbers of Tang
soldiers drowned trying to escape across the Red River. Tang forces in An
Nam were utterly defeated. Nan Zhao plundered the Red River plain without
hindrance as a multitude of refugees fled north and tens of thousands of perished
soldiers were mourned in the towns and villages of central China where they had
been recruited, provoking one Mencian scholar at the Tang court to write a song
blaming the disaster on bad government and criticizing the empire’s waste of
human life, thereby knowingly ruining his own career in officialdom.
It took two years for Tang to organize a military response to the defeat of863.
The population of An Nam was scattered by marauding bands from the moun-
tains, and a large refugee population accumulated just over the northern border
where Tang armies assembled. Men from the southern provinces of the protect-
orate occupied the administrative center at Dai Lai and allied with Nan Zhao,
preparing to resist the expected Tang reaction. The Tang court considered the
situation sufficiently dire as to require the skills of Gao Pian, one of the most
famous generals in the empire, who had made his reputation fighting Turks on
the northern frontier. In865, after months of training and preparing his troops,
he advanced into the protectorate, chased Nan Zhao contingents into the moun-
tains, and besieged recalcitrant forces at Dai La, which he took by the end of the
year, reportedly executing some thirty thousand men captured there.
The Tang Empire’s remarkable effort to recover An Nam at a time when
imperial authority was moving rapidly toward a general collapse is an indication
not only of the primacy of frontier security but also of how An Nam was
considered an integral part of the dynastic inheritance. Young men from An
Nam took the official examinations and served in officialdom all over the empire.
One of them rose to be prime minister in the late eighth century and two of his
essays have been preserved. Another wrote a poem that was collected by Tang
anthologists. One governor general of An Nam, despite being forced to flee the
protectorate by a mutiny in the840s, felt so at home there that he later retired to
a village east of Hanoi, thereby establishing a family that in later centuries
produced many famous scholars at Vietnamese royal courts.

Gao Pian was himself quite taken with An Nam. He spent three years there
before being called north to deal with more urgent problems. During that time,
he supervised emergency shipments of food for the population. He rebuilt Dai
La, restored and extended dikes and canals, and constructed roads, bridges, and
public inns. He also removed rocks that impeded coastal shipping, researched
geomantic features of the terrain, investigated existing popular spirit cults,
patronized shrines and temples, and instigated the worship of new deities to
buttress An Nam’s connection to the imperial supernatural realm. Furthermore,
he wrote poems about An Nam propounding Confucian and Daoist ideas. Later
Vietnamese scholars credited him with authoring the first book on local geog-
raphy and several maps and geographical texts were subsequently attributed to
him. Popular tales of his deeds entered Vietnamese lore and Vietnamese literati
sang his praises into the nineteenth century. He was the hero of the people in the
Red River plain, for he had restored to them their membership of the civilized
world. In the early eleventh century, a ruler from the Red River plain explicitly
cited his legacy for inspirational authority after wresting power from a regime
based in the southern provinces.
When Gao Pian departed An Nam in 868, he left in charge one of his
grandsons, Kao Xun, of whom nothing is known. In the 870s, Zeng Gun
replaced Kao Xun. Zeng Gun had been Gao Pian’s most trusted assistant during
the Nan Zhao War and remained in An Nam for fifteen years. He wrote a book
about the Red River plain that no longer exists but was cited by Vietnamese
scholars in later centuries. In880, he left when the last Tang garrisons were
withdrawn amidst spreading anarchy in the north. Thereafter, the people of the
Red River plain were left to their own devices as a host of warlords began to
carve up the empire. For the next half-century, a relatively stable and peaceful
regime was led by the Khuc family. As for the southern provinces, Gao Pian had
halted their separate political trajectory and subordinated them to the structure
of power based in the Red River plain.
A lesser empire
The Khuc were a prominent family from the old heartland of Giao Province, east
of Hanoi. When the Tang dynasty was officially replaced by the Later Liang
dynasty in907, the leader of this family was Khuc Thua My. He transferred his
allegiance from Tang to Later Liang and claimed legitimacy as a loyal imperial
official. The Later Liang exerted little influence beyond northern China, but, as
late as918, Khuc Thua My continued to send envoys with tribute to Later Liang
to maintain the benefit of whatever moral support could be obtained from

imperial appointments. In central and southern China, adventurers were striving
to expand their authority with dreams of founding their own dynasties. In917,
one such aspirant proclaimed the Southern Han dynasty in Guangdong and
Guangxi, on the northern border of Giao. When Later Liang fell in923, the
powers contending for northern China gave no more thought to affairs in the
south, and Southern Han began to nurture designs on An Nam.
The Khuc did not follow the model of other regional powers in China by founding
a dynasty. They continued to pose as officials of an empire that no longer existed,
ostensibly waiting for a new imperial house to re-establish order in the north. Unlike
other parts of the empire that since the late ninth century had been ravaged by the
uprisings and turmoil of Tang’s long decline, An Nam rested quietly with the legacy
of fifteen years of stable government led by Gao Pian, by his grandson, and byZeng
Gun. The men who inherited this legacy shrank from the anarchic violence they
observed in the north. Claiming to be more than imperial servants would simply
attract unwanted attention and stoke the ambitions of their Southern Han neighbor.
For several years, they had an alliance with the Min kingdom of Fujian, located on
the northeastern border of Southern Han, which discouraged Southern Han from
launching an attack on either of them. However, when Min fell apart into civil war
in 930, Southern Han immediately took the opportunity to attack An Nam.
There is no record of any resistance being offered by Khuc Thua My. It
appears that he and his advisors considered it best to submit. After all, their
sense of identity was with the empire, and the Southern Han were claimants to
the imperial throne. Khuc Thua My was taken into custody and removed to the
north where he spent the rest of his life. The Southern Han army could not resist
the temptation to march down the coast to sack the Cham capital at Tra Kieu.
After that, Southern Han was content to appoint a governor of Giao Province
with responsibility for the Red River plain.
The southern provinces, in the Ma and Ca River plains, were left in the hands
of a subordinate of Khuc Thua My, a man native to that region named Duong
Dinh Nghe. While the people in the Red River plain may have been relatively
phlegmatic about Southern Han rule, Duong Dinh Nghe and the people who
assembled around him had their own ambitions. In931, Duong Dinh Nghe
marched his soldiers north to Dai La, expelled the Southern Han officials with
their garrison, and attacked the Southern Han army that was sent as reinforce-
ment, killing its general in battle. He then proclaimed himself to be the governor,
and Southern Han, stinging from defeat and unprepared for further fighting,
recognized him as such.
Duong Dinh Nghe’s mobilization of the southern provinces was the first
indication after the Nan Zhao War that these territories were prepared to re-
enter the competition for control of the Red River plain. There were two main

political centers in the plain, Giao in the agricultural heartland with Da Lai at its
center and Phong, formerly Me Linh, at the head of the plain where the Red
River emerges from the mountains. For centuries, the headquarters for patrolling
the upland hinterland had been located in Phong. Duong Dinh Nghe endeavored
to rule from Da Lai, but, in937, Kieu Cong Tien, a leader of Phong, killed him
and called on Southern Han for assistance against the southern provinces. In
response, Southern Han mobilized a fleet of warships, commanded by the crown
prince, to bring an army to the aid of its would-be ally in Phong.
Meanwhile, Duong Dinh Nghe’s son-in-law, Ngo Quyen, also from Phong but
in command of the southern provinces, marched north and killed Kieu Cong
Tien. He then stationed his men at the estuary of the Bach Dang River where the
sea routes entered the plain and where he prepared to receive the Southern Han
fleet with iron-tipped poles planted in the bed of the river. When the Southern
Han fleet arrived in late938, it was trapped on the poles as the tide fell and was
annihilated; the heir to the Southern Han throne perished, and that was the end
of Southern Han ambitions in An Nam.
What was left of the empire was now divided up among several regional king-
doms and it was no longer plausible to maintain the fiction of posing as an
administrator-in-waiting for some new dynasty to restore the imperial peace. Ngo
Quyen accordingly rode the momentum of his battlefield victory at the Bach Dang
estuary and took the step of entering the realm of jostling post-Tang states by
claiming royal status and proposing to found a dynasty of his own. He organized
a court with titles, ritual etiquette, and dress code modeled on imitations of imperial
practice then current at the various regional capitals in the north. Furthermore, he
set his capital north of the Red River at the ancient site of Co Loa, the fortress
supposedly built by King An Duong over a millennium before, located in the
heartland of old pre-Tang Giao where the Chinese-speaking population was
concentrated.
Ngo Quyen’s adoption of the forms of imperial authority at a site north of the
Red River shows that, although he had avenged his father-in-law by killing the
leader of Phong, he had also come to terms with the people of Giao. Preparing
for the Battle of Bach Dang had required the active assistance of these people, for
the Bach Dang estuary was in eastern Giao. Despite his career in Duong Dinh
Nghe’s entourage and his command of the southern provinces, he was as noted
earlier originally from Phong, the same district that had produced Phung Hung in
the eighth century, whose posthumous cult he patronized. He achieved an
alliance between the southern provinces and the Red River plain. The court at
Co Loa was designed to elicit the loyalty of prominent people who believed in
maintaining membership in the northern political realm, whatever form that
might take.

When Ngo Quyen died in944, Duong Tam Kha, his brother-in-law and a son
of Duong Dinh Nghe, proclaimed himself king. The eldest of Ngo Quyen’s sons,
not yet an adult, fled and was protected by a powerful family in eastern Giao.
Duong Tam Kha brought people from the southern provinces into the court and
pushed aside the men of Giao. In950, leaders in Giao rallied behind Ngo
Quyen’s second son, who had remained under Duong Tam Kha’s tutelage, and
deposed Duong Tam Kha, banishing him south of the Red River. At this point,
men from the southern provinces were pushed out of the royal court and the
powerful families of Giao stood behind Ngo Quyen’s two eldest sons, who
presided over a weak two-headed monarchy. When the eldest brother died in
954, the younger brother announced himself as a vassal of Southern Han, but
this was of no help to him. Enmity between the Kieu and Ngo families produced
chronic fighting between Phong and Giao, and in963 the Ngo king was killed in
an ambush while campaigning on the Giao–Phong border. His successor, very
likely a younger brother, was unable to resist a new leader emerging from the
southern provinces named Dinh Bo Linh, who forced him and the Ngo family
into his entourage with multiple marriage alliances.
Dinh Bo Linh’s father had been in command on the Cham border in the far
south under Duong Dinh Nghe and Ngo Quyen. Dinh Bo Linh was based at Hoa
Lu, a natural redoubt among the rocky outcroppings of the southeastern edge of
the Red River plain in modern Ninh Binh province. Hoa Lu commanded the
main land route from the plain to the southern provinces. It was also an outpost
of the southern provinces looking out upon the Red River plain. From there,
Dinh Bo Linh built up his forces, allied with neighboring strongmen along the
lower Red River, and attacked those in the upper plain who resisted him, the
most valiant of whom were three brothers, sons of a Chinese merchant and a
local woman. He subdued all his opponents by965 when he sent envoys to the
Southern Han court. At this time the empire was being reconstituted by the Song
dynasty, which conquered Southern Han in971.I n973 and again in975, Dinh
Bo Linh sent envoys to establish and then to expand relations with the Song court
in northern China, which, being occupied with urgent problems elsewhere,
provisionally acknowledged the Dinh family’s authority in An Nam.
In terms of geographical extent and military power, the Song dynasty did not
compare with the Han and the Tang. The reason for this was that the warrior
aristocracy that for centuries had founded dynasties and ruled the empire had,
beginning in the last half of Tang, been superseded by a class of scholars and
administrators who advanced their careers through a system of academic exam-
inations and were distrustful of military men. Armies were organized with
multiple chains of command to prevent any single person from gaining control
of soldiers. Military campaigns were bureaucratized with pre-set itineraries and

the need for cooperation among men chosen for their personal animosity toward
each other. Consequently, the Song dynasty did not expand to the north, the
northwest, and the northeast to the extent that previous major dynasties had, but
instead was blocked by other powers along these borders. As for the southern
frontier, the Song court waited for an opportunity to reclaim the legacy of Han
and Tang. This opportunity came in980 with news that Dinh Bo Linh had been
assassinated and that his followers were fighting among themselves. This came at
a time of relative quiet on the northern frontiers and an expedition was quickly
organized to reclaim the far south.
A courtier who reportedly had visions of grandeur stabbed Dinh Bo Linh and
his eldest son to death in their sleep. A brief struggle for power was quickly
resolved in favor of Le Hoan, a native of the province south of Hoa Lu, now
called Thanh Hoa, who was commander of an army that had been recruited by
Dinh Bo Linh in the Red River plain. Le Hoan prepared to resist the Song
expedition, which was en route both by land and by sea. The leaders of the Song
forces were unimaginative and confounded by strict instructions from the imper-
ial court. The land force arrived on the northern edge of the Red River plain and
spent over two months in camp waiting for the arrival of the fleet, which was
held up by fighting with Le Hoan’s forces at the Bach Dang estuary. When the
fleet arrived, the Song officers argued about what to do next, dismayed by the
loss of time and the approach of the monsoon rain season when warfare was
impracticable. One senior official, believing that Le Hoan was about to submit,
embarked part of the army and advanced by river toward Hoa Lu, but he was
ambushed and killed. News of this led the other senior officers to abandon the
campaign and return north, where they were executed for incompetence.
This war exemplified how the situation had changed from that in previous
centuries. In the past, new dynasties had no problem establishing their control
over the plains of the Red, Ma, and Ca Rivers. The generals who led imperial
armies adapted to circumstances and improvised their strategies, taking calcu-
lated risks, being confident of victory. In980, the Song army came with a
committee of arguing officers constrained by their instructions and fearful of
defeat. This was a new kind of empire led by a different kind of people. It lacked
the martial prowess and strategic vision of the old Han-Tang aristocracy. Rather,
it was focused on civil administration, bureaucratic procedure, the management
of wealth, and literary excellence.
In the wake of the Song expedition’s withdrawal in 981, Le Hoan moved
quickly to establish relations with the northern empire. Hoa Lu diplomacy had
initiated a precedent during the previous ten years. After the Song conquest of
southern China in971, Dinh Lien, Dinh Bo Linh’s son, had traveled to the Song
court and obtained an imperial appointment as governor; during the 970s,

envoys from Hoa Lu bearing rich tribute repeatedly went to the Song court and
Song envoys arrived at Hoa Lu to confer additional honorary titles on both Dinh
Lien and Dinh Bo Linh. After the uproar of980–981, Le Hoan initially con-
ducted diplomacy with Song in the name of the last Dinh king, an infant son of
Dinh Bo Linh whom he had deposed and adopted when taking the throne. When
it became clear that Song was uninterested in further warfare and, moreover, was
open to conciliation, Le Hoan stepped from the shadows and informed Song that
he had supplanted the Dinh. The Song court responded in986 by recognizing
him as the local ruler and conferring on him titles of vassalage. Throughout Le
Hoan’s reign, envoys from Hoa Lu regularly carried tribute to the Song court
and Song envoys arrived to bestow further titles on Le Hoan. One Song envoy, Li
Jiao, became famous for exchanging poetry with the Buddhist monks assigned to
greet and entertain him. In modern times, the verse produced in these exchanges
has been anthologized as the first poems in what is imagined to be the history of
Vietnamese literature.
In the mid990s, when Le Hoan was beginning to enforce his ascendancy in
areas adjacent to the Song border, the emperor accused him of plundering Song
settlements both by land and by sea. Le Hoan replied that the depredations were
the work of rebels and bandits whom he was endeavoring to suppress. The Song
court, determined on a pacifist policy, accepted his explanation and amicable
relations were soon restored. Many men at the Song court began to understand
that the imperial inheritance on the southern frontier, as on the northern frontier,
was beyond their capacity to reclaim. Le Hoan understood that the Song would
leave him alone so long as he observed the protocol of vassalage and displayed a
respectful attitude.
The millennium of belonging to the empire ended because of fundamental
changes in the outlook of the rulers of the empire and in how imperial govern-
ment was organized. What for centuries had been Giao Province or the Protect-
orate of An Nam was now beyond the reach of imperial armies because, in
comparison with earlier times, military commanders were kept on a short bur-
eaucratic leash. But this was also more than just an administrative matter. Song
rulers were less cosmopolitan than those of Han and Tang; their relative weak-
ness in relation to neighboring powers produced a more embattled perception of
the civilized world, narrower and less confident of being able to accommodate
cultural diversity. While earlier dynasties had no problem accepting the people of
Giao/An Nam as more or less legitimate members of the empire, Song rulers
viewed them as beyond the edge of civilization. This was revealed in the imperial
edict published in980 announcing the reasons for the expedition against Hoa
Lu. The rhetoric of disdain for and outrage at the uncivilized behavior of Le
Hoan and the people he ruled was unprecedented in the long history of official

imperial relations with this part of the world. Beyond giving lip service to the
historical task of reclaiming a part of the imperial inheritance, this edict dilated
upon the task of eradicating savagery, indicating a more constricted mental
world than that of previous generations of imperial officials who had lived,
worked, and permanently settled in Giao/An Nam.
The Song attitude effectively redefined this place as outside the realm of
civilization. Le Hoan was able to go his separate way not only because Song
was not strong enough to subdue him but also because Song no longer con-
sidered him and the people he ruled sufficiently civilized to be deemed proper
subjects of the empire. Song’s diminished martial prowess was closely related to
this more demanding, less inclusive, view of the civilized world because men in
government were now products of literary education and civil administration
more than of military training and battlefield experience. One effect of this
fundamental change in Chinese government was that the people in the Red River
plain began a new trajectory of cultural and political autonomy.
Every aspect of Vietnamese culture is deeply imprinted by contact with China.
To assume that these aspects have been either imposed by imperial oppressors or
freely borrowed by indigenous people requires a clear demarcation between what
is called Chinese and what is called Vietnamese. Such a demarcation did not exist
during the time we have discussed in this chapter. In the tenth century, the people
of what is now northern Vietnam were an amalgam of settlers from the north
and indigenous peoples; for centuries they had lived together, intermarried,
developed bilingual habits of speech, and formed a regional perspective on
imperial civilization.
By the end of the tenth century, as described in the Introduction, the version of
the Chinese language spoken in northern Vietnam, which we can call Annamese
Middle Chinese, was cut off from regular contact with the north and from fresh
infusions of Chinese speakers. It nevertheless remained the prestige language
even as it became more isolated in the region surrounding Hanoi and began a
process of merging with and shifting into the prestige version of Proto-Viet-
Muong, a process that produced what we can recognize as the Vietnamese
language.

2 THE LY DYNASTY
Hoa Lu
During the forty years that Dinh Bo Linh and Le Hoan ruled from Hoa Lu (965–
1005), possibilities for rustic leaders from the southern provinces to govern the
more populous Red River plain with its temples, schools, and heritage of imperial
culture were fully explored and ultimately reached their limit. However, before
this line of events had run its course, Le Hoan’s reliance upon a new class of
leaders from Giao opened the way for an exit from this impasse. Le Hoan’s
quarter-century reign reveals both his astuteness in solving immediate problems
and his failure to establish a basis for long-term political stability.
Events of the tenth century were narrated in the previous chapter in the context
of a progressive disengagement from the imperial world. When viewed from the
perspective of local politics, these events become a story about relations between
the population of the Red River plain and the population of the southern prov-
inces. These provinces have been differently organized and named through the
centuries. They comprise the modern provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ha
Tinh. Ha Tinh was separated from Nghe An only in recent times. For centuries, the
basin of the Ma and Chu Rivers was Thanh Hoa and the basin of the Ca River was
Nghe An. The uplands of Thanh Hoa communicate with the region of Sam Neua
in the modern Laotian province of Houaphan. The uplands of Nghe An communi-
cate with the modern Laotian province of Xieng Khouang, a region known in
Western languages as the Plain of Jars and which the Vietnamese call the Tran
Ninh plateau. These uplands were a borderland between Tai and Vietic peoples.
In the tenth century, the Red River plain was composed of three major
politically defined areas. The heart of the plain was Giao, centered on a region
bounded by the modern cities of Hanoi, Bac Ninh, Hai Duong, and Hung Yen.
In the northwest was Phong, old Me Linh, where the Red River emerged from the
mountains in the modern provinces of Son Tay and Vinh Phu. In the southwest

was Truong, the region of Hoa Lu in modern Ninh Binh province, on the border
of Thanh Hoa. Leaders in Phong drew upon the resources of the upland valleys
inhabited by Tai-speaking peoples. In Truong, Hoa Lu drew upon the resources
of the southern provinces. Giao contained the greatest residue from the imperial
experience and leaders there vacillated between pursuing local experiments and
looking north for alliances and political ideas.
The men who stood at the head of politics in the tenth century lived amidst
shifting contexts, which, in the absence of an imperial regime, tested the unity of
An Nam while at the same time opened the way for new kinds of leadership.
Khuc Thua My was from eastern Giao, a man loyal to the empire who preferred
to submit to a northern regional power than to resort to war. He perceived no
vital benefit in fighting for local autonomy. However, Duong Dinh Nghe, from
Thanh Hoa, was prepared to fight for local autonomy but did not aspire to more
than that, resting content with being acknowledged by the neighboring northern
power as the local governor. But this also meant subordination of the Red River
plain to men from the southern provinces. Men of the Red River plain resisted
this, and, after only six years, the leader of Phong killed Duong Dinh Nghe and
made a bid to restore a closer political connection with the north. Ngo Quyen
mobilized an alliance among warriors both from the southern provinces and
from Giao to bring this scheme to naught at the Bach Dang estuary in938.H e
then established a royal court in the mode of the so-called“ten kingdoms” that
then ruled various regions in what had been the Tang Empire.
Ngo Quyen died at the age of46, before he had time to stabilize his accom-
plishment. His entourage splintered under the pressure of regional tensions, with
men from Giao supporting his young sons against his brother-in-law, Duong
Tam Kha, the son and heir of Duong Dinh Nghe, who stood at the head of men
from the southern provinces. Proliferating ambitions inhibited unity even within
the Red River plain with warfare breaking out between the deltaic plains of Giao,
led by Ngo Quyen’s heirs, and the region of Phong where the Red River issues
from the mountains. Then, within fifteen years of Duong Tam Kha being pushed
aside by leaders in Giao, the southern provinces were resurgent under the
leadership of Dinh Bo Linh.
One feature of politics at that time is the extent to which it was related to
personal and family relations. Duong Dinh Nghe was a retainer of Khuc Thua
My, and Ngo Quyen was a son-in-law of Duong Dinh Nghe. Dinh Bo Linh
reportedly began his political career by fighting battles with his paternal uncle
over the leadership of the southern provinces, where his father had governed in
the time of Duong Dinh Nghe and Ngo Quyen. This brings to mind the struggle
between Phung Hung’s brother and son in the late eighth century, a contest
between lateral succession among brothers and patrilineal, or father to son,

succession; such rivalry between uncle and nephew, also apparent in the case of
Duong Tam Kha and the sons of Ngo Quyen, was not characteristic behavior in
Giao, where a large Chinese-speaking population, isolated from regular contact
with the north, began to shift from bilingualism to developing a high-register
version of the local vernacular. This population tended toward the practice of
strict patrilineal succession; on the other hand, brother-to-brother succession was
apparently more plausible among the inhabitants of the southern provinces at
that time.
After he had forced the submission of the Ngo clan in the960s, Dinh Bo Linh
endeavored to bind the Ngo to his family through marriage. He married one of
his daughters to the last Ngo king; he married a younger sister of that king to his
eldest son; and he took the Ngo queen mother as one of his wives. His practice of
marrying prominent women from other powerful families established a tradition
of multiple queens that was followed by his successors for a century. However,
marriage politics were not always effective. The last Ngo king repudiated his
Dinh wife and fled south to the Chams. When he heard of Dinh Bo Linh’s death,
he persuaded the Cham ruler to launch a seaborne attack on Hoa Lu, though the
fleet was destroyed by a typhoon.
Hoa Lu was rustic, but some quasi-Buddhist ideas related to exorcising
demons and to karmic retribution were apparently current at Dinh Bo Linh’s
court. Dinh Bo Linh’s eldest son and designated heir, Dinh Lien, erected one
hundred stone columns inscribed with the Ratnaketu Dharani, a Buddhist text
that is thought to expel demonic powers. In early979, Dinh Bo Linh demoted
Dinh Lien and replaced him as heir with an infant son. According to the annals,
he did this out of extreme love for the infant’s mother. Unwilling to accept this,
Dinh Lien slew the small boy, then erected several stone columns inscribed with
the Usnisa Vijaya Dharani Sutra, believed to provide deliverance from the
consequences of one’s evil deeds, ostensibly seeking to spare his dead brother’s
soul from the torments of hell. The columns bear an inscription explaining that it
was necessary for Dinh Lien to“bring doom to the life” of his brother because
his brother had “strayed from the path of loyalty and filial piety toward his
father and elder brother.” Here was the creative use of a Buddhist sutra to shift
the karmic force of fratricide from the murderer to the victim.
Within a few months of this, Dinh Bo Linh and Dinh Lien were slain by a
courtier as they slept off their drunkenness in a palace courtyard. The assassin,
reportedly mesmerized by portents indicating his own elevation to the throne,
was quickly seized, killed, and, in an unusual case of cannibalism, eaten. Not
much is known about Dinh family politics, but behind these events probably lay
a struggle among the maternal clans of Dinh Bo Linh’s sons, and possibly even Le
Hoan’s design, for the mother of the only surviving son of Dinh Bo Linh was

Duong Van Nga, who was believed to have been intimate with Le Hoan even
before Dinh Bo Linh’s death.
The fighting that immediately broke out between Le Hoan and a group of
rivals after the deaths of the Dinh father and son was reportedly provoked by an
expectation that Le Hoan would take advantage of the king’s youth and of his
relationship with the queen mother to seize the throne for himself. The queen
mother reportedly encouraged Le Hoan to attack his enemies. It was this fighting
that stimulated Song expectations of a successful intervention.
The role of men from Giao in the accession of Le Hoan is apparent from an
event recorded for early autumn980. News had arrived of the Song expedition’s
approach. A prominent commander of soldiers from Giao, Pham Cu Lang,
together with his subordinate officers crowded into the palace and confronted
the queen mother. Pham Cu Lang argued that his men would not fight for a child
unable to discern their battlefield merit and incompetent to bestow appropriate
rewards for their fighting prowess. He demanded that Le Hoan be made king, for
only then would the army march. Duong Van Nga responded by sending the
royal regalia to Le Hoan.
The Dinh family murders in979 and the emergence as queen mother and
regent of a woman believed to be the lover of Le Hoan can easily be imagined as
the result of plans by men from Giao to replace the volatile leadership of Dinh Bo
Linh and Dinh Lien with the more trusted hand of Le Hoan. An unexpected
consequence was the Song attack, but even this served to bind the fortunes of
Giao and Le Hoan more firmly together. Nevertheless, the situation was not as
simple as this might suggest.
One of the men who had joined the unsuccessful alliance against Le Hoan was
an elder brother of Pham Cu Lang. The brothers were from a powerful family in
eastern Giao; their grandfather and father had served the Ngo family, and they
both served the Dinh at Hoa Lu. When resistance to Le Hoan broke out during
the979–980 dry season, one brother went with each faction, apparently to
ensure that the family would be on the winning side no matter the outcome.
Pham Cu Lang’s brother was one of three leaders in the anti-Le Hoan coalition;
while the other two leaders, both closely associated with the Dinh family, were
killed, it is recorded of Pham Cu Lang’s brother only that he was captured.
Duong Van Nga was remembered in later generations for her prominent role
in passing the throne from her son to Le Hoan. Her son, who at the age of6 had
been king for eight months in979–980, was adopted by Le Hoan and served him
loyally; in 1001, he died at Le Hoan’s side when caught in an ambush while
fighting rebels in Thanh Hoa. Because of her role in effecting royal succession
from the Dinh to the Le and because of her being the queen of the two major Hoa
Lu kings, Duong Van Nga was regarded as a woman of extraordinary power,

which apparently explains why a shrine was eventually built at Hoa Lu to
worship her. In this shrine, her statue was placed between statues of Dinh Bo
Linh and Le Hoan. This was a scandal to later Confucianists, who considered
such a reputation to be immoral. According to later writings, in the fifteenth
century, after the royal court began to adhere to a relatively strict Confucianist
code, an official was sent to Hoa Lu to destroy this shrine and to punish Duong
Van Nga for adultery. The official tied the statue of Duong Van Nga to a rope
and pulled it behind his boat all the way back to the capital at Hanoi, ritually
drowning her for her sin. A popular tale claims that this official died suddenly in
great pain after reaching the capital, thereby paying the price exacted by Duong
Van Nga’s spirit for his disrespect toward her.
The rebels at whose hands Duong Van Nga’s son perished were people against
whom Le Hoan arduously and continuously fought in the later years of his reign.
They were from the southern provinces and neighboring upland areas. This may
seem to be odd considering that Le Hoan was himself a native of Thanh Hoa. As
a boy he had shown sufficient intelligence to be adopted into a prominent family,
which gave him an opportunity to earn the notice of Dinh Bo Linh’s eldest son,
chief assistant, and designated heir Dinh Lien, who brought him into the Dinh
entourage. In the970s, when he was in his30s, he was assigned by Dinh Bo Linh
to command soldiers recruited in Giao as well as to command the palace guard at
Hoa Lu. This shows that Dinh Bo Linh felt safer under the protection of
disciplined soldiers from Giao than with men from the southern provinces,
who were difficult to control. It also shows that Dinh Bo Linh was careful to
place a southerner in command of the Giao military units. After both Dinh Bo
Linh and Dinh Lien were assassinated in979, Le Hoan defeated his rivals with
the Giao army, and it was Giao that supported his taking the throne and that
supplied the wealth and manpower that enabled him to resist the invasion from
Song China in980–981.
In the Song War, and in later diplomatic relations with Song, Le Hoan relied
heavily upon the advice of an erudite Chinese named Hong Xian. When Hong
Xian died in988, Le Hoan began to assign fiefs in Giao to his sons, suggesting
that until then Hong Xian may have held administrative responsibility for Giao.
Le Hoan built his primary base of support in Giao, and he championed the
interests of Giao against the southern provinces. This is very understandable
considering that Giao was the center of agricultural resources, of manpower, of
educated talent, and of expertise in dealing with the northern empire.
After decades of turmoil, from the Southern Han expedition of930 to Dinh Bo
Linh’s conquest in the 960s, political leadership in Giao came to rest in the
Buddhist temples among the monks who administered the extensive lands that
had been donated to or acquired by these temples. A new generation of young

men were educated in the temple schools of Giao, both in the Confucian classics
and in the Buddhist sutras. The monks were indispensable to the Hoa Lu kings
for administering Giao and for dealing with the Song Empire, and these monks
found ways to introduce the most promising of their student protégés into the
Hoa Lu court. Within four years of Le Hoan’s death, one of these young men, Ly
Cong Uan, became the king and shifted the royal court from Hoa Lu to Dai La in
the center of Giao.
About eighty-five kilometers almost directly north of Hoa Lu (one hundred
kilometers by boat) lay Dai La, surrounded by rice fields and at the center of the
riverine communication network uniting the Red River plain. By contrast, Hoa
Lu is a natural fortress of limestone outcroppings at the southern extremity of the
plain; it commands the main land route to the southern provinces. Hoa Lu lies at
the entrance of what resembles an antechamber to the Red River plain, about
twenty square kilometers bounded on three sides by uplands and open to the
plain on the east; this is modern Ninh Binh province. Hoa Lu is about forty
kilometers northwest of the seacoast. It is comprised of two connected natural
antechambers located in a small but impressive massif. Enclosed on three sides by
towering cliffs, brick walls were built across their open sides. In one of the
enclosures the kings kept their personal wealth and family retainers; in the other,
they stationed the soldiers of their principal followers and held court. Dinh Bo
Linh was known for rough justice, boiling malefactors in large cauldrons and
feeding them to caged tigers. However, such resort to cruelty for enforcing
obedience was not attributed to Le Hoan. During the course of his reign, Hoa
Lu became the base for Giao to dominate the southern provinces rather than the
other way around as it initially was under Dinh Bo Linh.
The Cham king, ruling at Tra Kieu near the modern city of Da Nang, was
emboldened by Dinh Bo Linh’s death and by the Song invasion to pursue an
aggressive policy toward Hoa Lu. Enemies of Dinh Bo Linh had assembled at the
Cham court and news of his death entangled the Cham king in their hopes for
revenge. As noted previously, a Cham fleet was lost in a storm when about to
attack Hoa Lu in late979.I n982, after the Cham king detained his envoys, Le
Hoan led an expedition that plundered and destroyed the Cham capital, killing
the king and capturing hundreds of soldiers along with scores of palace women
and even a Buddhist monk from India. A Vietnamese adventurer ruled from the
devastated Cham capital until his death in989, meanwhile fending off soldiers
sent by Le Hoan to capture him. Shortly after his death, a man sent to collect
taxes in the southern provinces instead led them in revolt and petitioned the
Cham king, then ruling at Vijaya near the modern city of Qui Nhon, to accept his
submission and to join him against Hoa Lu. The Cham king refused to embroil
himself in this scheme and Le Hoan led his soldiers south, killing the renegade tax

collector as well as “immeasurable” numbers of this man’s followers in the
southern provinces. In the990s, the Cham king relocated back north at Tra
Kieu, and there was chronic fighting between his soldiers and those of Le Hoan.
Much of Le Hoan’s reign was spent in recruiting armies in Giao and sending
them into the southern provinces to build roads, dig canals, and kill rebels. The
Cham frontier beyond the southern provinces, in the old Han jurisdiction of
Nhat Nam, became a lair for renegades and adventurers from both north and
south; it was patrolled by both Le Hoan and the Cham king but controlled by
neither. Nevertheless, the balance of power was tilting against the Chams. After
the death of the Cham king in999, his successors ruled from Vijaya further south
and never again attempted to rule from Tra Kieu.
Le Hoan’s policy of using soldiers from Giao to discipline the southern
provinces and to establish in them an infrastructure for transport and communi-
cation was the initial step in a long process of bringing people from the Red River
plain into this region and of pushing rebels into the uplands. Many of those who
resisted this process went further south beyond Ngang Pass into the Cham
frontier where they found larger scope for their ambitions and where eventually
they and their descendants would be caught up in the patrols and expeditions of
Le Hoan’s successors during the eleventh century.
Le Hoan acknowledged eleven sons and one adopted son with the rank of
prince. The three eldest, all of similar age, were given titles in989 when they were
6 or 7 years old. While these three remained at the Hoa Lu court, the younger
sons were entitled and assigned fiefs during the years991–995. Being children at
the time, the small princes were served by trusted adults. Eight of the nine
princely fiefs were in Giao and one was in Thanh Hoa. The fiefs of the fourth,
fifth, and sixth sons were the most strategic locations for defending the Giao
heartland: Phong, modern Viet Tri, on the northwest, where the Red River and
its confluents flow out of the mountains; Phu Lan, modern Pha Lai, on the
northeast, where a large fortress guarded the land route to China and access to
four rivers; and Dang, modern Hung Yen, on the south, where watch was kept
over points of coastal access to the Red River. Ambitious men gathered in the
entourages of these three princes. None of the other fiefs offered comparable
prospects as a potential base for promotion in what, as the years went by, was
expected to be a fraternal competition for the throne. Le Dinh, the fifth son,
based at Dang, nearest to Hoa Lu, was best situated to be in the middle of events.
The eldest son and designated crown prince died in1000. Le Dinh, then
15 years old but already a strong personality, pressed his father to make him
the crown prince. Le Hoan was disposed to agree to this but was dissuaded by
advisors who argued that Le Dinh’s full brother, the third son, Le Viet, out-
ranked him in age. In1004, Le Hoan accordingly designated Le Viet to be his

heir while at the same time he promoted Le Dinh, Le Viet, and the second son, Le
Tich, all three, to the same rank equivalent to crown prince. Le Hoan’s death in
the following year, at the age of64, was immediately followed by eight months of
fighting in which Le Tich, Le Viet, Le Dinh, and the ninth son, Le Kinh, were all
involved in ways that surviving information does not reveal, but it is clear that
the primary conflict was between partisans of Le Tich and Le Viet. Le Tich was
eventually defeated. He fled south seeking protection with the Cham king but
was killed near the southern border.
Shortly thereafter, Le Viet was proclaimed king at Hoa Lu. Three days after
that, Le Dinh killed Le Viet. After proclaiming himself king, conferring high rank
upon his mother, and naming four women as his queens, Le Dinh proceeded to
besiege Phu Lan, where Le Kinh had taken refuge with the sixth brother, Le Can.
At the point of starvation, Le Can gave up Le Kinh to be beheaded by Le Dinh in
exchange for being allowed to submit. Le Dinh then moved his army to confront
the fourth brother in Phong, who quickly surrendered. He then completed his
wars of accession by marching into the southern provinces to suppress the people
with whom his father had been fighting for years and who had taken the
opportunity to once again rebel. Le Dinh was19 years old when he became
king. He died four years later, reportedly of hemorrhoids brought on by his
debaucheries. He was the last king to rule from Hoa Lu.
Le Dinh’s short reign was portrayed by later historians according to the Confu-
cian idea of“the last bad king” of a dynasty whose depravity justifies the rise of a
new dynasty. He is said to have delighted in cruelty. Much of his energy was spent
campaigning in the southern provinces and attacking the uplands, in the course of
which he assembled large numbers of prisoners, whom he roasted alive, drowned
in cages, felled from trees, or fed to poisonous snakes. He was known for a nasty
sense of humor. He entertained himself by having a Chinese actor spend several
days dissecting a man to death with“a small dull knife” while making jokes in
response to the man’s screams. He thought it was funny when he used a seated
monk’s head to support a stick of sugar cane he was whittling and seriously
wounded the man when his hand slipped. He cooked and fed cats and lizards to
his court officials and laughed when they vomited. He surrounded himself with
actors and jesters who kept up a constant chatter, making light of all that was said
and twisted the words of officials to make them ludicrous. He slid into a state of
drunkenness and unrestrained self-indulgence. His final days were spent in a prone
position because of his hemorrhoids, which is why later historians gave him the
posthumous title Ngoa Trieu Hoang De,“Emperor who Held Court Lying
Down.” The speed with which he dissipated his youthful vigor may indicate that
the stereotype of a dynasty’s last bad king may in this case not be entirely amiss.
Those eager for him to pass from the scene possibly even encouraged his excessive

behavior. These were the monks from temples in the region just north of the Red
River from Dai La, in modern Bac Ninh province.
Ly Cong Uan
The Le succession wars were the context of Ly Cong Uan’s rise to the throne.
Educated by monks in the heartland of Giao, Ly Cong Uan had a reputation for
both erudition and martial prowess. Born in974, he apparently began his career
at the Hoa Lu court in the990s when entourages formed behind Le Hoan’s sons,
for his eldest son was born at Hoa Lu in1000. When Le Dinh struck down Le
Viet in 1005, Ly Cong Uan was 31 years old and in Le Viet’s entourage.
Everyone present fled the scene except for Ly Cong Uan, who, unafraid, was
said to have cradled Le Viet’s corpse in his arms and wept. Le Dinh reportedly
praised his loyalty and made him commander of the palace guard.
Ly Cong Uan’s seemingly smooth transition from the entourage of Le Viet to
that of Le Dinh may be a tribute to his personal qualities, but it is likely also to be
an indication of the influence exercised by his patrons at court, the monks of
Giao. The advisors who persuaded Le Hoan to give Le Viet precedence over Le
Dinh were unconcerned with the seniority of Le Hoan’s second son, Le Tich.
They were definitely partisans of Le Viet, among whom Ly Cong Uan stood. Ly
Cong Uan was the star protégé of the monks. His reputation for“virtue, mercy,
and magnanimity” resonates with the reputation for“upright humaneness” of
Le Viet, the prince he served, and echoes the lessons of temple teachings. During
Le Hoan’s reign, the influence of the monks grew as the Hoa Lu monarchy
increasingly relied upon the wealth and manpower that they could provide. By
the time of Le Hoan’s death, the position of Ly Cong Uan, and of the monks who
stood behind him, was secure. They were indispensable even to Le Dinh, known
for his“ruthless cruelty,” the most determined and unsavory of Le Hoan’s
brawling, fratricidal teenage sons.
Although families of the mothers of potential kings were often important
factors in royal politics in early times, this was probably not the case with the
mother of Le Viet and Le Dinh, who was from the class of palace servants and
not from a politically prominent family. The phrase in historical texts that
identifies her has been variously recorded and interpreted to mean“beautiful
woman,”“ secondary wife,” or, according to some Vietnamese scholars, even
“uncivilized slave woman,” which has led to a conjecture that she was one of the
Cham palace women seized by Le Hoan in982. It may have been precisely
because of her low status that the monks supported her sons, to avoid compli-
cations arising from the ambitions of already powerful families.

Ly Cong Uan’s family background is no less mysterious than that of the
mother of Le Viet and Le Dinh. According to the court chronicle, he was
conceived when his mother had intercourse with a“divine being” at a temple
in the heartland of Giao and at the age of3 was given for adoption to a man
named Ly Khanh Van, of whom no information has survived. A fourteenth-
century historian wrote that some thought he was from Fujian Province in China
but that this was incorrect. He was educated by Van Hanh, the most eminent
Buddhist patriarch of the time, in the village of Dich Bang, a short distance across
the Red River from Hanoi to the northeast. According to some accounts, Van
Hanh was not only the teacher and patron of Ly Cong Uan but also his father. In
the mid990s, as Le Hoan’s sons were being entitled and their entourages were
being assembled, Ly Cong Uan began to serve at the Hoa Lu court, eventually
rising to a high position of trust at the side of the designated heir to the throne. It
is not clear whether the Ly family was a prominent clan in its own right or a clan
of convenience for the monks into which were adopted the most promising
students from the temples. Van Hanh, just prior to Ly Cong Uan taking the
throne, reportedly asserted that, considering all the families in the realm, the Ly
family was“exceedingly large,” and the expression recorded could even be read
as meaning“the largest.”
Incapacitated by declining health, Le Dinh watched helplessly as the monks of
Giao launched a propaganda campaign that nurtured belief in the inevitability of
Ly Cong Uan becoming king. Poems, riddles, portents, and prophecies pointed to
the demise of the Le family and to Ly Cong Uan taking the throne. Van Hanh’s
intemperate talk in this vein at Hoa Lu made Ly Cong Uan sufficiently nervous
that he ordered a kinsman to escort Van Hanh back to Dich Bang and keep him
quiet there. Le Dinh reportedly sought to have Ly Cong Uan killed, but nothing
was done. Ly Cong Uan commanded the palace guard and enjoyed the support
of the monks, who controlled what at that time passed for public opinion.
Two days after Le Dinh died in late 1009, Ly Cong Uan became king,
reportedly by general acclamation. Within a year, Hoa Lu was abandoned.
The royal court relocated to the site of Dai La. Dai La was known as the city
that the Tang general Gao Pian had built in the860s after the ravages of the Nan
Zhao War. In1010, Ly Cong Uan published an edict explaining why he was
moving his capital to this place. Citing kings who moved their capitals during the
Shang and Zhou dynasties in classical antiquity, the edict compared Hoa Lu
unfavorably to“King Gao’s old capital at Dai La,” which was centrally located
amidst the abundance of a broad plain and which displayed the marks of
geomantic potency. Dai La was only ten kilometers from Dich Bang, where Ly
Cong Uan had been raised and educated by Van Hanh. When Ly Cong Uan’s
boat docked at the new capital, a dragon, symbol of sovereign authority,

reportedly soared above his head; he accordingly renamed the place Thang Long,
“ascending dragon.”
The successive reigns of Ly Cong Uan (1009–1028), of his son Ly Phat Ma
(1028–1054), and of his grandson Ly Nhat Ton (1054–1072) appear in histor-
ical records as an era of soaring power for the kingdom over which the house of
Ly presided. All three kings were learned and capable. They all came to the
throne as adults and ruled during their years of vigor. They were all men of
action who traveled incessantly to personally survey the affairs of their realm.
They were all interested in the problems of government. They presided over six
decades of internal peace and prosperity and of an expansion of royal power
outward from Thang Long that met no effective barrier.
Relations with Song were given high priority. One of Ly Cong Uan’s first acts
was to send envoys to the Song court to report that the Dinh family had lost the
capacity to rule and to ask for recognition. During the disorders following Le
Hoan’s death, Song border officials had argued in favor of military intervention,
but the emperor refused to act and admonished officials to avoid becoming
embroiled in the violent affairs of distant uncivilized people. In1010, Song
recognized Ly Cong Uan without delay, conferring upon him the usual titles of
vassalage. Thereafter, Song maintained a pacifist policy, doing the minimum
necessary to preserve border security, even willing to suffer minor violations.
The aim of Song policy was to preclude any provocation that might arouse a
major crisis requiring mobilization of armies into the south that were more
urgently needed on the northern frontier. This policy, begun in the980s in the
wake of the failed expedition of 980–981, has been termed “appeasement
control” by some historians. It prevailed into the1050s when, as we will see,
dramatic events emboldened Song border officials to shift toward a more aggres-
sive posture in response to the rising power of Thang Long in the border regions.
Ly Cong Uan’s activities as king went through three phases. His early years
were occupied with gaining a firm grip on the material resources of his kingdom,
building his capital, and leading soldiers into vital borderlands. Beginning in
1016, he focused on establishing his authority in the spiritual realm, placing local
cults under the eye of court patronage. His final years were a time of personal
withdrawal in preparation for death and of releasing worldly affairs into the
hands of the next generation.
One of Ly Cong Uan’s first acts was to summon fugitives and vagabonds to
return to their native places and to command all villages and hamlets to repair
shrines and temples that had fallen into ruin. These measures reveal Ly Cong
Uan’s priorities: population control and the encouragement of religion. Very
little can now be known about Ly Cong Uan’s method of administering his
kingdom, but there is no evidence of any kind of bureaucratic organization.

His authority was based on personal charisma and the loyalty of his aristocratic
and monastic entourages.
The Ly family controlled the agricultural heartland of the Red River plain
where both the Ly home estates and Thang Long were located. This was where
the power of the Buddhist temples was strongest, and there was a close relation
between the monarchy and the temples. Ly Cong Uan supervised the ordination
of monks and appointed officials to oversee both the monks and the lands
belonging to temples. Because of this, the Ly family effectively controlled temple
estates as well as lands held directly by family members. Ly Cong Uan began his
reign with vast expenditures, bestowing robes on monks, distributing cash and
silk to elderly people in his home district, building over a dozen palaces in the
royal compound at Thang Long, and erecting at least fifteen new temples in
Thang Long and adjacent areas. Ly Cong Uan’s wealth was enough to cover
these expenditures, for, at the same time, he announced an amnesty for all tax
delinquents, declared a tax holiday for three years, and abolished all taxes for
orphans, widows, and the elderly.
Three years later, in1013, Ly Cong Uan published a scheme for taxation on
ponds (fish and pearls), fields (rice), and mulberry trees (silk); on goods traded in
upland markets, such as salt, lumber, aromatic wood for making incense, fruits,
and flowers; and on precious luxury items such as rhinoceros horns and elephant
tusks. He also specified that members of the Ly family could collect taxes
according to their rank. In1009, he had assigned ranks to his father, his mother,
six queens, an uncle, and a host of brothers, nephews, sons, and daughters, an
indication that his family background may not have been as muddled as various
accounts have suggested.
The outer regions of the Red River plain, beyond the Ly heartland, were in the
hands of families allied with the Ly by marriage. Ly Cong Uan abandoned a
scheme of dividing the plain into“ten circuits” that had been devised by Dinh Bo
Linh and replaced it with“twenty-four routes”; these were not administrative
jurisdictions but rather itineraries designating various localities. He organized the
southern provinces into“military outposts,” indicating a policy of garrisons and
patrols.
In 1011, Ly Cong Uan raised a large army and attacked“rebels” in the
southern provinces, in what is now Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. He campaigned
there for two years, burning villages and capturing local leaders. While returning
by sea in late1012, a great storm threatened to sink his boat, which he under-
stood as a divine judgment upon him for the violence he had brought upon so
many people. A speech was recorded that he reportedly made amidst the storm,
addressed to the heavenly power, in which he acknowledged that the innocent
might have been harmed in error but that he nevertheless could not refrain from

attacking these people because of their wickedness, cruelty, and savage resistance
to“civilizing instructions”; he begged forgiveness for his soldiers and expressed
his personal acceptance of any required punishment. In response to his appeal,
according to the story, the storm abated and the sea became calm.
This speech in the storm shows the religious sensibility of Ly Cong Uan, which
later Confucian historians criticized as“superstitious.” Ly Cong Uan represented
his people before the divine powers, and his was a civilizing task. He understood
the moral dilemma as well as the necessity of using violence on behalf of a worthy
cause. His sensitivity to the supernatural realm became increasingly evident as
the years passed.
For three years, 1013–1015, Ly Cong Uan sent soldiers into the northern
mountains, primarily the upland valleys of modern Ha Tuyen Province, to
chastise people there who were falling under the influence of the Nan Zhao
kingdom in Yunnan. Soldiers commanded by a brother reportedly killed or
captured thousands of people and obtained many horses. Song border officials
felt the reverberations of these events, which they interpreted as threatening to
their security, but the Song emperor commanded them to remain uninvolved.
In 1016, at the age of42, Ly Cong Uan appears to have achieved a sense of
success and contentment sufficient to enable a new focus for his attention. In that
year, there was an exceptionally good harvest, and Ly Cong Uan accordingly
declared a three-year holiday from having to pay land rents. He also took the
opportunity to obtain three more queens, ordain over a thousand monks, build
two Buddhist temples, dedicate four new images of the“heavenly emperor,” and
embark on a series of peregrinations to enjoy the famous sights of the Red River
plain.
During the course of his travels he initiated a kind of royal experience that
would be repeated by his son and grandson and that would accumulate a
pantheon of spirit guardians for the Ly realm. The pattern was for the king to
be visited in a dream by the most prominent spirit in the place of his sojourn,
having been aroused by the presence of the king’s virtue to announce itself as a
protector of the kingdom; in response to this, the king then worshipped the spirit
and built a temple for it in the capital. In this way, during the first half of the
eleventh century, a pantheon of spirit protectors was assembled from all parts of
the kingdom. All of the first three Ly kings were students of the Confucian
classics and devout Buddhists. They were also patrons of Daoist priests and
honored the supernatural realm of earth spirits, mountain spirits, water spirits,
and spirits of departed human beings, over which the“heavenly emperor” was
believed to rule. This eclectic attitude became characteristic of Vietnamese reli-
gious practice, which today remains attached to popular spirit cults that are often
incorporated into Buddhist and Daoist pantheons.

In 1024, a temple was built for Ly Cong Uan to use for reading and reciting the
Buddhist scriptures, a copy of which he had requested and received from the
Song court a few years earlier. Thereafter he began to withdraw from public
affairs. In1025, Van Hanh died. He had been Ly Cong Uan’s teacher, mentor,
and, to some extent, father figure. He had previously been an advisor to Le Hoan
and was a central figure in effecting the transition from the Le family at Hoa Lu
to the Ly family at Thang Long. It seems that Ly Cong Uan’s royal personality
was in some degree animated as an extension of Van Hanh’s expectations of him,
for from this time little of note is recorded about Ly Cong Uan until his death in
the spring of1028.
Ly Cong Uan’s achievement in shifting the throne from Hoa Lu to Thang Long
without bloodshed owed much to the power of the Buddhist temples in Giao that
mobilized manpower and resources on his behalf. But his personal qualities, so
far as they can be understood as a combination of martial valor, classical
erudition, and religious devotion, were also important in setting a standard of
leadership for his son and grandson.
Ly Phat Ma
Ly Phat Ma, Ly Cong Uan’s eldest son, was the most vigorous and charismatic of
all the Ly kings. He was born in1000 at Hoa Lu when his father was rising to
prominence at the Le court. In1012, he was assigned to reside in the“eastern
palace” built outside the walls of Thang Long, because his father wanted him“to
understand all about the people.” He thus escaped, to some extent, the stifling
fate of a palace-bound prince. Like his father, he received a broad education in
the Confucian classics, in the Buddhist sutras, and in military affairs. In1020,a t
the age of20, he and an experienced general were sent against a Cham army that
was threatening the southern border. The two armies met in what is now
northern Quang Binh Province and the Chams were decisively defeated. In
subsequent years, he led soldiers to repress rebels in the modern provinces of
Nghe An, Vinh Phu, and Lang Son, giving him familiarity with the kingdom’s
borderlands.
An uncle and two younger brothers of Ly Phat Ma also led armies to patrol the
frontiers and to attack rebels during these years. On the day of Ly Cong Uan’s
death, these three men, for reasons that have not been recorded, led their soldiers
into Thang Long and besieged the royal compound to dispute Ly Phat Ma’s
accession. The palace guard opened the gates and burst out, killing one of Ly
Phat Ma’s brothers and most of the rebel soldiers. The uncle and surviving
brother escaped, but the next day, when Ly Phat Ma formally took the throne,

they returned to beg forgiveness, and the new king pardoned them. The com-
mander of the palace guard, who had killed the rebellious prince, was later
honored with a posthumous cult and made a protector spirit of the kingdom.
Another of Ly Phat Ma’s brothers had for fifteen years been assigned to
oversee Hoa Lu, which during that time had become a bandit lair. When news
of the battle at the palace gates reached Hoa Lu, this prince raised his standard in
revolt. Ly Phat Ma mobilized his soldiers and, before marching against Hoa Lu,
paused to have his officers drink a blood oath of personal loyalty to him at the
shrine of the spirit of a mountain in Thanh Hoa that he had encountered in1020
during his expedition into the southern frontier. He believed that this spirit had
helped him to obtain victory against the Chams at that time and also that this
spirit had appeared to him in a dream to warn him of the treachery of his
brothers. As Ly Phat Ma’s soldiers approached Hoa Lu, the rebellious prince
submitted and was forgiven.
In dialogues between Ly Phat Ma and court officials that have been recorded
from the days following his father’s death, Ly Phat Ma expressed a strong sense
of family feeling for his disloyal brothers. Hoping that his kinsmen would submit
of their own accord, he sought to delay a resort to violence, saying:“I want to
hide my brothers’crimes and allow them to yield willingly, for, of all things, my
own flesh and blood is most precious.” There is no way to know whether these
words reveal Ly Phat Ma’s attitude toward family solidarity or are the handi-
work of later historians seeking to give a didactic gloss to a sad episode of
fraternal strife. In either case, Ly Phat Ma was a strong personality whose
quarter-century reign has been recorded with a relative abundance of words
attributed to him.
Two months after his father’s death, after settling affairs with his brothers, Ly
Phat Ma designated his5-year-old eldest son, Ly Nhat Ton, as crown prince and
sent him to live in the“eastern palace” outside the city gates, away from the
ritualized life of the royal compound. At the same time he appointed seven
women as queens, appointed men to serve in his immediate entourage, and
established a new hierarchy for the monkhood. His next act was to organize a
grand festival to feast, entertain, and distribute gifts to his followers. The occa-
sion was ostensibly his birthday celebration and it followed a precedent dating
back to985 when Le Hoan began the practice of royal birthday festivals, which
was continued by both Le Dinh and Ly Cong Uan. A distinctive feature of these
festivals was the construction of a bamboo mountain that over the years came to
be decorated with images of birds and animals, the calls of which royal guests
competed to imitate. Ly Phat Ma began a new style of“five-peaked bamboo
mountain” with elaborate decorations beyond precedent. It was only after
having thus attended to the joy and expectations of his followers that Ly Phat

Ma finally buried his father, seven months after Ly Cong Uan’s death, a delay
that later Confucian historians severely criticized.
Ly Phat Ma appears from the records as one of the most intelligent, vigorous,
and interesting kings in Vietnamese history: intelligent because the comparatively
large amount of information preserved from his reign shows a mind constantly in
motion, growing in its understanding of how to exercise royal authority and in a
dynamic and creative relation with a shifting circle of advisors and the rush of
events; vigorous because he was typically at the forefront of events and the prime
mover of them; interesting because, despite the intervening centuries, a living
personality shines through the words attributed to him. Vietnamese kings
followed the practice of Chinese emperors of designating the years of their rule
by reign titles, phrases that expressed the aspirations of the time. Ly Cong Uan
had used but one reign title at Thang Long: Thuan Thien, meaning“in Agree-
ment with Heaven,” expressing the Ly view that the Hoa Lu kings had not been
in harmony with the natural order of things. In comparison, Ly Phat Ma succes-
sively proclaimed six different reign titles, and each one represented an evolving
phase of his focus and activity.
His first reign title was Thien Thanh,“Heavenly Completion,” as if to signal
that he aspired no further than to complete what his father had begun. During
the six years of this period (1028–1034), he was compliant with the advice of
men who had been close to his father, filling in the blanks of what his father had
initiated and maintaining the peace that had been achieved under his father’s
leadership. Nevertheless, there were already indications of his energy. He went to
hunt elephants and personally captured one, a sport he would enjoy throughout
his reign. He regularly attended plowing and harvesting ceremonies at royal
estates. He built new palaces at Thang Long and150 temples and shrines
throughout the kingdom. He compiled a register of Daoist priests. He attacked
rebels in the southern provinces and in the northern mountains. And he married
a daughter to a local chieftain on the Song border in the modern province of
Lang Son, showing a keen and fateful interest in expanding his power into the
northern borderlands.
In 1034, Ly Phat Ma proclaimed a new reign title: Thong Thuy, meaning
“Utterly Auspicious.” This was the beginning of an era (1034–1039) in which he
often argued with or surprised his advisors. The event considered“auspicious”
that occasioned the change of reign title was the self-immolation by fire of two
monks who thereby produced potent relics in the form of their ashes and bones,
which Ly Phat Ma installed for veneration in a temple. The two monks had been
lifelong friends who through years of study and meditation had attained a high
level of erudition and spiritual enlightenment. Self-immolation was not unknown
among Buddhist monks in China at that time, but this is the first recorded

example of it in Vietnam. Shortly after this event, a box of Buddhist relics was
unearthed in the home district of the royal family, giving emphasis to the idea of
welcoming change. Ly Phat Ma marked the new reign title by demanding that his
officials use a more grandiloquent form of address with him.
From this time, Ly Phat Ma stepped beyond the perspective of his father’s
generation and took more direct personal control of the royal agenda. Aside
from irritating his court by promoting a favorite concubine to the status of
queen, thereby provoking conspiracies that he seems to have openly elicited
and then ruthlessly put down, he began to build ocean-going ships and to build
storehouses in frontier areas, suggesting an initiative to develop trade with
foreign lands. During the annual ceremonies to open fields for agricultural work,
he shocked his entourage by insisting on actually taking the plow. When his
officials objected, saying“This is farmer’s work,” he replied,“If I do not plow,
what rice can I use for my sacrifices to the spirits and what kind of leadership will
there be in the realm?” Previously, at these ceremonies he had simply received a
symbolic stalk of rice from a farmer. Now, not content with ritual, he wanted to
lead by example and believed that true sacrifice required his direct participation
in producing the rice to be offered up.
When the royal prison became overcrowded with people whose cases were not
being decided and he suspected that the judges were corrupt, his solution was to
lay the matter before the“heavenly emperor,” who replied by informing him in a
dream that the spirit of Pham Cu Lang, the general who had served Le Hoan
during the Song War of980–981, was being appointed to take care of the matter.
He accordingly built a shrine for Pham Cu Lang and made him the patron deity
of the court and prison, the practical effect of which presumes widespread respect
for Pham Cu Lang’s supernatural powers.
In 1039, Ly Phat Ma marched an army north to the upland valley of Cao
Bang, on the Song border, to attack Nung Ton Phuc, leader of the Tai-speaking
population there. For several years previously, Nung Ton Phuc had been a Ly
vassal, sending annual tribute to Thang Long, but in1038 he had renounced his
allegiance to the Ly and proclaimed himself a sovereign. Ly Phat Ma captured
him and four other prominent male members of the Nung family and brought
them to Thang Long where he publicly put them to death. In the wake of this
campaign, veins of gold and silver were discovered in the mountains of Cao
Bang. At about the same time, by coincidence, five Cham princes arrived at
Thang Long seeking refuge from political troubles in their kingdom and offering
their submission.
Court officials argued that the pacification of the Nung, the discovery of gold
and silver, and the arrival of submissive foreign princes were indications of good
government that required literary acknowledgment with a new reign title

meaning “Having the Way that Tallies with Heaven” (Can Phu Huu Dao) and
the addition of a phrase to the royal honorific meaning“Gold Flows, Silver
Appears, the Nung are Controlled, the [Cham] Frontier Yields” (Kim Dung
Ngan Sinh Nung Binh Phien Phuc). They cited the golden age of Yao and Shun,
the sage-kings of classical antiquity, whose virtue was so great that simply
donning their robes and folding their arms was enough to bring peace and order
to the human and natural worlds. The royal advisors sought to establish the idea
of ruling in accordance with principles, and to do that they needed to capture the
attention of a king who had his own intellectual momentum. At that time in
China, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052) was advocating a stronger role for scholars in
government. Vietnamese envoys regularly visited the Song court and knowledge
of trends there was promptly communicated to Thang Long.
Ly Phat Ma did not like what his advisors were saying. He is the first king
whose words have been recorded in relative abundance revealing a strong
personality. According to the court annals, eventually compiled asDai Viet Su
Ky Toan Thu(Complete Book of the History of Great Viet), he replied to his
entourage that as for the golden age of Yao and Shun, when everything was
perfect“simply from the ruler putting on robes and folding his arms,” he did not
understand it, because, being“a mere man assigned to stand above the officials
and the people,” he had to work hard at being king,“rising early and retiring
late, as if passing through a deep abyss, not knowing the way to understand
Heaven and Earth or the virtue that rises to the level of Yao and Shun.” Referring
to the events of pacifying the Nung, receiving the submission of Cham princes,
and finding gold and silver, he rhetorically asked:“How did ideas cause these
things? Or what was there to give prior notification of them? I am very worried
about this. What is a sufficiently noble and beautiful reign title? You must
stop this discussion.” Ly Phat Ma believed that good results came from hard
work, not from consulting books. He apparently considered that his advisors’
proposal was intended to diminish his own role, which he was endeavoring to
expand. He thought that he was in contention with them for control of the royal
agenda. Nevertheless, when they“obstinately” insisted, he finally gave in.
What happened during the three years of the ensuing reign period (1039–
1042) is an indication that the argument was about how to take up the slack
between Ly Phat Ma’s vigorous personality and the disorganized manner in
which he was ruling. Rather than smothering Ly Phat Ma’s initiative with
erudition, those who won the argument sought to strengthen his leadership by
codifying laws and procedures. The result was a book of law“suitable for the
current age.” The book no longer exists, but edicts recorded from these years
indicate detailed attention to military discipline, corrupt tax collectors, the
storage of rice against times of shortage, and cattle thieves. Issues related to a

new class of wealthy households, apparently from the rising Ly aristocracy and
allied families, were also addressed. These households were prohibited from
buying able-bodied male peasants as slaves, who were thereby removed from
the tax and conscription registers. On the other hand, householders were allowed
to kill nocturnal intruders who sought to molest their women. The court was
protecting both its source of revenue and the morale of its supporters.
The administration of royal justice, which Ly Phat Ma had attempted to
reform by establishing the cult of Pham Cu Lang a few years before, was now
reorganized and placed under the direction of a living person, the17-year-old
crown prince, Ly Nhat Ton, who subsequently became an expert in the law.
Queens and concubines, often used to advance the interests of their families, were
a perennial source of intrigue, so it is not surprising that at this time the hierarchy
of palace women was reorganized. The monks and people attached to temples
were another focus of royal attention, and an Arhat Assembly was instituted to
legislate monastic and temple affairs. When the book of laws was published in
1042, the Minh Dao,“Clear Way,” reign period was initiated, indicating that
codifying the laws had made clear the way to govern.
The short Mind Dao reign period (1042–44) was occupied with preparations
for and the actualization of a seaborne expedition more than a thousand kilo-
meters down the coast to sack the Cham capital. This was the climax of Ly Phat
Ma’s reign. In consulting with his entourage, he asked why he had never received
any envoy from the Cham king and wondered if it was due to some fault of his
own or if it was simply a matter of the Cham king trusting in the protection
afforded by distance and terrain. His advisors replied that the Cham king would
not acknowledge him without being attacked and thereby being forced to do so.
Moreover, they said that vassals at home would also become arrogant and
disrespectful unless he attacked the Cham king. Ly Phat Ma’s advisors were
ready to follow him on a difficult mission to a remote place in order to ensure
obedience and submission near at hand, an indication of the high degree to which
Ly kingship depended upon the momentum of charismatic leadership. In1043,
coins were minted, soldiers were recruited and trained, supplies and weapons
were assembled, and several hundred warships, of eight different classes, were
built.
Amidst these preparations for war were auspicious episodes of material objects
being mysteriously moved by Ly Phat Ma’s will. For example, while visiting the
ruins of an abandoned Buddhist temple, Ly Phat Ma saw a tilting stone pillar on
the verge of falling. He was about to order his men to set it up straight, but before
the words were out of his mouth the pillar suddenly straightened up by itself.
Literati at court, identified by a term indicating Confucianists (nho; Chineseru),
the first appearance of this term in the Vietnamese annals, were directed to

compose a rhyming narrative“to make known this extraordinary supernatural
event.” Royal advisors interpreted other signs and wonders before and during
the expedition as Heaven’s blessing on the king’s plans.
At the beginning of1044, Ly Phat Ma left Thang Long in the hands of Crown
Prince Ly Nhat Ton and embarked. He encountered the Cham king, Jaya
Sinhavarman II, in the vicinity of the modern city of Da Nang. Ly Phat Ma
immediately landed his soldiers and attacked. The Cham king was killed and his
soldiers fled. Many thousands were slain and five thousand were captured along
with thirty war elephants. Re-embarking, Ly Phat Ma arrived in early autumn at
the Cham capital of Vijaya, near the modern city of Qui Nhon in Binh Dinh
Province, where he took possession of the royal treasury and the palace women,
including a group of girls skilled in singing and dancing to“Indian tunes.” At the
end of the year, back in Thang Long, he celebrated victory by proclaiming a50
percent reduction in taxes and a new reign title, Thien Cam Thanh Vu,“Heaven
Inspires Saintly Martial Prowess.”
There followed an era of prosperous contentment as plunder from the south-
ern coast was digested and many fortunes were made. Edicts were published
against corrupt storehouse officers and prison guards. Ly Phat Ma used captured
elephants from Champa to pull him around in a lavishly ornamented wagon and
as decoys for his elephant hunts. He built a new palace for the exclusive use of
the women taken from Vijaya. Markets and post houses were built. An army was
sent to the Xieng Khouang plateau in modern Laos and returned with large herds
of cattle and many human captives. All this seemed to be a fulfillment of Ly Phat
Ma’s punning prophesy on the eve of his Cham expedition when an unusually
large gallstone the size and shape of a citron was found in a sacrificial goat. Since
the word for“citron” is a homonym of the word for“pleasure,” Ly Phat Ma
suggested that the big gallstone in the sacrificial goat was an indication that
“with a bit of hard work we will gain great pleasure and happiness.”
Among Ly Phat Ma’s vassals who traveled to Thang Long to congratulate him
on the success of the Cham adventure was Nung Tri Cao, son of Nung Ton Phuc,
the chieftain of the northern border valley of Cao Bang whom Ly Phat Ma had
captured and executed for treason in1039. At that time, Nung Tri Cao had
escaped capture, but in1041 he was seized and brought to Thang Long after
attempting to follow his father’s rebellious path. Having already put to death his
father and other male kinsmen, Ly Phat Ma“took pity” on Nung Tri Cao,
pardoned him, and sent him back to govern Cao Bang. For the next seven years,
Nung Tri Cao was a loyal vassal of Ly Phat Ma. But in1048, perhaps judging
that Thang Long had grown soft with Cham plunder and could be challenged, he
raised his banner in revolt. After three years of heavy fighting, Ly armies drove
Nung Tri Cao out of Cao Bang and into Song territory where he wreaked havoc

across the length and breadth of southern China, the modern provinces of
Guangxi and Guangdong, all the way to modern Guangzhou, before Song forces
ran him down and killed him in early1053.
Ly Phat Ma may have been disturbed in his declining years by the Nung Tri
Cao affair and by chronic fighting against rebels in Thanh Hoa, but these worries
did not disturb his preparation for death. In1049, he dreamed of Avalokitesvara,
the bodhisattva of mercy, seated on a“lotus throne” growing out of a pond; the
bodhisattva reached down and lifted Ly Phat Ma up to sit on the throne. When
he recounted this dream to his circle of advisors, they interpreted it as a portent
of Ly Phat Ma’s death, his departure to a higher realm of consciousness.
A Buddhist monk recommended that a temple be built on a stone pillar in the
middle of a pond with an image of Avalokitesvara seated on a lotus throne as in
the dream. This was done and monks continually circumambulated the pond
chanting a liturgy asking long life for their king. This temple, repeatedly rebuilt
through the centuries, exists in Hanoi today, known as the“One Pillar Pagoda”
(Chua Mot Cot). The beautiful and fragrant lotus blossom, with its stem rooted
in the filthy mud of a pond, called a“lotus throne,” was a popular symbol for the
enlightened mind rising above the turmoil of worldly affairs.
The reign title was changed in1049 to Sung Hung Dai Bao,“Reverencing and
Raising the Great Jewel,” referring to the“great jewel” of the kingdom, Ly Phat
Ma, being lifted up to the lotus throne and into the company of the bodhisattva.
Elaborate gardens and fishponds were built in these years to create a restful
environment for Ly Phat Ma during his last years on earth. At the same time, the
palace guard was reorganized, elderly advisors of merit were promoted, worthy
officials were feasted and given gifts, princes and princesses received new ranks
and titles, and a bell was hung in the palace courtyard to be rung by anyone
appealing to Ly Phat Ma for justice, indicating withdrawal of the king from the
accessibility of his accustomed routine.
In 1053, after a series of earthquakes, a dragon was reportedly sighted at a
pavilion in the inner courtyard of the palace. While some considered this to be a
good omen, one Buddhist monk said:“Dragons are supposed to fly in the sky.
This one has appeared on the ground. It is not a good omen.” In mid1054,L y
Phat Ma formally handed governing authority to his31-year-old heir, Ly Nhat
Ton. He died a few weeks later.
The reign of Ly Phat Ma stands out as a remarkable time of unfolding the
potential of Thang Long as a regional power. Ly Phat Ma had a vigorous
personality and he responded to events decisively, but he also assembled an
entourage of astute men with whom he was in a continuous and evolving
conversation about what to do next. In his early years as king, he followed his
father’s style of taking the advice of men he respected. Then, there was a period

in which he argued with his advisors, disputing with them about how to govern.
The major achievements of his reign in codifying laws, ravaging Champa, and
pushing into the Sino-Vietnamese borderlands came when a mutual appreciation
was established between him and his entourage and they had learned to work
together. His son, Ly Nhat Ton, had a less dynamic personality yet at the same
time a more grandiose vision of himself.
Ly Nhat Ton
Ly Nhat Ton was the first king of the post-Tang era to enjoy an uneventful
accession. Unlike his father and grandfather, he had not lived in the disturbed
atmosphere of Hoa Lu. He came of age witnessing and participating in the exuber-
ance of Ly Phat Ma’s reign. His father had readily delegated important tasks to him.
He led soldiers against rebels, he judged offenders, he presided over the court in his
father’s absence, and he always knew that he would be king. Later Vietnamese
historians remembered him as a good military strategist, a promoter of education,
an aesthete who enjoyed music and dance, a man who was both compassionate
toward his people and harsh toward his enemies, and also a man who wasted wealth
and manpower on the construction of palaces and temples; historians cited as
particularly extravagant a pleasure palace on the shore of West Lake, adjacent to
the royal compound in Thang Long, and a spectacular multi-storied stupa, located
beside a temple on the site now occupied by the Hanoi cathedral.
According to Chinese historians, Ly Nhat Ton violated propriety by arro-
gantly proclaiming himself an emperor, and he violated the border by sending his
soldiers to attack Song outposts. He was the first king at Thang Long to capture
the close attention of Chinese historians, and this was because, in the wake of
Nung Tri Cao’s rebellion, the buffer zone between Ly and Song had been
removed and soldiers from the two sides began to encounter one another on a
regular and increasingly hostile basis. Chinese historians argued that Ly Nhat
Ton bore much responsibility for provoking the Sino-Vietnamese war that broke
out in the1070s. Ly Nhat Ton’s fearless attitude toward the Song borderlands
can be included among factors contributing to that war, but there were many
other factors as well. As for claiming imperial status, Ly Nhat Ton was generally
careful to maintain a correct posture as vassal in all dealings with Song, but he
also“reformed letters” and “nurtured propriety” in ways that gave a rhetorical
and ritual appearance of following the forms of an imperial dynasty.
In the960s, Dinh Bo Linh had named his kingdom Dai Co Viet, a linguistically
hybrid term that included both Literary Chinese and vernacular Vietnamese. In
Literary Chinese,dai (Chinese da) means “great”; the vernacular Vietnamese

word co also means“great.” The pairing of these words in this name expresses a
phase in the linguistic shift from bilingualism to the emergence of the Vietnamese
language. By the time of Ly Nhat Ton, the formal acknowledgment of bilingual-
ism was no longer necessary. When he became king, Ly Nhat Ton dropped the
wordco from the name of the kingdom, henceforth known as Dai Viet, a
reformation of letters conforming to imperial usage by removing a non-classical
word. Ly Nhat Ton also honored his father and grandfather with posthumous
titles that followed the usage of imperial dynasties in the north. Furthermore, he
ordered the members of his court to wear ceremonial hats and boots according to
the fashion at the Song court. Perhaps most provocative of all, given the context
of growing border conflict with Song, he had three characters tattooed on the
foreheads of his soldiers meaning“The Son of Heaven’s Army”; “son of
Heaven” was a term that could mean only“the emperor.”
Despite aspiring toward usages prevailing in the Song Empire, Ly Nhat Ton
also followed the practices that had grown out of the Hoa Lu and Thang Long
experience of kingship. He named eight queens, celebrated his birthday festival,
plowed fields at agricultural ceremonies, convened Arhat Assemblies, and per-
sonally led soldiers against rebels. The number of dragons recorded as having
been sighted during his reign is considerably more than for any other Vietnamese
king. A great lover of Cham music, he had Cham songs translated and performed
with singing and dancing to the accompaniment of drums.
For routine government affairs, he apparently relied upon Ly Dao Thanh, a
royal kinsman, whom he appointed to serve as chancellor at the beginning of his
reign. Ly Dao Thanh remained chancellor for the duration of Ly Nhat Ton’s
reign and was a prominent leader at court in the early years of the next reign.
Chancellors, functioning as royal advisors, are recorded from the time of Le
Hoan, but Ly Dao Thanh was the first to eventually emerge as more than an
advisor. This was because Ly Nhat Ton never had an adult heir with whom to
share the duties of government.
Ly Nhat Ton’s chief preoccupation during the first twelve years of his reign
was to father a son. This led him to visit shrines and temples throughout the
kingdom to pray for an heir. In1063, 40 years old and still without a son, he
traveled to the temple of the Dharma Cloud Buddha, about thirty kilometers east
of Thang Long at the ancient site of Luy Lau, where Shi Xie had governed at the
turn of the third century. This was among the first Buddhist temples to be built in
the Red River plain. It was dedicated to a female Buddha famous for her ability
to send or stop rain. As the royal procession made its way through the fields
across the countryside, all the local people crowded around to catch a glimpse of
the king except for one young girl who ignored the hubbub and continued her
task of picking mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms. Her nonchalance

attracted the attention of Ly Nhat Ton and he brought her back to Thang Long.
Three years later, she gave birth to Ly Nhat Ton’s heir, Ly Can Duc. She was
known as Lady Y Lan and, during the reign of her son, she would exert a
dominating influence at the royal court. The Dharma Cloud Buddha conse-
quently became a prominent object of royal patronage, and its temple is today
called Chua Dau,“mulberry temple.”
Although Ly Nhat Ton found the mother of his heir in the mulberry fields near
Chua Dau, the prayer believed to have actually produced the happy event was
made at a temple in a western suburb of Thang Long. Ly Nhat Ton had sent a
servant to make prayers there on his behalf. Despite the success of his mission,
the servant was later beheaded at the door of the temple when it became known
that he was studying magical arts with the resident monk. Prowess in the use of
magic is a strong theme in the record of the Ly dynasty.
Ly Can Duc was born in early spring of1066. This event was the watershed of
Ly Nhat Ton’s reign. More sons were born later, but Ly Can Duc was immedi-
ately named the crown prince, and the remaining six years of Ly Nhat Ton’s life
were an echo of his father’s vigorous style. The centerpiece of these years was the
re-enactment of Ly Phat Ma’s 1044 expedition to Champa. In1068, Ly Nhat
Ton ordered the war boats to be repaired. In making plans for the campaign he
relied on Ly Thuong Kiet, the ranking military man at court.
Ly Thuong Kiet, born in1019 in Thang Long, had begun his career in royal
service as a eunuch during the reign of Ly Phat Ma. He advanced quickly in rank,
being a skillful military leader. He was not a member of the Ly family but had
been given the royal surname to honor his service. He lived long and became a
major figure in the late eleventh century.
Ly Nhat Ton embarked on his expedition in spring1069 and six weeks later
landed near modern Qui Nhon. The Cham capital of Vijaya lay some fifteen
kilometers inland from there. It is worth noting that the only battle fought by the
Vietnamese during the long voyage down the coast was at the modern site of
Dong Hoi, in Quang Binh Province, where a Cham army was positioned to
intercept them at the border. This is the very same place where, for fifty years in
battle after battle, southern Vietnamese stopped northern invasions during the
seventeenth century. The explanation for this lies in the coastal terrain. It is the
most defensible natural choke between mountains and sea for any force march-
ing by land on the entire Vietnamese coast, and it was very difficult for a pre-
modern naval force to advance south of this point without first taking control of
it, for there are seventy kilometers of barren sandy beach without fresh water
before the next river mouth.
When the Cham army was defeated at Vijaya, the Cham king, Rudravarman III,
fled to seek refuge with the Khmers. Ly Thuong Kiet pursued and captured

him before he could make good his escape. Ly Nhat Ton lingered for some time
to enjoy the Cham palaces, to feast his officers, and to personally perform“the
shield dance” and play a game of shuttlecock in the Cham throne room to
symbolize his conquest. After conducting a census of Vijaya, which totaled
2,560 households, he burned it to the ground and departed. He returned to
Thang Long after an absence of five months, entering the city parading several
thousand prisoners, among whom Rudravarman III was prominently displayed.
Rudravarman III was allowed to return to his kingdom after promising to cede
what is now the province of Quang Binh, giving the Vietnamese control of the
Dong Hoi choke point. Despite this, the Viets and the Chams continued to fight
for control of this region until the fifteenth century. Many Cham prisoners were
settled on the royal estates of the Ly family in modern Bac Ninh Province, across
the river from Thang Long, where they would exert a discernible cultural and
political influence into the thirteenth century.
In contrast to happy adventures along distant southern coasts, relations with
Song on the northern frontier went from bad to worse during Ly Nhat Ton’s
reign. Ly Phat Ma had used a policy of punitive expeditions and marriage
alliances to gradually extend his influence over chieftains in territories beyond
the effective control of Song outposts, most importantly in the modern provinces
of Lang Son and Cao Bang. Nung Tri Cao’s uprising had been to some extent a
reaction against this policy. While engaged in fighting with Ly armies in Cao
Bang, Nung Tri Cao requested to be accepted as a vassal of Song, hoping to elicit
Song assistance, but the Song emperor rejected the advice of officials eager to use
him against Thang Long and refused the request, observing that“he belongs to
the Viets.” When the Vietnamese forced Nung Tri Cao out of Cao Bang and into
Song territory, he was treated by Song as, and played the part of, a plundering
invader, and Song soldiers eventually put an end to him. The buffer of local
chieftains between Ly and Song had thus been eliminated, but without a clear
demarcation of the border.
Ly Nhat Ton became king with an ongoing and volatile border situation in the
wake of the Nung Tri Cao episode. There were opportunities for misunderstand-
ings and resentments as each side endeavored to secure the most favorable
terrain. The distant Song court took a passive attitude toward the potential for
trouble, at that time being more concerned with its northern frontier. However,
from the mid1050s, local Song officials, led by a man named Xiao Zhu, agitated
for military action against Thang Long to settle the border question. They
secretly trained military units and sheltered refugees from the Vietnamese side,
including army deserters. The contradiction between the pacific pronouncements
of the Song court and the devious, provocative policy of local Song officials
angered Ly Nhat Ton. He believed that Song officials were conspiring to provoke

war, shielding their activities behind the professions of amity issuing from the
imperial court. In1059, “hating Song’s back and forth,” he ordered a raid upon
the Song coast at modern Qinzhou, about eighty kilometers northeast of the
modern Sino-Vietnamese border,“to dazzle [Song] with soldiers and return.”
There followed a series of attacks and counterattacks in which local Song forces
fared poorly, resulting in a parley between Song and Ly envoys that temporarily
calmed things down. Seeking to avoid being drawn into a larger conflict, the
Song court accepted Thang Long’s explanation of the trouble and dismissed Xiao
Zhu and the other activist officials.
In the mid1060s, Han Qi, a prominent official at the Song court, explained the
rationale of the appeasement control policy that had been observed for eighty
years, apparently in response to arguments against it. He wrote that the lesson of
the980–981 war was that negotiation and conciliation were more effective than
punitive expeditions in eliciting Viet affirmations of obedience; that the Viet
territory was remote, its climate unhealthy, and even if conquered could not be
controlled; that no conceivable benefit could be obtained from sending soldiers
against Thang Long. Nevertheless, new incidents occurred, and, although the
official Song policy forbad direct provocation, local Song officials went so far as
to conspire with the Cham king to put pressure on Thang Long. During the
1060s, Song border officials were divided in their opinions with some conspiring
to engineer military action against Thang Long and others denouncing these
efforts as foolish and contrary to instructions. Meanwhile, Ly Nhat Ton,
emboldened by the passivity of the Song court and unaware that Song policy
was about to change, allowed his border officers to maintain an aggressive
stance. By the time of his death, in1072, the Song court was implementing plans
to attack Thang Long.
The Cham adventure exhausted Ly Nhat Ton’s vitality; two and a half years
later, he died at the age of49. His final years were full of worry: declining health,
border problems with Song, successive years of drought that depleted royal
granaries, but especially the lack of an adult heir. The prospect of a child king
lay behind the building of a shrine in1070 dedicated to the Duke of Zhou,
Confucius, and Confucius’ disciples. The Duke of Zhou was famous for ably
governing on behalf of a child king and then relinquishing power when the king
came of age. Confucius, the great teacher of good government, considered the
Duke of Zhou to be a model of righteousness and loyalty for officials serving a
child king. For centuries, historians had credited the Duke of Zhou with a
decisive role in establishing the house of Zhou, one of the greatest and longest-
lasting dynasties of Chinese antiquity.
The Thang Long shrine built in1070 contained statues of the Duke of Zhou,
of Confucius, and of Confucius’four best disciples, as well as painted images of

seventy-two of Confucius’ other disciples. Seasonal sacrifices were instituted at
the shrine to worship the spirits of these men, and4-year-old Crown Prince Ly
Can Duc was sent there to study. This combination of spirit cult and study hall
focused attention upon the small crown prince as the true and correct object of
loyalty. Famous men in the past were invoked as dynastic spirit protectors,
models of loyal service, correct teaching, and sincere learning. This shrine com-
bined appropriate worship with lessons in loyalty for officials and lessons in
kingship for the crown prince.
In the fifteenth century, when Confucian thought first dominated the Vietnam-
ese court, historians seeking to extend the genealogy of Confucian practice as far
as possible into the past recorded the1070 shrine as a Temple of Literature (Van
Mieu), which indeed it became in the fifteenth century, a type of temple that in
Ming China was dedicated to Confucius. However, the first Van Mieu in China
was built in1410, so an eleventh-century Van Mieu in Vietnam is implausible.
After years of dereliction during the twentieth-century wars, the Van Mieu in
Hanoi has been rebuilt and is now a major tourist site, claimed as the first
university in Vietnam.
Ly Dao Thanh, the leading figure at court in the1070s, was definitely familiar
with the Confucian classics, as were all educated people at that time. But he was
also a devout Buddhist. He valued the teachings of Confucius because they
exhorted officials to serve their sovereign loyally and instructed rulers how to
govern wisely. Yet, in time of need, he turned to Buddhism.
The death of Ly Nhat Ton in early1072 opened a perilous era. Song was
preparing to attack. The king, Ly Can Duc, was a child born of an ambitious
peasant mother, Lady Y Lan, who was intolerant of her low status in the
hierarchy of aristocratic palace women. Presiding at court was an old man, Ly
Dao Thanh, who was quickly surrounded by intrigues beyond his ability to
fathom. The commander of military forces, Ly Thuong Kiet, was experienced
and decisive, but also foolhardy and difficult to control.
The first three Ly kings made Thang Long a rising regional force, eventually
attracting the concerned attention of the Song court. The ensuing Sino-Vietnamese
war in the 1070s coincided with the beginning of an age of successive royal
minorities when mothers of kings and the men they favored exercised authority.
Outbreak of the Ly–Song War
The war of the1070s was closely related to the Song reform policies of Wang
Anshi (1021–1086), who became powerful in 1069 with the patronage of
Emperor Shenzong (r.1067–1085). At this time, Song government was rent with

conflict between reformers led by Wang Anshi and those who opposed reform,
generally called traditionalists. Wang Anshi initiated a broad range of fiscal,
military, and administrative reforms intended to increase state revenue, adminis-
trative efficiency, and military preparedness while improving the economic pos-
ition of peasants and curbing the power of wealthy families. The emperor’s
support enabled him to attempt to implement his reforms, but many powerful
traditionalists, supported by the empress dowager, mother of the emperor,
opposed him. The result was an era of fierce bureaucratic factionalism.
As for the traditional appeasement control policy toward Thang Long,Wang
Anshi considered it cravenly unprincipled and encouraged activist officials totake a
more “positive” attitude toward the border situation. He and his bureaucratic allies
had developed a pattern of successfully dealing with irritating frontier situations on
the Tibetan border in modern Gansu Province and against upland chieftainsin
Hunan and Sichuan Provinces. In each case, local military forces were used to build
up pressure on the frontier until the enemy forces began to break up into groups that
could be individually worn down and suppressed. When, in1070, the emperor
received a complaint lodged against an official on the Viet border for engagingin
provocative activities, Wang Anshi denounced the complaint and decided to apply
his experience of“nibbling operations” against tribal leaders to the far south,
imagining that Thang Long could be subdued in the same way.
Xiao Zhu, the aggressive official who had been dismissed several years before,
was reinstated and tasked with implementing the activist policy on the southern
border. However, he had meanwhile shifted his view and had no heart for the
enterprise. He reported that the Ly army was very strong, and he was accused of
going so far as to destroy documents on military plans. In1073, he was dismissed
and a man named Shen Qi was sent to replace him. Shen Qi was enthusiastic. He
reported that Thang Long was“small and ugly” and could be“squashed like a
bug.” But Wang Anshi lost confidence in him because his excessive confidence
led to carelessness, so he was replaced in1074 with yet another official, Liu Yi,
who rapidly reorganized preparations for war on a sound basis.
Part of the problem with local leadership in these years was that policy on the Viet
border had become enmeshed in the factional conflict between Wang Anshi and his
bureaucratic enemies. The emperor continued to receive complaints about the
aggressive activities of officials on the Viet border even as Wang Anshi was
endeavoring to initiate such activities. Opposition to Wang Anshi reached a cre-
scendo of intensity in1074 as his enemies, with the support of the empress dowager,
mobilized against two of his reforms, the so-called Agricultural Loans Act and the
Public Service Act. He was forced to retire from office for several months until, with
the emperor’s support, he returned to power in early1075, at which time the
situation on the southern frontier was sliding toward open war.

Despite the ostensible incompetence of Song border officials, much had
changed in the early1070s. Song officers aggressively expanded their system of
supervision over upland chieftains, competing with the Ly for their loyalty with
considerable success. Local troops and tribal levies were recruited and trained.
Weapons were distributed. Supplies were stockpiled. War boats were built. Élite
land and naval units were assembled. The trigger for initiating hostilities was an
effort to cut the trade routes between Nan Zhao in Yunnan and Thang Long.
This occurred in spring of1075. Meanwhile, at Thang Long, the adjustment to a
child king had not been without drama.
For one year following the accession of6-year-old Ly Can Duc in early1072,
government was in the hands of Ly Dao Thanh, a member of the royal family
who had presided over Ly Nhat Ton’s court, and the senior queen, subsequently
known as the Duong queen mother, who served as the regent and official
adoptive mother of the king, for Ly Can Duc’s birth mother, Lady Y Lan, was
a commoner and ineligible to hold the rank of queen. During that time, the court
busily attended to routine matters as if making a studied effort to project an
appearance of normalcy: the king made sacrifices at shrines, visited various
palaces, celebrated his birthday festival, attended a“Buddha-bathing festival,”
granted an amnesty to prisoners, presided over an examination of monks to test
their literary skills for appointment as scribes at court, chose two queens, and
conferred promotions upon Commander-in-Chief Ly Thuong Kiet and his senior
officers.
When the monsoon rains continued well into autumn, the Dharma Cloud
Buddha was paraded to the capital from its temple in the native district of Lady
Y Lan. It was taken to a temple in the royal compound where the king prayed for
the rain to stop, and the rain immediately stopped. This demonstration of
supernatural power by a deity from Lady Y Lan’s natal village came shortly
before a palace coup in which Lady Y Lan seized control of the court and was
named queen mother and regent. The Duong queen mother and seventy-two
other palace women were interred in Ly Nhat Ton’s tomb, whether dead or alive
is unclear, and Ly Dao Thanh was exiled to the southern border in modern Nghe
An Province.
According to the court chronicle, Lady Y Lan was unhappy at“not being able
to participate in government” and complained to her son that the Duong queen
mother was“working hard to accumulate power, riches, and honor”; the king,
“although a child,” knew who his real mother was and accordingly ordered the
retirement of the Duong queen mother and the elevation of Lady Y Lan. Histor-
ians have tended to assume that this coup was accomplished with the assistance
of Ly Thuong Kiet, the general who had captured the Cham king in1069 and
was commander of all military forces, which is plausible because he was

presumably the only person in a position to accomplish it, although evidence of
this has not been preserved. Assuming that this, nevertheless, was the case, it is
not hard to imagine, in the light of later events, that Ly Thuong Kiet championed
Lady Y Lan’s resentment as a way of bringing into the court new leaders who
understood the urgency of the situation developing on the northern border.
During Ly Can Duc’s first year as king, activities recorded at court show no
indication of addressing what an alert military commander would have under-
stood as a serious threat.
In Nghe An, beside the provincial shrine for local deities, Ly Dao Thanh built a
garden for the bodhisattva Ksitagarbha and erected in it a Buddha statue and an
ancestral tablet for Ly Nhat Ton where he worshipped“at dawn and at dusk.”
Ksitagarbha is the bodhisattva believed to be responsible for instructing the
unfortunate souls who live in the age of darkness, from the historical Buddha’s
death until the arrival of Maitreya,“the Buddha of the future.” Ly Dao Thanh
viewed himself as living in the benighted age from Ly Nhat Ton’s death to Ly
Can Duc’s maturity. He wanted to instruct his contemporaries about how to
survive this dangerous time and took comfort from the bodhisattva for his task.
He may have been too preoccupied with Ly Can Duc’s minority accession to take
adequate note of events on the northern border. On the other hand, Ly Thuong
Kiet may have been too preoccupied with military affairs on the border to
appreciate Ly Dao Thanh’s leadership at court. But the urgency of events
required that these two men work together.
In 1074, Ly Dao Thanh was called back to resume his duties at court. He lost
no time in seeking new talent to serve at court. Although the wisdom of the old
generation was acknowledged, with officials over80 years of age being issued
staffs and chairs for leaning and sitting at court, provision was also made for
raising a new generation of young men to positions of importance. Early in1075,
three levels of examinations were held to select men educated in Confucian
studies; what exactly this meant in that time and place is not known, but
presumably it included the“five books” of the traditional Confucian education
in history, poetry, ritual, prognostication, and annals. This is the first recorded
instance of the Vietnamese royal court holding an exam to identify talent among
commoners educated specifically in Confucianism. The highest honors were
conferred upon Le Van Thinh, who was immediately assigned to be Ly Can
Duc’s teacher. Later that year, in time of drought, the Dharma Cloud Buddha
was again paraded to Thang Long, this time to hear the king’s prayer for rain, a
prayer that was reportedly efficacious. This is the last felicitous event recorded
before Thang Long passed into the shadows of war.
In late spring and early summer of1075, fighting erupted in Cao Bang between
Viet soldiers and a chieftain who had submitted to Song and cut the route by

which Thang Long had been receiving horses in trade with the Nan Zhao
kingdom of Yunnan. Warfare continued through the year and spread as Liu
Yi’s military preparations along the border became impossible for Thang Long to
ignore. Ly Thuong Kiet decided to take the initiative with a pre-emptive strike to
ravage Song border jurisdictions and destroy accumulated supplies. Late in1075,
as terrain was drying out from the monsoon rains and large-scale military
campaigns became practicable, Song border officers reported indications of a
major attack, and within a week a combined land and sea force of between eighty
and one hundred thousand Viets crossed the border.
Ly Thuong Kiet led naval forces and within three days easily captured the main
Song ports facing the Viet coast, at modern Qinzhou and Hepu. He disembarked
his soldiers and, joined by an army marching down the Zuo River from Cao
Bang and Lang Son, lay siege to Nanning, the Song headquarters facing the
Vietnamese border. Caught by surprise and fearing a naval attack on Guang-
zhou, Song officials in the region were ordered to avoid battle and wait for
reinforcements. After a siege of forty-two days, Nanning fell, much to the
astonishment of Wang Anshi who had confidently predicted that the city was
too strong to be taken. After destroying Nanning and killing tens of thousands of
people, the Viets withdrew back across the border, taking with them much
plunder and many captives. In a campaign of less than three months, Ly Thuong
Kiet set back Song war preparations and stung Wang Anshi into an angry haste.
Wherever Ly Thuong Kiet’s soldiers had gone on Song territory they set up signs
at crossroads proclaiming three reasons for the attack. The first two reasons were
closely related to the actual situation along the border. First, Ly Thuong Kiet
accused Song of harboring rebels against Thang Long and refusing to surrender
them. This referred to the immediate cause of the fighting when Nung chieftains
who had been Ly vassals shifted their allegiance to Song. Just prior to the outbreak
of fighting in early1075, Thang Long had requested the return of an upland
chieftain who had gone over to Song with seven hundred of his followers; Song
refused, saying that these people had submitted to Song and consequently
belonged to Song. This was different from prior policy during the decades of Song
pacifism when Song strictly refused to meddle with Thang Long’s vassals and even
returned those who sought refuge with Song. Second, Ly Thuong Kiet accused
Song of training and organizing soldiers on the border for the purpose of attacking
Thang Long. This, of course, was true, and later Chinese historians considered the
war preparations of Liu Yi and his predecessor as provocative.
The third reason is remarkable for the knowledge it reveals of Song politics. It
is seemingly a riposte to a Song edict, reportedly composed personally by Wang
Anshi and published early in the campaign, which denounced the invasion and
declared Song’s intention of attacking the Viet kingdom, among other reasons, to

rescue the people from Thang Long’s harsh exactions. Ly Thuong Kiet, for his
part, claimed that he had come to rescue the people suffering from Wang Anshi’s
Agricultural Loan and Public Service Acts, the controversial reforms that had
provoked such resistance in the Song government as to force Wang Anshi into
temporary retirement in1074–1075. Ly Thuong Kiet was inserting his campaign
into Song bureaucratic factionalism by claiming to be an ally of Wang Anshi’s
political enemies. This was said to have especially nettled Wang Anshi and to
have hardened his eagerness to strike back.
One of the successes of Ly Thuong Kiet’s pre-emptive strike was to provoke a
Song response so motivated by a desire for revenge that it was poorly prepared.
Ly Thuong Kiet had also taken many captives that would be used as leverage in
future negotiations. Furthermore, many upland chieftains who had gone over to
Song now returned their allegiance to Thang Long. But his most important
achievement was the destruction of the Song navy that had been assembled at
Qinzhou and Hepu. This had decisive repercussions for future battles. The
surprise of Ly Thuong Kiet’s attack, as perceived by Song, was achieved by his
sailing directly from the Cham frontier to attack the Song coastal ports. Ly
Thuong Kiet spent several months prior to his Song attack in the far south
skirmishing with Cham border forces, mapping terrain, and settling military
colonists. Song diplomacy was exciting Cham kings with visions of revenge for
Thang Long having twice plundered Vijaya during the previous thirty years.
Cham–Viet hostilities were nearly constant during this time.
Wang Anshi’s enemies at the Song court made sure that the decision to launch
a full-scale invasion of the Viet kingdom was not made without extensive
discussion and spirited dissent. Fu Bi, a traditionalist who opposed Wang Anshi’s
reforms, argued that the Viet lands were remote and difficult to conquer. Zhang
Fangbing, another traditionalist, submitted a nine-point argument against the
projected expedition, saying that Viet military strength was greater than in the
past, having successfully attacked and inflicted great damage upon Song border
jurisdictions; that cavalry was of no use in the Viet lowlands, which were
screened by rugged mountains and wide rivers; that if success could not be
obtained in one winter’s campaign the army would have to be withdrawn when
the summer rains began; and that the Viet kingdom had been an important
frontier jurisdiction of the old Tang Empire but had now become a major
regional power that could not be knocked out in one blow. A naval expert, Su
Ziyuan, cautioned that the Viets had a powerful navy and were“skilled in water
battle”; he pointed out that it would be impossible to take Thang Long without
naval control of the Red River, which would be no easy task.
Wu Chong, another enemy of Wang Anshi, although unsuccessful in arguing
against the expedition, obtained the emperor’s approval of his recommendation

to appoint Guo Kuei as senior commander of the army. Wang Anshi’s candidate,
Zhao Xie, was named second-in-command. As can be expected, Guo Kuei and
Zhao Xie did not get along. While Guo Kuei was slow and methodical, Zhao Xie
was alert to tactical opportunities. Furthermore, despite being recommended by
Wang Anshi, Zhao Xie did not want this assignment and repeatedly requested to
be excused, unconvinced that the expedition was well advised.
The Ly–Song War
The Viets spent1076 preparing defenses. It is recorded that, in late spring of this
year, the 10-year-old king was taken to inspect a “water barrier,” which,
considering the course of later battles, was likely an underwater obstacle sealing
the Bach Dang estuary. The naval war began three months before major land
battles and continued for two months after withdrawal of the Song army. No
details of the naval fighting survive except that there were“many sea battles,”
that the Song navy never penetrated the Red River plain, and that Thang Long’s
navy continued attacking long after the withdrawal of Song land forces. Viet
supremacy at sea, demonstrated against Champa in1044 and 1069, was guar-
anteed by the crippling blow dealt to Song naval forces by Ly Thuong Kiet in
1075, from which Song had not taken time to recover before launching its attack.
Guo Kuei advanced his headquarters to Nanning in late autumn and within a
month had advanced to the border opposite Lang Son. There he waited for over two
months while one of his generals took a side trip to secure Cao Bang. Zhao Xie was
critical of the Cao Bang campaign, believing that too much time was lost bringing
the soldiers sent there back to join the main body of the expedition before advan-
cing. He argued that these soldiers should be sent directly through the mountains
toward Thang Long from Cao Bang, allowing the main force to press on, but his
opinion was ignored. Furthermore, stubborn Viet resistance in Cao Bang prolonged
the delay. Finally, near the end of the lunar year, the Song expedition, numbering
around 50,000 troops and more than double that number of porters, crossed into
Viet territory, pushed aside border guard units, marched down to the lowlands, and
arrived at the Cau River where the Viets had prepared their defenses.
On the road from the border to Thang Long, the Cau River is the only natural
obstacle between the mountains and the Red River. Around forty-five kilometers
northeast of Thang Long, it is anchored upstream in the valleys leading to Cao Bang
and downstream it joins its waters with other rivers at Pha Lai, beyond which lie
soggy plains unsuitable for the movement of large land armies. It shielded the
heartland of old Giao that was filled with Buddhist temples and the royal estates
of the Ly in modern Bac Ninh Province. The Viets waited for the Song army on the

southern bank of the river, where they had built multiple layers of bamboo fences
and anchored over four hundred war boats. The Song army arrived on the northern
bank of the river and there it stalled for lack of naval support.
Zhao Xie sent soldiers to cut down trees for building catapults and floating
bridges. The Song prepared an attack at a place where a hill on the northern side
of the river enabled soldiers to assemble out of sight of Viet observers perched in
watchtowers on the southern bank. Song catapults are said to have sent stones
falling like rain upon the Viet war boats to open a way for the attack. Several
hundred Song soldiers crossed the river on floating bridges before the bridges were
destroyed. They set many bamboo defense walls aflame but the walls werein so
many layers that they could not break through. Song reinforcements arrived by raft
and advanced a maximum of eight kilometers toward Thang Long, but Viet troops
eventually succeeded in killing or capturing all the Song soldiers who had crossed
the river. This turned out to be the furthest advance of the Song expedition.
After more than a month of repulsing further Song efforts to cross the river, Ly
Thuong Kiet was emboldened to essay a frontal assault to disperse the Song
army. Under cover of night, he led thousands of soldiers across the river. The
Song front line began to collapse until all the reserve forces, including cavalry
units and Guo Kuei’s bodyguard, moved up and forced the Viets back into the
river, capturing a Viet general and resulting in the drowning of two Ly princes.
With each side having demonstrated the best that it could do in battle but without
dislodging the other, the stalemate began to work against the Song forces. Provi-
sions were nearly depleted. Over half the army was dead from battle, heatexhaus-
tion, or tropical fevers, and most survivors were weak from illness. Furthermore, the
monsoon rains were about to begin. The Song generals wanted to withdraw but they
dared not do so without some token of success. The Viets understood this, and a
message from Ly Can Duc to the Song emperor was delivered to the Song encamp-
ment apologizing for having violated Song territory in the past, promising not to do
so again, requesting permission to send tribute and re-establish normal relations,
and offering a proposal for marking a mutually acceptable border.
Guo Kuei and Zhao Xie decided to regard this as a formal submission and
hastened to withdraw as their rearguard held off Viet attacks. Song forces
endeavored to retain control of Lang Son and Cao Bang, but within a few
months, attacking Viet forces regained Lang Son and began to put pressure on
Cao Bang. Song officials used criminals to work the gold and silver mines of Cao
Bang until late1079, when the Ly and Song courts reached a settlement. The
Song abandoned its claims in Lang Son and Cao Bang. The Ly returned a couple
hundred remaining captives seized during Ly Thuong Kiet’s pre-emptive attack
and resumed their pose as loyal imperial vassals. After further negotiations over
districts at the upland extremity of the frontier in northeastern Cao Bang, a

border agreement was finalized in1088. The border drawn at that time, with
minor changes through the centuries, was basically the same as the Sino-
Vietnamese border today.
The war we have described was a war of mutual aggravation. The factors
contributing to its outbreak emerged from the context of internal imperial
politics. Although the Viets had to some extent drifted away from the imperial
world after the fall of Tang, they were still connected to it, as Ly Thuong Kiet’s
use of Wang Anshi’s reform legislation in his war propaganda revealed, not to
mention the sharing of a single civilization. The Nung Tri Cao uprising, Ly
border exuberance, and Wang Anshi’s activist inclinations shook Song policy
from decades of passivity on its southern frontier. The question of drawing a
border to separate regions that for centuries had belonged to the same imperial
world was delayed for so long because of the rugged mountains and the screen of
tribal vassals. The rise of Thang Long under the first three Ly kings, however,
accelerated the dangers of an unmarked border and the resolution of border
irritations became a priority for both sides.
The consciousness of a fixed border between northern and southern domains
of the same imperial world is expressed in a poem that later historians attributed
to Ly Thuong Kiet. It was supposedly sung in temples along the southern bank of
the Cau River during the weeks of fighting to motivate the Viet soldiers:“The
mountains and rivers of the south are the dwelling place of the southern emperor;
the border has been fixed in the book of Heaven; how dare these uncouth rebels
come in for plunder; you will all go out to see their defeat and ruin.”
If this story is true, it is unlikely that the poem was sung as it exists today, for it
is written in Literary Chinese following Tang-style prosodic rules, which would
probably not have been wholly intelligible to Viet soldiers. Furthermore, it is
unlikely to have been written by Ly Thuong Kiet, who was neither a literary man
nor known to have produced any other literary works. The story of singing in
temples to give heart to soldiers on the eve of battle is very plausible, but whether
it was exactly this poem that was sung and whether this poem was written in the
eleventh century or at a later time are questions without irrefutable answers.
Nevertheless, it is plausible to imagine that the border consciousness expressed in
the poem arose in the context of drawing the Sino-Vietnamese border in the
eleventh century. This poem also expresses what became a tenet of Vietnamese
historiography in the thirteenth century when China was conquered by the
Mongols and Thang Long posed as the last remaining outpost of civilization: a
southern imperial tradition with its own mandate of Heaven. Whatever else it
did, by emphasizing a border separating two imperial mandates, the poem
simultaneously emphasized the connectedness, if not unity, of the two mandates
as northern and southern parts of a whole.

When Ly Thuong Kiet returned from his foray across the Song border in1076,
his deeds were announced before the tombs of the three first Ly kings and Ly Can
Duc’s reign title was changed to trumpet a“heroic, martial, glorious victory.”
However, mobilizing to meet the impending Song invasion had been a sobering
experience. While Ly Thuong Kiet trained soldiers and prepared defenses along
the Cau River, Ly Dao Thanh selected a cadre of educated men to supervise the
military camps, to stockpile supplies, and to staff a communications network. An
edict was also published“to request straight talk.” This appeal for plain speak-
ing, without fear of reprisal, was an unusual, if not desperate, call for any and all
ideas. In late1076, as Song forces were entering the kingdom, Le Van Thinh, the
man selected the previous year to serve as tutor to the king, was made minister in
charge of all military affairs. A few months later, as Song forces were withdraw-
ing in early1077, an exam was organized to select men with knowledge of
“letters and laws.” Looking beyond the military emergency, Ly Dao Thanh
was endeavoring to build a system of government capable of operating without
the firm and constant hand of a vigorous adult king.
The monks were also active. In spring1077, at the peak of fighting along the Cau
River, an assembly was convened at Thang Long to recite the Nhan Vuong (Chinese
Renwang) Sutra,“Sutra on the Benevolent Kings,” which was commonly recited to
avert disasters. According to a popular explanation for the outcome of the war, the
Song generals believed that their inability to obtain victory was due to the power of
the Dharma Cloud Buddha, whose temple was not far from the battlefield. Song
soldiers were sent to raid the temple and take away the statue of the Buddha, which
was later abandoned in a forest as Song soldiers fled from a Viet ambush on their
way out of the country. The Buddha was thought to be lost until a forest fire during
the next dry season consumed all the trees in the region except for one spot ofdense
and luxuriant foliage in which the Buddha was found. This miracle was reported to
the king, who returned the Buddha to its temple with great honors.
The Ly–Song War of the1070s emerged from the specific problem of defining
a border where none had existed before. There was aggression on both sides. The
negotiations that followed the hostilities and that led to a resolution of outstand-
ing issues are more typical of Sino-Vietnamese relations than are the few episodes
of war during the past millennium.
Ly Can Duc
Ly Dao Thanh died in1081.I n 1085, 19-year-old Ly Can Duc announced his
majority by proclaiming a new reign title and appointing Le Van Thinh as
chancellor. Le Van Thinh had risen rapidly as a protégé of Ly Dao Thanh. In

1084, he successfully negotiated border questions with Song officials. From1085
to 1096 he was the dominant figure at court.
According to historical records, in the late 1080s there were a series of
initiatives that appear to have been concerned with establishing positions and
hierarchies. In1086, a literary exam was held to select a man to be a Han Lam
Hoc Si (Chinese Hanlin Xueshi), the first reference in Vietnamese history to a
Han Lam Scholar. In Tang and Song government, such men were assigned to
what was called the Hanlin Academy where erudite men were called on for
various tasks requiring academic knowledge or literary skill. A privy council
(Bi Thu Cac; Chinese Mishu Ge) was instituted in1087, a kind of secretariat
where the most secret matters were handled. In1088 a Buddhist monk was
appointed Quoc Su (Chinese Guoshi),“Teacher of the Kingdom,” a title that had
been given to a pre-eminent monk since the time of Le Hoan. At the same time,
ten clerks were given appointments, seemingly to assist in administering the
Buddhist temples, for, also at that time, all the Buddhist temples in the kingdom
were categorized into three classes depending upon their wealth in fields, slaves,
and treasure; high-ranking officials were appointed to oversee temple affairs. In
1089, a classification of positions was determined for“civil and military officials
including those who personally attended the king and those with miscellaneous
duties.” All of these initiatives apparently came from Le Van Thinh.
Le Van Thinh’s appointment as chancellor in1085 came as Lady Y Lan ended
her regency on behalf of her son the king. From this time Lady Y Lan began to
occupy herself with traveling and with building temples and stupas. She became
famous as a lavish patron of the Buddhist monks. Her pursuit of interests away
from the court opened an opportunity for Le Van Thinh to make changes that
brought increasing authority into his hands. As the king’s former teacher and
chief advisor, Le Van Thinh enjoyed much power, particularly since surviving
information portrays Ly Can Duc as unassertive.
Le Van Thinh’s ascendance diminished members of the Ly royal family. The
king had a younger brother and many uncles. It is recorded that, in1095, the
king called all the nobles of the royal family to come to court. No further
information is recorded about this, but shortly thereafter the king ended a
drought by proclaiming an amnesty for prisoners and by canceling or reducing
the collection of taxes. Whether or not these measures were intended to reduce Le
Van Thinh’s control of affairs can be no more than a matter of conjecture, but
within a few months, in early1096, a curious episode brought an end to Le Van
Thinh’s career.
Ly Can Duc was in a small boat on West Lake, adjacent to the royal com-
pound at Thang Long, on an excursion to watch fishermen. Suddenly the lake
was covered with a thick mist. The splashing of another boat’s oars was heard

approaching and the king threw a spear into the mist toward the sound.
A moment later the mist lifted to reveal a tiger in the royal boat. A fisherman
in a nearby boat threw his net over the threatening form, which turned out to be
Le Van Thinh. Le Van Thinh was found guilty of plotting to murder the king and
sentenced to die. In consideration of his earlier“merit,” however, Ly Can Duc
remitted the death penalty and instead banished him to a frontier outpost in the
mountains; no further information survives about him.
Court historians glossed this event by explaining that Le Van Thinh had
acquired a slave from Yunnan who could do“strange tricks,” and this slave
taught him how to masquerade as a tiger. No further information survives about
Le Van Thinh, but modern archaeologists have discovered an elaborate burial
place prepared for him, though never used, located in his home district in modern
Bac Ninh Province. Without further information the most plausible conjecture is
that senior members of the royal family acted to secure their interests against a
commoner upstart. The brave fisherman was later honored as a guardian deity of
the kingdom.
Shortly before Le Van Thinh was undone in the boat, whether by coincidence
or as part of some larger set of events, Lady Y Lan gave a feast for monks at
Thang Long and asked the Quoc Su, a senior monk and“Teacher of the
Kingdom,” several questions about the Buddha, the source of enlightenment,
and the“patriarchs” who transmitted enlightenment. The monk explained how
the Buddha had transmitted enlightenment to the lineage of patriarchs in the
Thien (Chinese Chan; Japanese Zen) School where it was passed from generation
to generation outside of scriptural teachings. He explained how this lineage had
entered the Viet lands and identified the patriarchs who possessed the“mind
seal” of the Buddha’s teaching at that time. Lady Y Lan was very pleased with
this explanation and gave the Quoc Su gifts and a new name, Thong Bien,
“Understanding and Discrimination.” Lady Y Lan’s interest in the authoritative
lineage of correct teaching suggests the possibility of a similar concern at that
time with the royal bloodline, a concern that grew from year to year as Ly Can
Duc was childless.
After the Song War of the1070s, there is no record of Ly Thuong Kiet playing
any part in court affairs, although it is recorded that he patronized many famous
monks. He appears to have spent most of his time away from Thang Long, in
particular in the southern provinces and on the Cham frontier, where the few bits
of information recorded from his later years took place. He has been credited
with building Buddhist temples in Thanh Hoa Province and with being particu-
larly active in stamping out the worship of“evil spirits.” He seems to have been a
man of action with small tolerance for the palace life of Thang Long, or perhaps
the Ly royal family enforced upon him a quasi-banishment to work in the

southern provinces to preclude his involvement in court politics. His final cam-
paigns, in1103–1104, when he was already in his eighties, show him as Thang
Long’s lord of the southern marchlands.
In 1103, a rebellion broke out in the southernmost province, modern Nghe An
and Ha Tinh Provinces, led by a magician named Ly Giac, who was thought to
be able to conjure soldiers out of trees and bushes. Ly Thuong Kiet attacked Ly
Giac and sent him fleeing to the Cham king (Jaya Indravarman II). With Ly Giac
whispering in his ear, Jaya Indravarman II seized border districts and raided
deeper into Viet territory. Ly Thuong Kiet led his men south, defeated the
Chams, and re-established frontier defenses. One year later, he died and was
accorded great honors.
Many stories have been recorded about Buddhist monks during the Ly dyn-
asty. The poems of an official at court in the1080s and1090s, Doan Van Kham,
give written portraits of two contrasting kinds of monks, those who withdrew
from human society to meditate as hermits and those who served society as
teachers and royal advisors. In the late1080s, as Le Van Thinh expanded the size
of officialdom, Doan Van Kham described himself as “roped and fettered”
among the“flock” of officials at court, frustrated in his desire to visit the monk
Quang Tri, who dwelt in seclusion on a mountain. When news of Quang Tri’s
death arrived with his desire still unfulfilled, Doan Van Kham comforted himself
by writing that despite leaving behind no tomb where he could be venerated,
Quang Tri had left his pure essence, which could be encountered everywhere.
Doan Van Kham wrote another poem on the death of the monk Chan Khong in
1100. He describes Chan Khong as a pillar of society, surrounded by disciples,
and in death continuing to serve others with his tomb as a place of pilgrimage
and meditation. Behind these two classical stereotypes, however, were monks
famous for magic and sorcery, the most famous of whom was Tu Dao Hanh.
According to Tu Dao Hanh’s biography, his father, a temple administrator in
Thang Long, had an altercation with a Ly nobleman who hired a magician
named Dai Dien to kill him. Tu Dao Hanh, after spending years acquiring
supernatural powers, killed Dai Dien to avenge his father. He then wandered
from temple to temple in search of enlightenment and eventually achieved his
goal. He thereafter became famous for taming snakes and wild beasts, producing
rain, and curing sickness. In those days, the king was advancing in years and
remained childless.
In 1112, a small boy about3 years old appeared on the seashore in Thanh
Hoa. He spoke like an adult, knew all about Ly Can Duc, and called himself

entire royal court opposed this. Some advised that if the boy was truly what he
seemed to be then he should be able to reincarnate himself into the royal family,
and if he could do that then there could be no objection to making him crown
prince. Ly Can Duc accordingly organized a reincarnation ceremony for the
child.
When he learned of this, Tu Dao Hanh realized that Giac Hoang was a
reincarnation of his enemy, the magician Dai Dien, so he used his own magical
powers to disrupt the ceremony. When Ly Can Duc investigated the matter, Tu
Dao Hanh confessed to what he had done and was arrested. Tu Dao Hanh
implored the Sung Hien Marquis, a brother of Ly Can Duc and also childless, to
help him, in which case he promised to assist the marquis to become the father of
the next king. The Sung Hien Marquis told Ly Can Duc that Tu Dao Hanh’s
power was demonstrably greater than that of Giac Hoang and that accordingly it
would be better to rely upon Tu Dao Hanh to supply an heir to the throne. Ly
Can Duc agreed with this. According to one account, Giac Hoang died shortly
after and was buried at a prestigious temple.
During a later visit to the Sung Hien Marquis, Tu Dao Hanh supposedly used
his magical powers to cause the nobleman’s wife to become pregnant, and he told
the marquis to inform him when the baby was about to be born. In1116, when a
messenger from the marquis arrived at the temple where Tu Dao Hanh resided to
say that birth was imminent, Tu Dao Hanh prepared to die and passed away. He
was reincarnated as the son of the Sung Hien Marquis and was named Ly Duong
Hoan. Two years later, Ly Can Duc,52 years old and still childless, selected Ly
Duong Hoan to be the crown prince. In this way, Tu Dao Hanh was reincarnated
to become the fifth Ly king.
This odd tale, a mixture of fact and fancy, was forced out of the human imagin-
ation by the same desperation to have an heir that had oppressed Ly Nhat Tonuntil
the birth of Ly Can Duc. Ly Can Duc never had any children, and by the1110s, as he
approached and entered his sixth decade of life, the future of the dynasty became an
urgent question. The story that explained how the matter was resolved featuresa
Buddhist monk, a feud between magicians, and the bloodline of the Ly family, three
prominent elements in the minds of educated people at that time.
Another aspect of this is that Ly Can Duc designated a crown prince in late 1117
only two months after the death of his mother, Lady Y Lan. Lady Y Lan exercised
strong influence over Ly Can Duc to the end of her life. Five months before her
death, she complained to her son about the depredations of water buffalo thieves
and he responded by prescribing a series of punishments for such people. After her
death, three other palace women were buried with her remains, punctuating what
in effect was a revolution in the palace, making way for the mother of the next
king. Lady Y Lan had inhibited a resolution of the succession question.

The deaths of two other high-ranking people in1117, shortly before the death
of Lady Y Lan, may also have had implications for the naming of a crown prince.
They were both Ly noblemen with the rank of marquis, among the brothers and
uncles of Ly Can Duc, although the exact relationships are unknown. In1104,
during a royal audience, one of them had publicly struck the other with the ivory
tablet held by noblemen during royal audiences at court; these symbols of rank
were about a meter long and just wide enough to be held in the palm of one’s
hand. No additional information was recorded about the incident, so it remains a
mystery, but the attacker was the same man who had hired Dai Dien to kill Tu
Dao Hanh’s father in the story about Tu Dao Hanh, suggesting that he may have
been a rival of the Sung Hien Marquis, with whom Tu Dao Hanh was allied.
That he was easily angered and quick to act suggests a man of definite views who
was likely to have had a stake in the naming of the crown prince. Perhaps the
deaths of the two antagonists of1104 removed options with which Lady Y Lan
had involved herself but that were opposed by other members of the Ly family, in
particular the Sung Hien Marquis and others who were willing that his son, Ly
Duong Hoan, be made crown prince.
One option that was ostensibly taken seriously was Giac Hoang, the strange
boy who came from outside the royal family. Lady Y Lan, who came to the court
as an outsider and who resorted to mass murder to push her way into the Ly
aristocracy, may have favored Giac Hoang or others like him. Her well-known
devotion to Buddhism may have led her to consider spiritual achievement super-
ior to a royal bloodline in selecting the next king.
A dominant theme during the remaining history of the Ly dynasty, which
lasted for another century, was a struggle to draw a boundary around the royal
family to distinguish those eligible to be king from those who were not. Except
for the childless Ly Can Duc, the practice of multiple queens, along with hosts of
royal concubines, produced several potential kings in every generation. The
political logic of the Ly experiment in government was based on marriage
alliances with other powerful families who provided queens, the potential
mothers of kings. Ly Nhat Ton had resorted to designating the son of a peasant
girl as his heir. This was accepted because there was no other plausible alterna-
tive, but Ly Dao Thanh’s effort to maintain the fiction of Ly Can Duc’s adoption
into the clan of the senior queen succumbed to Lady Y Lan’s homicidal ambition.
Four decades later, Ly Can Duc, apparently under the influence of Lady Y Lan,
wished to make Giac Hoang the crown prince. Giac Hoang came as if having
sprung from the sea, without a mother or any family at all. He did not threaten
Lady Y Lan’s dominant position among the palace women. Senior Ly noblemen
foiled this scheme, and five of them offered their sons for consideration instead.
Ly Duong Hoan was chosen from among these five Ly offspring just three

months after Lady Y Lan’s death. His mother, Do Thanh Anh, would be a strong
influence in the palace until her death in1147. Her kinsman, Do Anh Vu, would
dominate the court from the late1130s until his death in1159.
Do Anh Vu and To Hien Thanh
Just as his father had sought to re-enact his grandfather’s expedition to Champa
after designating him as crown prince in the 1060s, Ly Can Duc, after his
mother’s death and the settling of the succession question, showed an uncharac-
teristic exuberance by personally leading an army in the field for the first time in
his life. In1119, after great preparation and accompanied by signs and wonders,
Ly Can Duc led his soldiers to attack people in the mountains surrounded on
three sides by the great curve in the Da River, a major affluent of the Red River,
in the modern province of Hoa Binh. In his proclamation announcing the exped-
ition, Ly Can Duc charged the leader of these people with raiding, plundering,
and ignoring royal authority. The object of the expedition was around seventy
kilometers west of Thang Long, twice that distance by boat upriver. The cam-
paign was a great success.
One man who may have taken the opportunity of this expedition to demon-
strate his abilities to the king and thereby advance his status at court was Le Ba
Ngoc. He first appears in records as a palace eunuch in1114. He had risen to a
mid-level position by 1118, at which time he was demoted to a clerical post
under unrecorded circumstances. Beginning in 1121, he received a series of
promotions and advanced rapidly in rank. In1125, he led an army against Nung
rebels in Cao Bang and thereafter became the ranking military commander. At
the time of Ly Can Duc’s death in1127, he was entrusted with guarding the
palace and ensuring Ly Duong Hoan’s accession. He was the dominant figure at
court until his death in1135.
Le Ba Ngoc’s success came from insinuating himself into the family of the
crown prince’s mother, Do Thanh Anh, by adopting as his son one of her
kinsmen named Do Anh Vu. According to written records, Do Anh Vu was a
brother of Do Thanh Anh, but inscriptional evidence suggests that he was more
likely her cousin. In1124, at the age of10, Do Anh Vu was brought to live at the
court and became a companion of the crown prince Ly Duong Hoan, who was
two years younger than he. Do Anh Vu was reportedly a handsome and lively lad
skilled in singing, dancing, and playing games.
The court did not linger in mourning after Ly Can Duc’s death. After only
twenty-two days, the new11-year-old king began to hold court on the same day
that he witnessed the palace women being burned on Ly Can Duc’s funeral pyre.

This sweeping away of women in the palace put a definite end to the regime of
Lady Y Lan, who had initiated her control of the palace by doing away with
women of aristocratic status. Royal women and highborn women of families at
court now regained control of the inner palace.
One of Ly Duong Hoan’s first acts was to elevate his mother to the rank of
queen mother and to eliminate tax obligations for one hundred members of her
family. Within two months, two royal consorts were designated. One was from
the royal family and was named queen. The other was a daughter of Le Ba
Ngoc’s nephew and was given a lower rank. The hierarchy of palace women was
the dynasty’s spine. In 1131, even their distinctive hairstyle was forbidden to
other women in the kingdom.
One of the men sent to announce Ly Can Duc’s death to the parents of the new
king was Do Thien. The only other surviving information about this man is that
he wrote a book of history. The book has not survived, but it was cited in a
fourteenth-century compilation for several stories that celebrate historical figures
famous for loyal service to their sovereigns, a theme that Le Ba Ngoc and Do Anh
Vu cultivated to justify their exercise of power in Do Thien’s time.
Ly Duong Hoan’s relatively short reign (1127–1138) was a time of major
change in the strategic environment of the region. In the1120s, the Song dynasty
was driven from northern China by the Jin dynasty, which originated in Man-
churia and was led by people called Jurchen, ancestors of the Manchus who
conquered China in the seventeenth century. Thereafter, the Southern Song
dynasty was ruled from Hangzhou in south-central China. Constantly threatened
by its northern neighbor, Southern Song was a relatively weak dynasty that
posed little potential threat to Thang Long. This significant reduction in pressure
on the northern border is an underlying reason why Ly dynastic politics became
increasingly diffuse and troubled during the twelfth century. The fate of the Ly
dynasty was closely connected to the fortunes of Southern Song, for the necessity
to maintain strong leadership at the Ly court faded away along with the sense of
danger from the north.
On the other hand, this was in the time of the greatest conqueror to rule the
Khmer kingdom of Angkor, Suryavarman II, whose reign began in1113 and
lasted into the1150s. During much of this time, Suryavarman II dominated the
Chams, and allied Khmer and Cham armies attacked across Thang Long’s
southern border in1128,i n1133,i n1135, and in1137. Each time, Viet armies
mobilized and successfully repelled the invaders. The border nevertheless
remained unstable for many years with chronic raids, Cham princes seeking
asylum, and Cham slave merchants seizing local people to sell at Angkor.
In 1138, Ly Duong Hoan lay on his deathbed at the age of22. It is recorded
simply that he was“unwell.” Two years earlier he had suffered a severe illness

that resisted all cures until he was miraculously made well by a monk named
Minh Khong who had been the favorite disciple of Tu Dao Hanh. According to
the story, Tu Dao Hanh had forewarned his disciple that after he was reincar-
nated as the next king he would be ill, and he asked that Minh Khong cure him
when that came to pass. According to an inscription, Ly Duong Hoan’s fatal
illness began in1137. Apparently, the king had a weak constitution and was not
expected to live long.
Ly Duong Hoan had three sons, aged6, 2, and1. He intended that his eldest
son should succeed him, and the implications of this for the family and allies of
that son’s mother are likely to have been an increasingly important factor in
court politics. However, on his deathbed he was visited by three of his wives who
pled with him to designate his second son instead because the mother of his eldest
son was of a lower status than the mother of his second son, being only a
concubine, and she would become jealous and bring harm to them if her son
were made king. Here we see the shadow of Lady Y Lan’s murderous rampage in
1073. The dying king acknowledged the justice of their appeal and accordingly
named his second son, Ly Thien To, as his heir. One of the three wives, Le Cam
Thanh, was Ly Thien To’s mother. She was from a high-ranking family claiming
paternal descent from Le Hoan and maternal descent from the Ly royal family.
When Ly Duong Hoan died, Do Anh Vu immediately stood up to exercise
actual power in the name of the child king, Ly Thien To. Do Anh Vu became the
lover of Le Cam Thanh, Ly Duong Hoan’s widow and Ly Thien To’s mother,
and he stood at the head of the court for the next two decades. Do Anh Vu had
accompanied an army sent in1135 to expel Cham and Khmer invaders on the
southern border, and his career shows close attention to military affairs. A major
challenge to his ascendance at Thang Long materialized within a year of Ly
Duong Hoan’s death. In1139, a man named Than Loi, identified in Vietnamese
records as a sorcerer, appeared in the northern mountains. He posed as an
abandoned son of Ly Can Duc and laid claim to the throne, proclaiming himself
king. Chinese records tell of a man at this time claiming to be the son of a
concubine rejected by Ly Can Duc. He asked the Southern Song for assistance
but the emperor refused to be involved. Than Loi gained a reputation for
supernatural powers and gathered a large following from the lowlands as well
as from the border regions and the mountains. He concentrated his forces in the
foothills of modern Thai Nguyen Province about seventy kilometers north of
Thang Long, and defeated all armies sent against him.
When Than Loi marched against Thang Long, Do Anh Vu personally led an
army out to attack him. Than Loi suffered a crushing defeat and escaped back
north to the mountains to assemble new forces. After displaying the heads of
dead rebels for many kilometers along the roads north of Thang Long, Do Anh

Vu marched out to attack Than Loi along the upstream of the Cau River, in
modern Thai Nguyen Province. He captured two thousand of Than Loi’s fol-
lowers, but Than Loi fled toward the Song border. One of Do Anh Vu’s lieuten-
ants, To Hien Thanh, pursued Than Loi and captured him in modern Lang Son
Province. Than Loi and his most prominent followers were beheaded in Thang
Long. Other captives received various punishments depending upon the measure
of guilt assigned to them. They all received pardons a year later.
The Than Loi episode suggests rather serious disaffection with the Thang Long
court. What it has in common with previous and later moves against the dynastic
regime is that it originated from outside the circle of royal blood and of those
who posed as guardians of that circle. The rupture of that circle when Lady
Y Lan swept out the highborn women of the palace in1073 was a haunting
memory for later generations of nobles. The Ly dynasty was based on alliances of
aristocratic families, among which the Ly were preeminent. But over time, in the
absence of strong adult kings, competition among these families for precedence
at the Ly court played out among the palace women following the vicissitudes of
giving birth to an heir, and this gradually began to pull the dynastic system apart.
Meanwhile, men like Do Anh Vu guarded access to the palace and supervised
the government. The campaign against Than Loi is the first mention of To Hien
Thanh in the records. To Hien Thanh, probably a kinsman of Do Anh Vu’s wife,
who was from the To family, was Do Anh Vu’s protégé and most trusted
assistant. After Do Anh Vu’s death in1159, To Hien Thanh stepped into the
role of guarding the dynasty for another twenty years, until his death in1179.
Four laws proclaimed in1141 give a glimpse into the rural economy. They
show that the royal court was concerned with disputes over the ownership of
fields, orchards, and ponds. The laws specified the difference between a mortgage
and a bill of sale; a mortgage could be redeemed or litigated under certain
conditions but a bill of sale was final. They also protected the ownership rights
of people bringing abandoned fields or orchards under cultivation for one year
without anyone disputing their claim. Anyone disputing ownership of fields or
ponds with weapons and killing or injuring another person lost any claim to the
disputed property. Violation of these laws earned eighty strokes of the rod.
These laws do not have any discernible applicability to the relatively stable regime
of large ecclesiastical and aristocratic estates that were typical of the Ly dynasty and
that dominated the rural economy of the Red River plain from the tenth century into
the early thirteenth century. However, we know that in the twelfth century lands
along the coast where the Red River meets the sea were being desalinized and
brought under cultivation. This is the modern province of Thai Binh where in the
early thirteenth century the Tran family rose up to penetrate the systemof Ly politics
and found a new dynasty. Do Anh Vu’s family estates were located on the Thai Binh

frontier downriver from Thang Long, and he was surely interested in promoting the
extension of agriculture into the tidelands.
The 1141 laws were concerned with buying and selling lands and with litigat-
ing disputes over land ownership, problems typical of an emerging rural econ-
omy on an expanding agricultural frontier, which is what Thai Binh was at that
time. In1144, another law was published specifying that anyone relying upon
family power and influence in a dispute over fields, ponds, and property was
subject to eighty strokes. Judicial concern then shifted from disputants to cor-
ruption, for in the following year yet another edict prescribed sixty strokes for
judges who unlawfully used coercion in settling litigation.
Economic expansion along the coast at this time attracted foreign trade. In
1149, merchant ships from Java and what is modern Thailand arrived asking to
trade. A seaport was established at Van Don, on what today is called Quan Lan
Island off the coast north of the Red River plain, where local products were
exchanged for goods from overseas. Merchants from Southern Song were prom-
inent at Van Don, which became part of a thriving trade route from China down
the coast to what is now Thailand, Sumatra, and Java, with connections to
islands further east and to India in the west. Van Don was thereafter an import-
ant entrepôt for more than three centuries.
Do Anh Vu was particularly concerned with military authority and the loyalty
of the palace guard, for this was his main defense against enemies both in the
countryside and at court. In1143 he instituted a new regime of training and
discipline for the army. As the Than Loi affair demonstrated, without a strong
adult king, the Ly court was vulnerable to pretenders.
In 1144, a man from Song crossed into the border province of Cao Bang and
proclaimed that he had received an imperial mandate to govern An Nam. He
attracted a large following from the peoples in the mountains and along the
border. Song border officials asked Thang Long to capture and extradite him.
A Viet army attacked the rebels and captured many followers of the imposter,
who escaped back into Song territory where he and his entourage were captured
by Song border guards. Recognizing five of those captured as rebel chieftains
owing allegiance to the Ly, Song officials returned them to Thang Long for
justice. The Sino-Vietnamese border had become a relatively well-policed frontier
with the Song and Ly courts cooperating to maintain order.
A more immediate danger to Do Anh Vu was disaffection in the palace guard,
for as the young king, Ly Thien To, grew from childhood to adolescence he
became a focus of loyalty for those who were alienated from Do Anh Vu. In
1145, an edict specified that in selecting men to fill vacancies in the palace guard,
local officers were to select men from large, powerful families and were not to
select orphans. The reason for this was that someone without a family would be

more susceptible to a conspiracy than someone with a prominent family to
guarantee his loyalty. Furthermore, the families indicated here were aristocratic
allies of Do Anh Vu.
Nevertheless, many at court detested Do Anh Vu’s adultery with the queen
mother. TheComplete Book of the History of Great Vietrecords his reputation
for cruelty and his arrogance in“sitting as emperor in the hall of audience while
belligerently daring anyone to oppose him.” It also records that “servants,
officials, and officers... ” gestured with their chins and exchanged glances; they
all looked askance at what was happening but dared say nothing.” Perhaps
barriers to Do Anh Vu’s enemies were removed by the deaths, in the mid
1140s, of Do Anh Vu’s kinswoman, the queen dowager, and of Mau Du Do,
an influential official at court who had supported both Le Ba Ngoc and Do Anh
Vu since the death of Ly Can Duc nearly twenty years before.
In 1149, a conspiracy broke out in the palace guard, which imprisoned Do Anh
Vu and appealed to the young king. Do Anh Vu’s enemies temporarily gained
control of the court and he was exiled to a village outside of Thang Long. Within
a short time, however, the queen mother, Le Cam Thanh, had mobilized her allies to
secure his return to court. Do Anh Vu organized and trained a personal guardof five
hundred men and used it to seize his enemies and have them killed. After these
events, the young king reportedly fell ill and regained his health only after Do Anh
Vu re-enacted a famous episode from the life of the Duke of Zhou, celebrated in
Confucian texts as the model for those ruling on behalf of young kings, in which he
prayed that the king’s illness be placed upon himself. What lay behind the perform-
ance of this historical cliché is unknown, but Ly Thien To remained docile for the
rest of his life.
In 1150, the daughter of a paternal cousin of Do Anh Vu named Do Thuy
Chau became a queen of Ly Thien To and during the next several years gave
birth to several sons, thus ensuring the continued ascendance of Do Anh Vu and
his family at court. Opponents of Do Anh Vu nevertheless tried once more to
bring him down.
In early1159, an envoy returned from the Song court and reported the practice
of a box being placed in the palace courtyard to receive anonymous messages
addressed to the Song emperor. He requested that this practice be instituted at
Thang Long, and the king agreed. After a month, the box was opened and a
message was found that accused Do Anh Vu of plotting to seize the throne. Do
Anh Vu said that this was surely the work of the person who had suggested to
emplace the box, and so the king exiled that person to an outpost in the
mountains where he was compelled to drink poison. Perhaps this last effort of
Do Anh Vu’s enemies was emboldened by intimations of his mortality, for within
a few months of this episode, Do Anh Vu died. He was buried with great honors.

To Hien Thanh, his trusted assistant and wife’s kinsman, immediately picked up
the reins of government.
Later historians condemned Do Anh Vu for his adultery with the queen mother,
but they evaluated To Hien Thanh highly, praising his principled leadership and
incorruptibility. To Hien Thanh maintained the level of leadership established by
Do Anh Vu in campaigning successfully against Champa and suppressing rebels to
protect the borders and maintain the peace. In his time there were literary exams to
select civil and military officials, and he discouraged the proliferation of palace
eunuchs by forbidding self-castration; these measures were litmus-test issues for
Confucian historians in later centuries. Furthermore, in 1174, Thang Long
achieved a major diplomatic success when Viet envoys persuaded the Song
emperor, against the arguments of some of his advisors, to promote the status of
the Ly king in the imperial hierarchy of vassalage from King of Giao Chi Prefec-
ture, the title first given to Dinh Bo Linh, to King of An Nam Kingdom.
What earned To Hien Thanh his greatest appreciation from later historians
was his resistance to the schemes of the queen mother, Le Cam Thanh, during the
royal succession of1175. As the ranking woman at court, she commanded
considerable authority. When, in1149, the palace guard had imprisoned her
lover, Do Anh Vu, she bribed his jailors and returned him to power. In the early
1170s, the crown prince, Ly Long Xuong, was around20 years old. Information
about his mother has not survived, but the queen mother had fixed her hopes on
him, and she exercised a strong influence over him. According to what has been
recorded, her love of intrigue blighted Ly Long Xuong’s prospects because she
underestimated To Hien Thanh’s loyalty to the king, Ly Thien To, her son.
The king grew to hate the crown prince because the youth made a point of having
affairs with all of his favorite women. The queen mother, for reasons not recorded,
took exception to a particular favorite of the king named Lady Tu and wanted to
alienate the king from her. To this end, she secretly introduced Ly Long Xuong into
Lady Tu’s chamber and endeavored to have the lady fall in love with the prince,
thinking that this would cause the king to abandon her. When Lady Tu told the king
about this, the king angrily demoted Ly Long Xuong and replaced him as crown
prince with Ly Long Trat, who was less than2 years old. This occurred in1174.
The queen mother was not reconciled to this turn of events, and, when the king
died a year later, she repeatedly tried to put Ly Long Xuong on the throne, first
by bribing To Hien Thanh, then by banqueting court officials, and finally by
trying to bring Ly Long Xuong into the palace with an entourage of his follow-
ers. To Hien Thanh stood fast to the dead king’s decision and refused all bribes.
The court officials all remained loyal to him and ignored the queen mother’s
appeal. When Ly Long Xuong attempted to enter the royal compound, court
officials barred the way and advised him that, if he did not desist, the palace

guard would be called. The queen mother did not cease her conspiracies on Ly
Long Xuong’s behalf until1182, after he had become a leader of bandits. She
lived to a fine old age, dying in1200.
To Hien Thanh’s presumed loyalty to the wishes of Ly Thien To in protecting
the accession of Ly Long Trat was probably not as important as his loyalty to the
network of friends and associates that he inherited from Do Anh Vu. The mother
of the child who was put on the throne by To Hien Thanh in1175, the new
queen mother, was Do Thuy Chau, a kinswoman of Do Anh Vu. Her brother Do
Anh Di became second-in-command to To Hien Thanh.
When To Hien Thanh died in1179, Do Anh Di succeeded him as the dominant
person at court. He did not have the moral stature of To Hien Thanh, who
apparently persuaded others with appeals to what was thought to be correct.
Instead, he instilled in others a fear of him personally, which led to a breakdown
in government functions and became the object of public jokes made onstage at the
Thang Long opera. Grim humor during his ascendancy may have been exacerbated
by a famine in1181 that reportedly carried away more than half the population.
Perhaps because of the lowering of respect for authority after the death of
To Hien Thanh, there was a particular emphasis on education and the next
generation of leaders, starting with the small king. Within weeks of To Hien
Thanh’s death, the king, Ly Long Trat, and his mother observed children of temple
officials competing to read a Buddhist sutra and a competition of lads in poetry and
mathematics. They also attended an examination in which children of Buddhists,
Confucians, and Daoists competed in writing poetry and rhyming prose and were
tested on their knowledge of classical books, moral principles, and practical
sciences such as making calculations and organizing transportation. A course of
instruction was instituted for the king and a program of public education wasbegun
to teach the people about filial piety and loyalty to rulers. In1185,a ne x a mo ft h o s e
15 and older with knowledge of poetry and history resulted in selecting thirty for
further study. These exams were presumably held to identify talent for assignments
at court, but there is no information about people coming through these exams
occupying positions of significance. Despite these educational activities, later
historians viewed Ly Long Trat as a hopeless playboy with no interest in govern-
ment, and they dated the beginning of the collapse of the Ly dynasty from this time.
Collapse of the Ly dynasty
After Do Anh Di’s death in1188, his assistant Ngo Ly Tin attempted to direct
affairs but became the object of public humor instead. Ngo Ly Tin was a soldier
who rose to prominence in the early1180s, first by suppressing the banditry that

had reached the level of rebellion under the leadership of the disgraced crown
prince Ly Long Xuong, and then by leading an expedition into the mountains of
modern Laos. In1189, the court was in some disarray due to the influence of
Mac Hien Tich, who was the lover of the queen mother, Do Thuy Chau. Court
officials obtained an order from the16-year-old king for Ngo Ly Tin and another
official to investigate Mac Hien Tich, but these two were afraid of him and
nothing was done. A song was sung in the streets of Thang Long comparing the
two ineffectual men to a pair of famous idiots in the city at that time.
The situation changed rapidly in1190, beginning with the death of the queen
mother. Bereft of her protection, Mac Hien Tich was exiled to a distant outpost in
the mountains. Within a few months Ngo Ly Tin died and was succeeded by Dam
Di Mong. Dam Di Mong was a kinsman of a general whose daughter had entered
the palace in1186 and who in1194 gave birth to Ly Sam, the last Ly king. Dam Di
Mong was the leading figure at court for the next quarter-century. Later historians
described him as uneducated, without guile, lacking backbone, and indecisive.
This characterization of Dam Di Mong might encourage an identification with
the palace guard officer of the same name who in the coup of1150 had prevented
his fellows from killing Do Anh Vu immediately upon arresting him, arguing that
they should follow proper procedure. If indeed this was the same person then he
must have lived to a very old age. Dam Di Mong never exercised the dominant
position held by Le Ba Ngoc, Do Anh Vu, To Hien Thanh, or even Do Anh Di.
This was not simply due to his lack of personal quality. It was also due to the
breakdown of the Ly political system, based initially on the personal charisma of
kings and then increasingly on the swords of the families of aristocratic women
brought into the palace.
Lady Y Lan’s challenge to this system was mitigated by the emergency of the
Song War, but her dominant influence in the palace and Ly Can Duc’s lack of an
heir froze any practical consideration of the future of the dynasty for over forty
years. By the time of her death, Ly nobles had mobilized a consensus about how
to proceed. However, without strong adult kings, able and ruthless men with
high connections in the hierarchy of palace women became the leaders of the
dynasty. Any powerful family could aspire to have their women enter the palace
and give birth to a king, and the competition for this opportunity gradually
superseded attention to the actual business of governing. Dam Di Mong was the
first strongman to attain pre-eminence on the expectation of his kinswoman
giving birth to a prince rather than on the actual birth of such a prince. The
prejudice in favor of child kings, easily controlled by their adult mentors, had
made this increasingly likely as time passed. During Dam Di Mong’s era, the Ly
court disintegrated into open warfare among powerful families based in various
regions of the Red River plain.

In the1190s, Dam Di Mong appeared to demonstrate a certain level of energy
putting down rebellions in the southern provinces and in the region just north-
west of Thang Long. He also inspected the performance of officials to decide
whether they should be promoted or demoted, and exams were held on the
“three religions” of the Buddhists, the Confucians, and the Daoists and to select
scholars to teach the king. Nevertheless, he perceived that the authority of the
court was fading, and he decided that the Buddhist temple population had
become too large and unresponsive to the monarchy. In1198, Dam Di Mong
blamed the Buddhist monks for subverting public morality. He told the king that
monks were as numerous as the working population, flocking together in groups
to indulge in drunken orgies, sleeping during the day and carousing all night. He
accordingly gathered the monks and defrocked most of them, tattooing their
hands to permanently mark them.
Dam Di Mong’s purge of the monks did not stop the spread of disorder. That
same year,1198, rebellion again broke out in Nghe An led by someone claiming to
be a descendent of Dinh Bo Linh. This rebellion was suppressed, but the following
year floods and famine spread over the land, and in1200 the court was distributing
food to the starving. In1202 an official in charge of the monks addressed the king in
response to the popularity of Cham music at court, which was sad and mournful,
making listeners weep with emotion. He quoted from a classical text,“Preface to the
Odes,” about how the sounds of a disordered kingdom are plaintive, lamenting,
angry, and resentful. He then described the present time:“The people rebel, the
kingdom is in distress, the ruler pursues pleasure without limit, government is in a
state of anarchy, the hearts of the people are perverted.” His conclusion was that the
current fashion in court music was“an omen of ruin.”
The following year, the30-year-old king, Ly Long Trat, unimpressed by the
“omen of ruin,” embarked on a vast project to build a complex of more than ten
palaces, some with upper stories and towers, surrounded by ponds and gardens.
For the next three years he entertained himself there, playing games and carous-
ing with his eunuchs, women, and favorites. To pay for these pleasures, he
opened his hand to bribes, which led to royal decisions being made by the highest
bidder. Gangs of robbers sprang up and spread through the countryside, opening
the way for the ambitions of rebel leaders. Construction of the palaces caused
much distress among the people. A bird built a nest in an uncompleted tower and
was viewed by some as an evil omen, but a eunuch persuaded the king that it was
a good omen. Dam Di Mong’s efforts to maintain some modicum of order in the
kingdom were to no avail. At one point, Dam Di Mong whipped another official
in an altercation over the construction schedule and was publicly denounced to
the king. This led to a brief period of symbolic demotion for Dam Di Mong to
appease his enemies.

An episode on the Cham frontier is an indication of how things had changed
from previous eras when Ly armies kept a close border watch. A Cham prince
appeared with several hundred armed men in some two hundred boats on the
coast of modern Ha Tinh Province, just north of the border. He claimed to be
fleeing from enemies in his own kingdom and had come to ask for help. Dam Di
Mong went south to investigate. Fearing that“an anthill can break a dike,” he
advised local officers to beware the strangers and to maintain guard against
them. The local officers scoffed at his caution and asked how there could be
anything to fear from people fleeing trouble. Angered by their attitude, Dam Di
Mong left them to their own devices and returned to Thang Long. Belatedly, the
local officers began to fear treachery and planned to attack the Chams. Hearing
of this, the Cham prince struck first, ambushing and defeating local forces, killing
the local leaders, and plundering the region before returning south.
A rebellion broke out at Hoa Lu and armies sent against it were repeatedly
defeated. Dam Di Mong built a defensive wall to contain the rebels and mobil-
ized expert archers from the northern uplands to lead an attack, all to no avail.
By1207, two other major rebellions had also broken out, one based at modern
Son Tay, west of Thang Long, and one at modern Hai Duong, east of Thang
Long. Ly Long Trat was sufficiently sobered by the situation that he allowed an
edict to be published apologizing for his misrule, promising to“make a new
beginning with the people,” and saying that all the land and merchandise that
had been confiscated by officials would be returned.
In a more prosaic vein, Dam Di Mong and Pham Binh Di, the eunuch who had
erased concern about the bird ’s nest in 1203, marched against the most
threatening rebellion, led by Doan Thuong, the leader of Hong Province in the
region of modern Hai Duong, fifty kilometers east of Thang Long. As the king’s
men approached, Doan Thuong requested that he be allowed to surrender to
Pham Du, a prominent man in Khoai Province, a neighboring locality to the
southwest. Money was passed from Doan Thuong via Pham Du to Ly Long Trat,
who consequently ordered Dam Di Mong and Pham Binh Di to withdraw their
troops. As a result of this, Pham Binh Di acquired an intense hatred of Pham Du
for outwitting him in the game of royal sycophancy.
Pham Binh Di was the leader of Dang Province, fifty kilometers down the Red
River from Thang Long at modern Hung Yen, southwest of Khoai, which was
the bailiwick of Pham Du. The feud between these two men was about access to
the king, which had to do with streams of money. Pham Binh Di had gained
access to the palace through castration. Despite efforts to ban the practice, during
the Ly dynasty, men submitted to self-castration as a way to get into the palace.
Ly Thuong Kiet is only the most famous of such cases. Sometimes, as with Pham
Binh Di, these men had wives and children and were prominent leaders in their

localities. Pham Du was apparently not a eunuch, but he was very successful in
gaining the king’s ear because of the wealth he channeled to the king. It was the
manner in which he gained his wealth that offered Pham Binh Di an opportunity
to openly oppose him. The competition of these two men for the king’s favor was
the catalyst for an outbreak of violence that pulled the Ly court apart and
brought Ly Long Trat’s reign to an end.
The court was endeavoring to recruit soldiers to fight the increasing numbers
of rebels and bandits. When the king appointed Pham Du to be in charge of the
southern border region in modern Nghe An and Ha Tinh, Pham Du requested
and received the king’s permission to recruit an army of personal soldiers. Pham
Du quickly became a notorious robber baron and his soldiers became expert
bandits. This encouraged an outbreak of banditry and rebellion that paralyzed
communications and transportation in the kingdom. Pham Du organized a
network of marauders allied with Doan Thuong in Hong.
In 1208, amidst floods and famine, Pham Binh Di received a royal commission
to attack Pham Du’s allies south and east of Thang Long. Pham Du returned from
the southern border and joined with Doan Thuong against Pham Binh Di. After
months of fighting and repeated setbacks, Pham Binh Di finally defeated Pham Du
in1209 and proceeded to inventory and confiscate or destroy all of Pham Du’s
considerable property. However, when he went to report to the king, Pham Binh
Di was detained under arrest in a palace, for Pham Du had arrived before him and
brought the king to his side. Hearing of this, Pham Binh Di’s general Quach Boc
broke down a gate into the palace intending to rescue his leader. But before he
could do so, Pham Du slew Pham Binh Di. Pham Du and the king fled as Quach
Boc went on a rampage, retrieving Pham Binh Di’s corpse and taking the15-year-
old crown prince Ly Sam, along with his younger brother, his mother, and his two
sisters, before hastening downriver for refuge with allies of Pham Binh Di.
The most powerful of Pham Binh Di’s allies was Tran Ly, grandson of a man
named Tran Kinh, who had come from Fujian Province in China. Tran Kinh had
arrived when the opening of new lands and a quickening of trade with Southern
Song and Southeast Asia had stimulated an expanding economy, attracting
people with an eye for opportunity to the Red River’s coastal region. Tran Kinh
reportedly started out as a fisherman, but by the time of Tran Ly the family
owned vast estates, commanded soldiers, and dominated the coastal region of the
Red River. Tran Ly had married into the To family, and his wife’s brother, To
Trung Tu, was a powerful ally; whether these people were related to To Hien
Thanh is not known, but such would be a plausible conjecture. Tran Ly had three
talented adult sons, Tran Thua, Tran Tu Khanh, and Tran Thu Do, all of whom
would be prominent in coming events. Another of his assets was daughters,
potential mothers of kings.

The arrival of Quach Boc with the crown prince suddenly expanded the
horizon of Tran Ly and To Trung Tu. Dam Di Mong, along with other members
of the court appeared on the scene, following the winds blowing his kinswoman,
the mother of Crown Prince Ly Sam. In a series of events orchestrated by To
Trung Tu, Ly Sam and a daughter of Tran Ly, later known as Thuan Trinh, were
married, and Ly Sam was proclaimed king.
Meanwhile, Ly Long Trat had rallied his followers and regained Thang Long.
He sent Pham Du to join with Doan Thuong to attack Tran Ly and To Trung Tu.
Pham Du, distracted by a princess, missed his pre-arranged rendezvous with
Doan Thuong and was captured by men who sent him to Tran Ly, who killed
him. Tran Tu Khanh, Tran Ly’s second son, then mobilized Tran and allied
forces and attempted to seize control of the capital, but a sudden storm scattered
his boats and he lost over three hundred men to Thang Long’s defenders.
After this, those who had gathered with Tran Ly and To Trung Tu to make Ly
Sam king were dismayed, and many crept back to Thang Long, including Dam
Di Mong, who endured a public rebuke, but nothing more than that, for his lack
of loyalty to the king. In1210, Ly Sam returned to Thang Long as the crown
prince, leaving his Tran wife behind. Soon after, bandits killed Tran Ly, and,
shortly after that, the king fell sick and died. When a clique of warlords opposed
the accession of Ly Sam, To Trung Tu attacked and defeated them and was
accordingly given a high rank at court by the new king. Of course, Dam Di Mong
was given the leading position at court, now that his kinswoman was indeed the
queen mother.
There followed six years of intrigue and fighting. Beneath the surface of
seemingly random violence was a consideration that had become the basic
principle of Ly dynastic politics and that motivated the combatants. It was a
struggle to the death for the possibility of one’s kinswoman becoming the mother
of a king. The Tran had struck first with the marriage of Ly Sam and Thuan
Trinh, but the queen mother was determined not to allow the Tran clan to gain a
foothold in the palace. Her efforts to do away with Thuan Trinh would not reach
the level of homicidal fury until1216 when a pregnancy signaled the potential
imminence of a crown prince’s birth and moved Ly Sam to the most decisive act
of his life. Until then, the hopes and fears of many men led them from battlefield
to battlefield. Without a strong decisive king or a dominant court master, there
was nothing for the men of the kingdom but to fight the matter out among
themselves.
It was not until To Trung Tu had gained a strong position at court in the
spring of1211 that the Tran sent Ly Sam’s wife to Thang Long. However, within
a few weeks, To Trung Tu was dead, struck down by the husband of a princess
with whom he was having an affair. The queen mother then shifted the influence

of the court behind the most formidable enemy of the Tran, Doan Thuong in
Hong, who had been charting his own course since1207.
Tran Tu Khanh, Queen Thuan Trinh’s brother, accordingly attacked Hong.
The fighting was long and bitter. At one point Tran Tu Khanh broke the dikes
and flooded large parts of Hong. At another point, Doan Thuong was invited to
Thang Long where he was feted and granted high titles. After a significant
victory, Tran Tu Khanh arrived at the capital hoping that his battlefield deeds
would translate into access to the court, but the queen mother refused him entry.
To emphasize her point, she had Thuan Trinh demoted in the hierarchy of palace
women. Tran Tu Khanh saw nowhere to go but back to the battlefield. The
fighting continued through1212. Ly Sam was so discouraged that he had to be
talked out of retiring to a monastery. In early1213, royal armies were sent to
attack Tran Tu Khanh. The queen mother plotted to seize Tran Tu Khanh’s
mother, matriarch of the To family, who had entered the palace when her
brother To Trung Tu had been ascendant. Tran spies heard of it and Lady To
escaped downriver.
Dam Di Mong raised armies and joined Doan Thuong against Tran Tu Khanh.
Tran Tu Khanh fended them off and even captured Nguyen Non, the Ly general
in charge of a region centered on the modern city of Bac Ninh, thirty-five
kilometers northeast of Thang Long. Nguyen Non’s bold demeanor and lack
of fear were so impressive that Tran Tu Khanh made him a son-in-law and gave
him a command. However, within a year, Nguyen Non became the most implac-
able enemy of the Tran family, greatly complicating its ambitions.
The year 1214 began with an all-out attack on Thang Long orchestrated by
Tran Tu Khanh. Defeated everywhere, Ly Sam and his mother fled to Lang Son
on the northern border, and the last information recorded about Dam Di Mong
is his departure to seek help from Doan Thuong. Doan Thuong could do
nothing, for Tran Thu Do, the third Tran brother, had just ravaged his home
province of Hong. Tran Tu Khanh sent messengers to Lang Son inviting the king
back to Thang Long. The queen mother said no. She and the king, abandoned by
all their followers except for around thirty guardsmen, wandered through the
mountains waiting for a turn in events.
Tran Tu Khanh, giving up on Ly Sam and his intransigent mother, tried to raise
another prince to the throne in Thang Long, but this merely provoked Nguyen
Non at Bac Ninh and others to turn against him. In exasperation he plundered and
burned the palaces. The king and queen mother then emerged to place themselves
under the protection of Nguyen Non. By the time Nguyen Non fought his way into
Thang Long, the entire city had been looted and burned to ashes by Tran Tu
Khanh. Thang Long having become a battlefield, the king and his mother took
residence in a thatched house built beside a shrine outside the city.

Fighting between Tran Tu Khanh and Nguyen Non went back and forth
through 1215 with Tran Tu Khanh facing upstream, Nguyen Non facing down-
stream, and Thang Long the center of attention. With the king and queen mother
was the residue of the Ly court, noblemen susceptible to the spies and bribes of
both sides. At one point, Ly Sam shaved his head to be a monk, but the press of
events and the appeals of his entourage did not allow him that luxury. A thatched
palace was built on the western edge of Thang Long and by early1216 Ly Sam
and the queen mother were holding court. The queen mother had become a
partisan of Nguyen Non while Ly Sam was pulled toward reconciliation with the
Tran under the influence of his wife. Tran Tu Khanh endeavored to show a
friendly face by returning some of the royal loot he had taken. In spring1216,L y
Sam asked Tran Tu Khanh’s help against an obstreperous nobleman who was
resisting his authority, and Tran Tu Khanh obligingly attacked the man, who fled
to Nguyen Non.
The most fateful event at this time was that Thuan Trinh, Ly Sam’s Tran wife,
was pregnant, and the queen mother wanted to do away with her. The queen
mother commanded Thuan Trinh to commit suicide, but Ly Sam intervened. She
sent poisoned food to Thuan Trinh, but Ly Sam kept his wife with him constantly
and had her eat only from his own bowl. The queen mother’s homicidal schemes
finally alienated Ly Sam from her. What began as a turning point in the mind of
Ly Sam became a turning point in the morass of violence that had engulfed the Ly
dynasty. When the queen mother sent a draught of poison with servants
instructed to force Thuan Trinh to drink it, Ly Sam stopped them, and that night
he took his wife and sought refuge with the soldiers of Tran Tu Khanh stationed
near the palace. The22-year-old king and his wife were quickly passed along up
the chain of command to be welcomed with great joy by Tran Tu Khanh at his
headquarters downriver from Thang Long. The queen mother found refuge with
Nguyen Non.
Ly Sam’s flight from Thang Long in the summer of1216 violated the principle
that kings obeyed and belonged with their mothers, which had governed the Ly
court since the time of Lady Y Lan. This principle had become increasingly
disconnected from actual events, despite its hold on the minds of the politically
alert. Without his mother and her men, Ly Sam would either have to be a leader
in the mould of the first three Ly kings or he would have to disappear. He was
not a leader. His one decisive act had come out of desperation, at best, not
conviction. He was now in the hands of the men who led his wife’s family.
If one is inclined to favor the stereotypes of Ly Sam as irresolute and of Tran
Tu Khanh as implacable, it might be tempting to imagine that the story of Ly Sam
seeking refuge with the Tran to protect his wife was conjured by Tran historians
to sanitize some less romantic event. In that case, one might conjecture that Tran

agents forcibly took Ly Sam captive while rescuing one of their women, possibly
pregnant with a future king, from homicidal schemes. Such might be thought to
be more in keeping with the general atmosphere of the times as recorded in
surviving annals. However, without further information, such would also be to
choose the fatalism of violence over the possibility of the human spirit breaking
out in unexpected ways. Whatever was going through the mind of Ly Sam as he
and Thuan Trinh hastened through the night, be it a naïve sense of escape or a
despairing sense of entrapment, the remaining ten years of his life were an agony
of powerlessness as he watched the men of his wife’s family fashion a new
regime.

3 THE TRAN DYNASTY
Tran Thu Do
The Ly family was based in the upper plains of the Red River where they enjoyed
direct control of what was then the agricultural core of the country. The Tran
family viewed matters from the perspective of the coast, which by the mid twelfth
century had become part of a lively network of foreign trade stimulated by the
economy of Southern Song. The port of Van Don was a gathering place for
merchants and travelers from the coasts of southern China and elsewhere.
Here, local products found a market and foreign goods were available. Wealth
accumulated in the hands of producers, traders, officials, and those who were
politically and militarily ascendant, namely the Tran. The founding of the Tran
dynasty brought a new perspective to Thang Long, linking it more directly to the
economy and culture of Southern Song than was possible by any overland
connection. It was the result, however, of a long and violent struggle during
the second and third decades of the thirteenth century. Nguyen Non and Doan
Thuong partitioned the Ly dynastic heartland and resisted the upriver advance
of the Tran.
Possession of the king gave the Tran an advantage that they were quick to
exploit. Within days of finding protection with her brother Tran Tu Khanh,
Thuan Trinh gave birth to the princess Thuan Thien. A thatched palace was
quickly built on the southern edge of Thang Long for Ly Sam, the king. Thuan
Trinh was elevated to the status of queen. Tran Tu Khanh, his eldest brother
T r a nT h u a ,a n dT r a nT h u a’s eldest son Tran Lieu, then 5 years old, all
received prestigious court appointme nts. Reinforced by men who followed
the king, Tran Tu Khanh resumed his attacks on the two local strongmen
who were his chief enemies, Nguyen Non at Bac Ninh and Doan Thuong at
Hai Duong, pushing both men back and putting them on the defensive.
An effort to present a façade of royal normalcy was undertaken in1217

with the king’s birthday festival, replete with a five-peak bamboo mountain
and outings for the king to watch fishermen.
In 1218, a second daughter, the princess Chieu Thanh, was born to the queen.
The king reportedly began to suffer from epileptic fits and to act irrationally.
Whether this was an actual illness, an expression of sadness, or a flourish of
Tran historians to indicate incompetence is hard to say. In the events leading to
his death, during1225 and 1226, there is nothing to suggest that he was not in
good health at that time.
Fighting with Nguyen Non and Doan Thuong continued. Tran forces gained
the upper hand in battle but could not eliminate these old foes. In1218, Tran
Thua broke dikes to devastate Nguyen Non’s territories with floodwater, but
Nguyen Non remained undefeated. Meanwhile, Tran Tu Khanh sent men to
secure the southern provinces and the Cham border. He also sent patrols into
the northern mountains to bring over to his side the chieftains there. Nguyen
Non and Doan Thuong were too weak to threaten the Tran outside of their
home districts but strong enough that the Tran preferred to avoid forcing the
issue. They were neighbors, and the Tran found ways of keeping them at odds
with each other. With possession of Thang Long and of the monarchy, the Tran
had more urgent matters to address.
In 1223, Tran Tu Khanh died. His younger brother, Tran Thu Do, immedi-
ately stepped forward. For the next quarter-century he was the actual ruler of
the country and the architect of a new dynasty. The elder brother, Tran Thua,
was given formal precedence and did take an active part in government. But
Tran Thu Do always had the last word. In1224, Tran Thua was on the southern
border pacifying rebels in Nghe An while Tran Thu Do was in the palace
attending to court affairs.
Tran Thu Do was determined to ease Ly Sam off the throne and did so with
the expedient of having him abdicate in favor of his second daughter, Chieu
Thanh, then7 years old. Ly Sam’s eldest daughter, Thuan Thien, then9 years
old, was passed over because she had already been married to Tran Thua’s eldest
son, 14-year-old Tran Lieu. Tran Lieu had been introduced into the court in
late 1216 at age 5 to be the playmate and eventual husband of Thuan Thien,
born six months before. However, Tran Thu Do did not view Tran Lieu as a
plausible king and instead favored Tran Thua’s second son Tran Canh. Chieu
Thanh and Tran Canh were the same age. At the end of1225, Tran Thu Do
brought Tran Canh into the palace and arranged for the two children to be
married, making Tran Canh king and his father, Tran Thua, the“senior king.”
Ly Sam and his mother were sent to a temple in Thang Long. Within a year,
worried that latent loyalties to the Ly dynasty might focus on the retired king,
Tran Thu Do induced Ly Sam’s suicide. Tran Thu Do then took Ly Sam’s queen,

his half-sister Thuan Trinh, as his own wife, for he dared not entrust a woman
of her status to any other person. The death of a queen dowager was recorded
in1230, which can only have been Ly Sam’s mother. All the remaining women
of the defunct Ly court were married to upland chieftains.
Nguyen Non continued to be a thorn in the side of Tran Thu Do. In1228,
Nguyen Non killed Doan Thuong and took possession of all his lands, people,
and treasure. In combining the resources of the two remaining anti-Tran regions,
Nguyen Non was in a position to launch a serious challenge to the new dynasty.
Tran Thu Do reinforced his defenses and sent a letter to Nguyen Non appointing
him to a high rank along with a Tran princess to be his wife, hoping that she and
her entourage would be able to maintain close watch on him. However, Nguyen
Non isolated her from his household and took for himself an even grander
rank. But only three months later he fell ill. When Tran Thu Do sent members
of his entourage to visit him, Nguyen Non made a great effort to appear strong
and healthy, eating and riding his horse, but he died shortly after.
Nguyen Non’s second-in-command was a Cham slave who had previously
been a merchant in Laos and was famed for his mastery of weapons and of
battlefield strategy. Much of Nguyen Non’s success was attributed to him.
Some Vietnamese historians have pointed out that Nguyen Non’s home region
included the estates of the Ly royal family where large numbers of Cham
prisoners were settled after the expeditions of1044 and 1069 and that this
gave a distinctive cultural and linguistic character to Nguyen Non’s ambitions.
It is commonly thought that Nguyen Non’s long and successful resistance to the
Tran was in some measure a result of his use of cavalry, which the relatively
elevated and hilly terrain of his region made practical. After Nguyen Non’s
death, his Cham lieutenant galloped off on horseback to no one knew where,
and the Tran, after nearly twenty-five years of war, finally stood unchallenged
in the Red River plain.
In 1226, the new king, Tran Canh, celebrated his birthday festival, following
a tradition that had been initiated by Le Hoan two and a half centuries before.
In1227, the Tran revived the annual oath of loyalty to be taken with a draught
of blood by their men at the shrine of the mountain spirit where Ly Phat Ma had
begun this practice after his accession in1028. In these ways, the Tran continued
some ritual practices of kingship from the previous dynasty. However, the Tran
had participated in the long and painful disintegration of the Ly dynasty and
were determined to learn from that experience. The lesson they took from the
Ly failure was the importance of maintaining the integrity of the Tran family by
ensuring that the mothers of future kings be Tran women. The only exceptions
to this were Ly Sam’s daughters, who had been absorbed by marriage into the
Tran family at an early age and thereby separated from the Ly.

In 1232, determined to have done with any nostalgic intrigues among the Ly
aristocracy, Tran Thu Do arranged that a ceremony for Ly noblemen to honor
their ancestors be held in a hall prepared over a deep pit. In the midst of the
ceremony, when all were drunk with banqueting, he collapsed the floor and
buried them alive. After this, the Ly family, for the most part, ceased to exist.
Some members of the Ly royal family fled across the sea and found refuge with
the Koryo dynasty of Korea, where their descendents maintained a memory of
their royal past into modern times.
Once he had finally erased the likelihood of any resurgence of loyalty to
the Ly, Tran Thu Do began to worry about who would be king in the next
generation. The next king’s legitimacy would be difficult to challenge if his
mother was Chieu Thanh, former child queen and the king’s consort. In the
mid 1230s, however, Chieu Thanh remained childless. On the other hand, her
elder sister, Thuan Thien, had already given two sons and a daughter to the
king’s elder brother, Tran Lieu. In1234, the death of Tran Thua, father of both
Tran Lieu and the king Tran Canh, left Tran Thu Do free to solve the problem in
his characteristically callous style. In1237, Tran Thu Do and the mother of the
two young women, now his wife, decreed that Tran Canh abandon his wife and
take the wife of his brother, who happened to be three months pregnant.
One year earlier, Tran Lieu had suffered a reduction in his rank for having
been intimate with a former concubine of the Ly court. Now, suffering the
humiliation of being deprived of his wife, he went into rebellion. Tran Canh,
dismayed by the turn of events, rebelled in his own way by running away to a
temple on Mount Yen Tu, some120 kilometers east of Thang Long, begging to
be allowed to abdicate and become a monk. Unable to persuade the19-year-old
king to return to the capital, Tran Thu Do began building a palace complex
around the temple where the king had taken refuge, saying that wherever
the king happened to be was where the capital would be. This was too much
for the Buddhist patriarch at the temple, a former teacher of Tran Canh, who
told the young king to go back to the capital before the precious solitude of
the temple was ruined.
A couple weeks after Tran Canh had returned to Thang Long, Tran Lieu,
despairing of his prospects as a rebel, eluded Tran Thu Do’s men by pretending
to be a fisherman and approached the king’s boat to ask for mercy. The two
brothers embraced and wept. Tran Thu Do, in a nearby boat, came rushing over
and ordered his men to“Kill that rebel Lieu!” Tran Canh clung to his brother
and refused any harm to him. Tran Thu Do was angry and reportedly said,“Ia m
nothing but your dog! How can I know what’s going on between you two
brothers?” Tran Canh spoke to calm down Tran Thu Do and asked him to
withdraw his soldiers. Tran Thu Do grudgingly complied but made sure that

everyone who had followed Tran Lieu in his rebellious adventure was tracked
down and killed. Tran Canh assigned his brother a fief where he lived quietly
until his death in1251. Five years later, one of the sons that Thuan Thien had
borne Tran Lieu, harboring resentment at the treatment of his father, took his
family and dependents and attempted to escape to Song China. He was captured
and returned by an upland chieftain who was loyal to Thang Long.
Tran Thu Do’s policies opened fears of a feud within the Tran family. Some
thought that Tran Lieu, as the eldest son of Tran Thua, should have been king.
These people looked for a champion in another son that Thuan Thien had borne
Tran Lieu, the man later to be famous as commander-in-chief of all military
forces during the Mongol invasions of the1280s, Tran Quoc Tuan (later known
as the Hung Dao Prince, or Tran Hung Dao). Tran Quoc Tuan was able and
bold. Because of this, and because of the wrong done to his father, relations
between him and the king, his uncle, were strained.
Tran Quoc Tuan famously tried the king’s patience in1251 when, at the age
of 19, he broke into the house of a Tran prince whose son had been promised
the hand of the king’s daughter in marriage. The princess had been sent to reside
in the household of her future father-in-law. Tran Quoc Tuan, enamored of
the princess, his half-sister, surreptitiously entered her bedchamber at night and
carried her away. He was spared punishment and allowed to keep the girl, who
was at most in her early teens, only through the intervention of his aunt, the
king’s full sister, who had raised him as her son after his father’s rebellion
fourteen years before.
In 1240, Thuan Thien bore the king a son, Tran Hoang, who became the
crown prince. In order to knit the two sides of the family together, a daughter
that Thuan Thien bore Tran Lieu, Princess Thien Cam, became the queen of
Tran Hoang, her half-brother. She subsequently became the mother of the next
king, Tran Kham. Tran Kham’s queen was his cousin, a daughter of Tran Quoc
Tuan, who became the mother of the next king, Tran Thuyen. Tran Thuyen took
as queen a granddaughter of Tran Quoc Tuan, but her failure to bear an heir
would, among other things, lead to a breakdown in the Tran marriage policy
in the fourteenth century. What the Tran had learned from the failure of the
Ly dynasty is that mothers of kings must come from within the royal family.
This rule was the initial basis for the Tran dynastic experiment. So long as it
functioned, the Tran dynasty remained strong.
The Tran policy to exclude other families from the palace was consonant
with centralizing policies in other areas as well. In 1228, village leaders in
Thanh Hoa, notoriously difficult to govern, were instructed to conduct annual
censuses to update population registers that distinguished people of different
ages, abilities, states of health, and family status as a basis for military

conscription and recruitment of officials. This was the first recorded effort
by rulers in Thang Long to connect theirauthority directly with villages in a
southern province. Three years later, perhaps building on this, a canal was dug
to connect Thanh Hoa with the Ca River plain further south. In1234, Tran
Thu Do took direct personal responsibility for Thanh Hoa, an indication that
after settling matters in Thang Long he directed his attention to the southern
provinces. In 1238, he approved the population registers of Thanh Hoa after
four years of work.
In 1242, a new scheme of jurisdictions was established for the entire
kingdom. Groups of officials responsible for each jurisdiction were sent to
categorize villages according to their sizes and to establish population registers
indicating how much land, if any, was owned by each family and the amount
of taxes to be paid accordingly. This is the earliest surviving evidence of a
centralized land tax regime being proclaimed by a royal court at Thang Long.
Nevertheless, the differences between the Red River plain and the southern
provinces were great and in1256 the kingdom was divided for certain pur-
poses into two categories. The Red River plain and the people there were
called Kinh, meaning“capital.” The southern provinces of Thanh Hoa and
Nghe An, which at that time also included the modern province of Ha Tinh,
and the people there were called Trai, meaning“garrison” or “outpost.” The
Tran instituted an unprecedented centralization of authority in both areas,
but relied primarily on the Kinh people for soldiers and taxation, since they
were most numerous, most accessible to the capital, and most socialized to
respond to authority. The distinction between Kinh and Trai people gave rise
to the usage, still current today, of referring to the Vietnamese as Kinh in
contrast to other ethnic groups in the country. The Trai people can plausibly
be associated with ancestors of the various groups of people categorized as
Muong in modern times.
Within the Red River plain, the dynastic regime built by Tran Thu Do
expressed the rising power of the coast based on trade and land claimed from
the sea. The Tran homeland was in the region of the modern city of Nam Dinh.
The most stubborn enemies of the Tran were based in the upper plains in the
Bac Ninh and Hai Duong areas, which had been the heartland of old Giao
Province. While the Ly had looked from Thang Long across the river to their
home estates in that old heartland, the Tran made the river a pulsing artery
connecting Thang Long with their second royal palace complex near Nam Dinh,
which was connected in the other direction with the international commerce
centered at the seaport of Van Don. This is an example of change and vitality
breaking into old centers from frontier areas, a theme prominent in Vietnamese
history as it also is in the histories of many other countries.

Early Tran literati
The Tran did not simply replace the Ly but fought for many years to destroy the
local powers that had been an aspect of the Ly system of government. While
the Ly presided over a coalition of powerful local families, the Tran made sure
that members of the royal family were in dominant positions everywhere. This
was practicable only with a cadre of educated commoners to serve the Tran
nobles. The need for administrative personnel led the Tran to develop a system
for recruitment based on the model of civil service examinations in Song China.
The Ly dynasty had held occasional examinations to select people with skills in
demand at court, most commonly with little more than knowledge of letters for
reading and writing. In addition to this, a small cadre of scholars was needed to
serve as palace teachers and as envoys to the Song dynasty. Most of the educated
people in the Ly dynasty were Buddhist monks or classical scholars who
were also Buddhists. This began to change in the thirteenth century under the
influence of educational ideas about curriculum and examinations for govern-
ment service that had developed in Song China and were brought to Thang Long
by the Tran. This curriculum began to produce men with a more secular sense of
moral cultivation based on relatively rational ethical principles and hierarchical
human relationships. Devotion to deities or the cultivation of spiritual know-
ledge and of supernatural powers did not cease among educated people but
rather declined and came under more critical scrutiny.
The first recorded mention of the new curriculum comes from1253 when
Confucian scholars were summoned to teach“the Four Books and the Five
Classics” at a newly built palace academy. In1272, a search was made for scholars
to teach the king about“the Four Books and the Five Classics.” The Five Classics
(Changes, Odes, Rites, History, and theSpring and Autumn Annals) were standard
texts that had been studied for centuries by ancestors of both the Song Chinese
and the Vietnamese. However, the Four Books (Great Learning, Doctrine of the
Mean, Analects of Confucius, and Mencius) came into prominence only from
the time of the Song philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200), the architect of what is
sometimes called Neo-Confucianism.
In 1232 and in1239, examinations were held at the capital with a total of nine
people being selected in those years. These exams were for“advanced students,”
but they did not follow the system of awarding academic degrees that was later
viewed as standard. One of those selected in1232 was Tran Chu Pho, who is
known to have written a book of history that no longer exists but was used by
later historians. His other claim to fame was to be an object of public laughter
during a royal banquet in1242 when everyone was drunk and taking turns to

sing songs; he stood up to sing but could only murmur over and over:“What
I will now sing is... What I will now sing is... ” The few people selected in these
exams were most probably used as teachers and as consultants in relations with
Song China.
In 1246, a new system for examinations was established that began a stan-
dard format for awarding degrees to successful candidates. In1247, the first
examination under this new academic regime was held and forty-eight men
were graduated. Similar exams were held in1256, 1266,a n d1275,p r o d u c i n g
forty-three, forty-seven, and twenty-se ven graduates, respectively. Thus, in
thirty years, 165 men were produced by these exams. Most of these graduates
were from the Red River plain. The only examination to record the number of
Kinh and Trai graduates is that of1256. In that year, only one of the forty-three
graduates came from the southern provinces.
The men who participated in these examinations presumably had the advantage
of coming from families able to educate their sons and of being recommended
by members of royalty. Many of these men were descendents of immigrants from
the north who maintained family traditions of learning. The examination system
provided an avenue for such people to gain public attention and opportunities
for advancement in service to royalty. These men did not receive appointments in
a bureaucratic structure of government, for such did not exist. If not assignedto
pedagogical, scholarly, or consulting tasks in palace offices, they were assigned
to the entourages of noblemen to assist with the miscellaneous tasks of adminis-
tering various localities. Two men of that time who are remembered as historians
represent these contrasting experiences.
One of the graduates of1247 was Le Van Huu (1230–1322), who in1272
presented to the throne a book of history from early times to the end of the Ly
dynasty. Although this book no longer exists as Le Van Huu wrote it, it was used
in compiling the official court chronicle in the fifteenth century, which preserves
Le Van Huu’s comments on various historical events. Beginning with Zhao To
in antiquity and continuing through the period of the Ly dynasty, his comments
critique what he regarded as laudable, disorganized, improper, or immoral
conduct by historical figures and reveal a strong Confucian bias. He spent his
long life in Thang Long as a palace erudite.
Le Trac was a man of learning in the entourage of Tran Kien. Tran Kien’s
father, Tran Quoc Khang, was a son of Tran Lieu, but born after Tran Thu Do
sent Tran Lieu’s wife to Tran Canh. Tran Quoc Khang was adopted as a son by
Tran Canh and remained loyal to the throne throughout his life, but his son Tran
Kien nurtured the resentment of his grandfather, and in1285, while on campaign
in Nghe An, he surrendered the army he was leading, along with his family,
dependents, and entourage, to the Mongols. Le Trac surrendered with him.

When Mongols escorted this group north to China, local chiefs prepared an
ambush at Chi Lang, a strategic pass on the watershed over the highlands into
Lang Son Province. With those lying in wait was a slave of Tran Quoc Tuan,
Tran Kien’s uncle and commander of the Tran armies. The slave, a marksman
with the bow and arrow, recognized Tran Kien and shot him dead. Le Trac
retrieved the body of his patron and escaped on horseback. He spent the rest of
his life in China where, in the early fourteenth century, he compiled a history of
“An Nam” that still exists today.
After 1275, no examinations are recorded until1304, apparently because of
the disruptions of the Mongol Wars. The165 men selected during the examin-
ations of the mid thirteenth century were but the peak of a mass of literate
officials serving at all levels of dynastic affairs. In1228 all officials were tested
to compile a register for ranking them. A royal audience for students passing an
exam was recorded in1236, and on that occasion rules and regulations for
lower-level exams were established. Also in that year a school was established
for the sons and younger brothers of“literate” officials and of officials who
“follow,” two categories of people apparently meant to include all those in the
entourages of Tran noblemen, both the literate and the illiterate. In1261,a n
examination was held in writing and mathematics for applicants seeking
appointments in officialdom. In1267, an examination in writing was held for
people to be given official appointments. In1274, people specifically identified as
Confucian scholars were selected to teach the crown prince. There were also
examinations in the“three religions” of Buddhism, Daoism, and Confucianism
recorded in 1227 and in 1253. These examinations continued an educational
tradition from earlier times and apparently selected people to supervise Buddhist
and Daoist temples.
In 1253, a shrine was built at Thang Long with statues of the Duke of Zhou, of
Confucius, and of Mencius, along with pictures of seventy-two of Confucius’
disciples. This is reminiscent of the shrine built in1070 with statues of the Duke
of Zhou, of Confucius, and of Confucius’ seventy-two disciples. In 1156,D o
Anh Vu had built a shrine for Confucius, an indication that the1070 shrine no
longer existed in his time. The1156 shrine apparently perished when Thang
Long was looted and burned in the last years of the Ly dynasty. In1253, the
addition of Mencius reveals the influence of Song Neo-Confucian thought, which
put particular emphasis upon the Mencian idea that everyone had the potential
for goodness if properly educated. This shrine was part of the palace academy,
already mentioned, which was established to teach the“Four Books and Five
Classics,” the new curriculum from Song China.
Despite formal attention to a curriculum of study and a system of academic
examinations, men resorted to other means to gain promotion as well. One

scholar secretly used incantations to advance his career, which, when revealed,
provoked the king to veto his appointment to the royal academy. Full of resent-
ment, he joined the Mongols during their invasion of1287–1288 and was
subsequently beheaded as a traitor when captured by the Tran.
Solidarity among the princes
The Tran kings and princes were exceptionally well educated, and not only in the
Confucian classics. They were also trained in Buddhism, and they were great
builders of temples and stupas. Tran Canh read widely in the Buddhist sutras and
the writings of Chan (Japanese Zen, Korean Soen, Vietnamese Thien) masters of
the Tang dynasty, particularly Huineng (638–713). Tran Canh was an original
thinker, abreast with Buddhist thought in Song China, and he developed an
inclusive view of various currents in Buddhism. He wrote many sermons and
essays during his lifetime that were subsequently compiled asKhoa Hu Luc
(Instructions on Emptiness). His grandson, Tran Kham, followed his deep
engagement with Buddhist thought and practice and became the founder of a
royal sect of Buddhism, the Truc Lam (Bamboo Grove) School.
Tran Canh’s writings moved beyond the miscellany of devotional, thaumatur-
gical, and meditational practices that had characterized the Buddhism of the Ly
dynasty and earlier. Similar to the way Confucian studies were reoriented by
trends in Song thought, Tran Canh’s writings express a distinctive response to
issues in Song Chan Buddhism. In the late eleventh century, the monk and
patriarch Thong Bien (d.1134) had propounded a distinction between the
“scriptural school” and the “mind school,” a divide that was typical of Song
Buddhist thought. At issue was whether one achieved enlightenment gradually
through the study of books or suddenly by meditative intuition.
Tran Canh moved beyond such dichotomous conundrums toward a sense of
the unity of all things and all beings. The Tang Chan patriarch Huineng, who
taught that all sentient beings were endowed with the Buddha nature, was an
important influence on his thought. Tran Canh believed that all perceivable
phenomena were parts of a single underlying unity in the mind of Buddha and
that the highest wisdom transcended all distinctions. This idea,“not-two” (bat
nhi; Chinese bu’er; Sanskrit advaita), meaning “non-separation,” is generally
translated into English as“non-duality.” An emphasis on non-duality is promin-
ent in the poems of the monk Tue Trung (1230–1291), who was Tran Kham’s
teacher, and is characteristic of Tran thought generally. Among members of
royalty, the idea of non-duality tended to be conflated with a sense of family
solidarity and of unlimited power over the country.

Tran princes had a strong sense of ownership over every aspect of the kingdom
and were unwilling to distinguish between themselves and the people and prop-
erty over which they ruled. They resisted any tendency to affirm separation,
division, or alienation from the realm in which they were masters. We see this in
successive generations of adherence to a marriage policy designed to heal the
wound between the brothers Tran Lieu and Tran Canh. Tran Canh’s protection
of Tran Lieu against Tran Thu Do’s wrath was an act against the duality, or
irreconcilable separation, expressed in this feud. On the other hand, Tran Kien’s
choice to avenge his grandfather’s humiliation with the separatism of a traitor
earned him an arrow of death, for what was not in harmony with the group
could not be allowed to exist.
The relatively strong sense of solidarity among the Tran princes was expressed
by Tran Hoang when, as king, he addressed a gathering of his royal kin in spring
1268. His words were recorded as follows:
All that is in the world is nothing but the realm of our ancestors, and it
is only right that the elder and younger brothers of our royal house
together enjoy the riches and honors that are the inheritance of our
ancestors. Although outwardly there be but one person on the throne to
receive the world’s respect, yet inwardly you and I are the bone and
flesh of the same womb. If there is something to worry about, we worry
together; if there is something to be happy about, we are happy
together. You must all pass these words on to your sons and grandsons
so they will never forget them, for only then will our royal house have
good fortune for ages to come.
Tran Hoang’s emphasis on solidarity was surely aimed at ameliorating the
volatile relations among his royal kin and uniting them under his authority.
In typical Tran fashion, the matter was not left at the level of words. The king
followed up his remarks with a decree that whenever there was a royal audience,
his kinsmen were to remain after everyone else was dismissed and go with him
into the inner palace to eat and drink together and afterwards to bring out a long
pillow and a large blanket for them all to sleep together,“in order to have true
feelings of brotherly affection.” At the same time, a strict hierarchy was to be
observed among the royal kin at public occasions. The result of these policies,
according to later court chroniclers, was that at that time all the royal kinsmen
were united in mutual harmony and respect and none was arrogant or disdainful
toward another.
In reality, as already noted, there were many tensions among these men, and
the emphasis upon solidarity was surely intended to lessen the dangers of this.
Aside from the accumulation of resentments produced by escapades such as Tran
Quoc Tuan’s stealing away the bride of a kinsman, there remained the founding

feud of the royal house between the“senior line” of Tran Lieu and the“junior
line” of Tran Canh. Marriage policy and habits of friendship could not entirely
push this feud out of sight. A remarkable indication of this is an episode recorded
from the Mongol invasion of1285 as the royal entourage fled from the enemy.
Tran Quoc Tuan carried a wooden staff with a sharp iron point. Since dissatis-
fied members of the“senior line” considered that the throne rightfully belonged
to him, the king’s men kept a sharp watch upon him, afraid that he might stab
the king. When he realized this, he discarded the iron point from his staff.
A famous exception to Tran solidarity was Tran Ich Tac, a son of Tran Canh
who, when growing up, was extraordinarily bright and competitive, good at
everything and particularly known as an expert chess player. It was said that he
had sent a letter to the Mongols via merchants at Van Don requesting that they
come to make him king. When they came, he went over to their side with his
entourage and dependents; three other men with their dependents went with him,
one of whom had been an envoy to the Mongols in1263. Tran Ich Tac subse-
quently spent the rest of his life at the Mongol court as the“King of An Nam.”
Annalists recorded a story to explain his treason. At the time of Tran Ich Tac’s
birth, he had announced himself to Tran Canh in a dream, saying that he was a
northern prince being punished by his sovereign for misbehavior; he would be
reborn as Tran Canh’s son and later would return north. Reincarnation was a
common explanation for otherwise unaccountable behavior.
Considering the magnitude of the Mongol challenge that would test the Tran
house, and considering the number of people who eventually failed the test of
loyalty, the degree of solidarity among Tran leaders was nevertheless remark-
able. This was not by chance but grew from the spirit of inclusion and reconcili-
ation that was the hallmark of Tran Canh’s personality, religious sensibility,
philosophy, and policy. His son and grandson, Tran Hoang and Tran Kham,
who stood at the head of the Tran family during the Mongol invasions of the
1280s, imbibed his attitude and understood that the fortunes of their dynasty
depended upon the unity of the royal house, preferably mobilized willingly with
a spirit of group solidarity but enforced by coercion if necessary.
Poetry and language
Tran kings and princes were trained to appreciate and write poetry in the form of
“regulated verse” that had developed during the Tang dynasty (jintishi in Chi-
nese, “new style prosody”). Very few poets during the Ly dynasty mastered this
form, but in the Tran dynasty it became the dominant mode. Ly dynasty poetry
was mostly written by Buddhist monks and tended to focus upon abstract

religious thought. However, Tran dynasty poetry celebrates the beauty of the
natural world, the joys and sorrows of human life, and the remembrance of
events. The poems were written in Literary Chinese following complicated and
difficult tonal and rhyme schemes. The skill of being able to express a scene or an
emotion in poetry was a way of processing individual experience into a form of
knowledge accessible to others in writing. The discipline required to do this was
understood as a mark of being civilized. The many Tran princes who wrote and
enjoyed poetry shared a realm of aesthetic appreciation.
The writing of vernacular poetry began at this time. The court chronicle says
that an official at court in the1280s named Nguyen Thuyen was the first to write
poetry in the vernacular. None of his poems has survived, and no vernacular
poetry at all has survived from before the era of Ming dynasty rule in the early
fifteenth century when vernacular writing was collected for destruction. Ver-
nacular writing, called Nom (written with a character that means“gibberish”
but is usually glossed as“southern speech”), used Chinese characters in various
ways to represent Vietnamese words. One common way of Nom usage was to
use a character for its sound. Another common way was to invent a Nom
character by combining elements of two Chinese characters, one to mark sound
and one to mark meaning. The use of Nom was facilitated by prior knowledge of
Literary Chinese characters and of their pronunciations in the vernacular lan-
guage. Consequently, it was a writing system designed to maintain the élite’s
monopoly on literacy or, according to a once well-known aphorism, for the
amusement of retired scholars.
The preface for a dictionary compiled no later than the seventeenth century
claimed that Nom had existed in various forms since the time of Shi Xie in the
early third century as a pedagogical aid for students studying literary texts. But
its use to write poetry in the thirteenth century was an aspect of the emerging
class of educated commoners, the most prominent of whom won recognition in
the mid-century examinations. That these people began to use Nom for writing
poetry shows that vernacular sensibilities were being brought into the realm of
literacy to an unprecedented degree. It also suggests that, prior to this time, there
was a high degree of bilingualism among educated people, who were for the most
part from the aristocracy.
Some, if not all, Tran family members were bilingual in the thirteenth century.
In 1282, Tran Quoc Tuan was able to pose as a Chinese monk in an interview
with a Yuan dynasty envoy. Tran Ly, Tran Canh’s grandfather who had led the
Tran family into court politics, was the grandson of an emigrant from Fujian.
The Tran were based on the coast near the entrepôt of Van Don where Chinese
language, cuisine, and style of dress were the currency of social and business
relations. Whether the family had ever maintained contact with kin in Fujian is

unknown but nevertheless plausible, for the Tran dominated the coast where
trading connections with China produced wealth.
Many of the educated commoners coming into the entourages of Tran noble-
men in the mid thirteenth century were bilingual, though some may at best have
mastered the high-register language of Literary Chinese and not necessarily
spoken Chinese. For them, writing vernacular Vietnamese poetry opened a
literary community based on the idioms of their experience as students struggling
upward into the governing class. Spoken Chinese gradually died out among
upper-class people during the Ly and Tran dynasties as an aspect of the process
of linguistic shift in which bilingualism gave way to a monolingual vernacular
pattern of speech, thereby bringing into being the Vietnamese language through
infusions of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical particles.
Mobilizing resources: eunuchs, slaves, dikes, and war
An important class of people at court was eunuchs. As had been the case during
the Ly dynasty, Tran eunuchs were typically the products of self-castration. Some
young men took this route to gain access to the palaces and to the powerful
people in them. An example of someone becoming a eunuch was recorded in
1254when Tran Canh, on an excursion into the city, saw a student who looked
exactly like a person that a divine being had pointed out to him in a dream as
deserving a senior appointment in his entourage, which was reserved for
eunuchs. Tran Canh paid the boy a large sum of cash to be castrated and to
enter his service as a eunuch. Eventually, this eunuch proved his worth and was
promoted to reach the high position indicated in the king’s dream.
Eunuchs served in many capacities. In1231, a eunuch was sent to supervise the
digging of a canal to link the provinces of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. In1280,
when Tran Canh was hailed in the street by someone seeking justice against the
brother of a powerful official of whom judicial officers were afraid, he had a
eunuch investigate the matter and thereafter placed eunuchs in charge of hand-
ling such cases. Confucian scholars generally disdained eunuchs, considering
them a pestilence of intrigue and corruption, and some tension between the
two groups also existed at Thang Long, as demonstrated in an episode from
1288, which nevertheless was recorded with a happy ending in keeping with the
Tran court’s emphasis on harmony.
A feud had erupted between the scholar in charge of the office that prepared
proclamations and the eunuch whose task it was to read out the proclamations in
public. The proclamations were written in Literary Chinese, but the eunuch’s
knowledge of Literary Chinese was rudimentary, so in order for him to read out

the proclamation before an audience at court he needed sufficient time to study it
beforehand. The feud between the two men reached a point that on one occasion
the scholar decided to keep back a proclamation until just before the court
session at which it was to be read. The result was a public scandal with the
eunuch being unable to read the proclamation. Afterwards, the king took the
eunuch aside and said:“This man is a scholar. You are a eunuch. You both
watch over the royal capital and are mere worms to me. Send him some oranges
as a present and the two of you will give gifts back and forth. What is the
problem?” Thereafter, the two antagonists reportedly became good friends.
As the king’s blunt words made clear, both scholars and eunuchs were
members of the royal entourage and neither had any base of power or support
outside of royal favor. There was no choice for them but to get along. But it was
significant that it was the eunuch whom the king pulled aside for a reprimand.
Eunuchs belonged to the king in a way that scholars did not. Scholars had their
own families and friends beyond the palace, but it was difficult for a eunuch to
exist outside of the king’s entourage.
Another class of people was slaves. These could be peasants who sold them-
selves into slavery to improve their lives, or prisoners of war, or people from
other lands brought by merchants. They served many functions from manual
laborers to skilled craftspeople. As time went by, Tran princes accumulated
increasing numbers of slaves. During the Mongol Wars, many military units
were composed entirely of slaves. In the thirteenth century, slavery was not a
particularly bad fate. Slaves were generally well cared for and, in wartime, served
their masters loyally. The condition of slaves, and also of peasants, would change
dramatically for the worse in the fourteenth century when, lacking the kind of
leadership provided by the first three kings, Tran government faltered.
The infrastructure of transport, communication, and water control was cen-
tralized to an unprecedented degree in the thirteenth century. The canal built in
1231connecting the southern provinces of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An has already
been mentioned. In that same year, Tran Thua ordered that statues of Buddha be
built in all the rest houses so travelers could worship while on the road. In1244
the kingdom was divided into jurisdictions and officials were sent to establish a
base in each of them for transporting goods. Transportation and communica-
tion, as in the past, were mostly by boat. In1248, a system of dikes was designed
for defense against floods in the Red River plain. A cadre of officials was tasked
with maintaining these dikes. Owners of land lost to dike construction were
compensated in cash by the court. In1255, an official was sent to oversee dike
construction throughout Thanh Hoa Province. Previous dike construction was
done locally or regionally. Royal interest in building and keeping watch over
dikes throughout the kingdom began from this time.

By 1250, the Tran court had mobilized the human and material resources of
the Red, Ma, and Ca River plains to a degree of central direction never before
achieved. Tran Canh was then32 years old. He had been king since the age of7.
He had a 10-year-old crown prince, Tran Hoang. His uncle, Tran Thu Do,
architect of the dynasty, was57 years old and still strong. Following the example
of Ly Phat Ma and Ly Nhat Ton, Tran Canh expressed the exuberance of his well
being by an expedition to the Cham capital of Vijaya.
In the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, Cham rulers were in large
measure subservient to Jayavarman VII, one of the great kings of Angkor, under
whose direction Khmer and Cham armies had pushed north against the faltering
leadership of the Ly dynasty. By the1220s, this era of Khmer ascendancy had
passed and Cham kings regularly sent tribute to Thang Long. The Tran court
was nevertheless irritated by demands for its recognition of Cham authority in
disputed border territories in modern Quang Binh Province that each side
claimed but neither controlled. Even more irritating were periodic raids along
the southern coast by people whom the Tran believed to belong to the Cham
king. Consequently, to display Tran power on the southern coast, in1252 Tran
Canh personally led an expedition to sack Vijaya. Departing Thang Long at the
beginning of the year, he returned at the end of the year with much plunder and
many captives, including the wives and concubines of the Cham king. The two
kingdoms were thereafter at peace for many years, and they even became allies
during the Mongol Wars of the1280s.
The First Mongol War
The situation on the northern border became volatile as Southern Song power
faded under the blows of Mongol invaders. Conditions on the Song border
deteriorated to the point that tribute goods could not be sent to the Song court
because of bandits. Then, in late1240, officials on the border in Lang Son
Province reported that“northern people” had raided and plundered the prov-
ince. A year later, Tran Canh sent soldiers by land to attack Song border
jurisdictions. He himself led a naval force in small boats to attack up the rivers
in the same Song coastal jurisdictions that Ly Thuong Kiet had attacked in1075,
at modern Qinzhou and Hepu. The aim of these attacks was to clear away bandit
lairs on the Song side of the border and to advise Song border officials that
incapacity to control disorderly conduct from their side would not be matched by
Tran passivity. In1242, after further campaigning along the border by a Tran
general, secure communications were restored between the Tran and Song
courts.

In the1250s, Kubilai, a grandson of Genghis Khan, was campaigning against
Southern Song. He took Chengdu in Sichuan Province in1252.I n 1256, his
general Uriyangqadai moved further south to overrun the Nan Zhao kingdom in
Yunnan. In summer and autumn of1257, Uriyangqadai advanced downriver
through the mountains toward Thang Long. He had sent envoys to the Tran but
waited in vain for them to return. He led a force of around25,000 men, 5,000
Mongols, and 20,000 local levies from Yunnan. His aim was to contribute to
Mongol attacks on Southern Song from the north and west by passing through
Tran territories to attack from the south. It was an unprecedented crisis for the
Tran, who threw the Mongol envoys into a prison and had no intention of
allowing Uriyangqadai to pass.
The Tran manufactured weapons and trained soldiers as the Mongols moved
steadily through the mountainous terrain between the Yunnan plateau and the
Red River plain in two columns, one along the left bank of the Red River and one
along the right bank of the Chay River. Then, in the last month of the year, when
the dry season had started and it was feasible for cavalry to enter the lowlands,
Uriyangqadai emerged from the mountains northwest of Thang Long. His two
columns converged at modern Viet Tri, where the Red and Chay Rivers meet,
and proceeded eastward, north of the Red River.
Tran Canh personally led his men to block the invaders near the modern
district of Binh Xuyen, around thirty-five kilometers northwest of Thang Long.
Meanwhile, Tran Thu Do’s wife, Thuan Trinh, the former queen of Ly Sam and
the mother of Tran Canh’s queen, being the ranking woman in the palace, had
organized the evacuation of Tran women and children, including the crown
prince, from Thang Long. She made sure that the boats also carried as many
weapons as possible for soldiers gathering downriver.
Tran Canh could not hold back Uriyangqadai. His general Le Phu Tran
skillfully delayed the Mongols as Tran Canh hastened to his boats to make his
escape. The Mongol captain tasked with capturing him chased after the royal
boats with his men on horseback along the riverbank, but could not keep up. His
failure earned him a cup of poison. Tran Canh withdrew downriver past Thang
Long, leaving the rearguard in the hands of General Le Phu Tran. Uriyangqadai
occupied Thang Long, where he found his envoys trussed up in a dungeon, one
of them dead. The city was empty of people and provisions. Forays out of the city
to collect food met with stiff resistance and returned with little of value.
The initial defeat and the flight downriver broke the morale of some Tran
commanders. As the crown prince’s boat moved upriver in search of the king’s
boat, the boat of one officer fleeing rapidly downriver sought to avoid him by
passing on the far side of the river. The men with the crown prince shouted to ask
him where were the Mongols. He replied:“I don’t know. Ask the guys who ate

the mangos.” He was referring to an occasion before the campaign when the king
had gathered his men and distributed mangos to them. This man had distin-
guished himself by being so overcome with fright that he could not eat his
mango.
Later, in a small boat with the17-year-old crown prince at his side, the king
encountered the boat of one of his brothers, Tran Nhat Hieu, and asked him
what he advised. Tran Nhat Hieu remained silent but using water wrote with his
finger two characters on his oar meaning to flee to Song. The king then went to
Tran Thu Do’s boat. The65-year-old dynastic rock reportedly said:“My head
has not yet fallen to the ground, so there is nothing for you to worry about.”
Relying upon the counsel and battlefield prowess of Le Phu Tran and others,
Tran Canh rallied his men and returned to the offensive, attacking and pushing
back the Mongol force at Thang Long. From when battle was joined until the
Mongols retreated upriver was only twelve days.
The Mongols were a new kind of enemy. This brief encounter, later numbered
as the first of three Mongol invasions, would be remembered as relatively
insignificant in comparison with the other Mongol wars in the1280s. But it
was a scare, and some Tran nobles fled, not bothering to assemble their soldiers
for battle. Le Phu Tran, a man who in1250 had risen to the rank of general on
the basis of his martial merit, was celebrated as a hero. Tran Canh honored him
with marriage to his former wife, the Ly Princess Chieu Thanh, who had been
separated from him in1237 by Tran Thu Do. Although Chieu Thanh had been
unable to bear children for Tran Canh, she bore a son and a daughter for Le Phu
Tran and died with honor twenty years later. In1274, Le Phu Tran was assigned
to teach military strategy to crown prince Tran Kham, Tran Canh’s grandson,
who would be king during the second and third Mongol invasions.
Living with danger
Alerted to the danger posed by their new Mongol neighbor, the Tran family
moved quickly to further strengthen royal leadership. Within two months of
expelling Uriyangqadai from the lowlands, in early1258, Crown Prince Tran
Hoang was made king and Tran Canh became the senior king. The practice of
having two kings, one senior and one junior, became a stabilizing feature of the
dynasty.
The older generation was passing away. In early1259 came the death of
Thuan Trinh, the heroine of the evacuation of Thang Long. She was the queen
of the last Ly king, the mother of Tran Canh’s queen, the grandmother of many
talented princes and princesses, and for many years the wife of her half-brother,

Tran Thu Do. She had borne the title“Mother of the Kingdom” with the rank
and privileges of a queen dowager.
Tran Thu Do died five years later at the age of71. He remained lucid and
active to the end. Only six months before his death he was leading patrols on
horseback to inspect border terrain in Lang Son Province. He had not received a
literary education, but in political acumen and foresight he had no peer, and for
forty years his had been the final word on all matters of consequence. Tran Canh
instinctively deferred to him, and he exercised the personal authority of a king.
Tran Thu Do was strict but also fair in his own way. According to one
anecdote, a certain person from“the flock of officials” once had the temerity
to approach Tran Canh during a public audience and with tears complain that
Tran Thu Do acted like a king and took advantage of the king’s youth. Tran
Canh immediately adjourned the audience and, taking with him the entire“flock
of officials,” went to Tran Thu Do’s residence and reported to him what the man
had said. Tran Thu Do replied,“Yes, it’s exactly as he says,” and gave the man a
reward for his honesty.
This story tells of utter transparency between Tran Canh and Tran Thu Do
and also of Tran Thu Do’s knowledge of human character, being able to see the
loyalty and concern for royal authority that had motivated the complainer. After
the death in1234 of Tran Canh’s father, Tran Thua, Tran Thu Do was effect-
ively the “senior king” to Tran Canh. The quality of this relationship between
uncle and nephew was a model for the close and trusting relationships that
existed between senior and junior kings in later generations.
In 1262 a royal complex with a palace for the senior king was built near the
home of the Tran family at the site of what is today Pho Minh Temple, about five
kilometers north of the modern city of Nam Dinh, some seventy kilometers
downriver from Thang Long. A second palace was built next to the senior king’s
residence for the junior king to use when coming to visit and consult. Tran kings,
especially senior kings, established a particular relationship with Buddhist
temples on Mount Yen Tu, where Tran Canh had sought refuge during the
family crisis of1237, as a place for study, meditation, and rest.
The regime of registering the population and recording land ownership to
mobilize manpower and to collect taxes that was begun in the1230s and1240s
produced a wandering population of landless, homeless people without any
means of livelihood. These were people who failed to find a place in the new
rural economy. Some may have resisted the registration procedure, preferring to
remain anonymous in the eyes of officialdom, perhaps because of misdeeds in the
past, perhaps because of family associations with the Ly dynasty, perhaps
because of criminal or socially marginal ways of life. Others may not have been
successful in registering their ownership of land, being victims of people quicker

than they were to ingratiate themselves with a new regime. Still others may have
found pleasure and opportunities in the wandering life. In1254, an edict allowed
people to buy communal land and turn it into private property. People who
depended upon communal land would have thereby lost their means of liveli-
hood and many likely joined the vagabond life.
The Tran responded to this by having the royal family take direct responsi-
bility for these people. In1266 Tran nobles were allowed to“recruit” these
people as slaves and put them to work opening up uncultivated land for agricul-
ture that then became their personal estates. This was the beginning of royal
estates farmed by slaves that became a characteristic feature of the Tran rural
regime and which in the fourteenth century would contribute to an era of peasant
rebellions. For several decades, it proved to be a successful way to stabilize the
rural population.
In 1267, in order to limit the number of people who could participate in the
privileges of royalty, an edict cited the rule of venerating one’s ancestors to the
fifth generation to allow people to claim kinship with the royal family only
within five generations of the throne, meaning all who were the great-great-
grandchildren, or closer, of a king. Only a king’s children and grandchildren
were qualified for the ranks of nobility that gave ready access to the palace. The
king could nevertheless assign a title of nobility to anyone he wished, and he
could promote and demote his kin from one rank to another as he considered
appropriate. Being within five generations did not automatically confer nobility
but merely qualified one for receiving appropriate titles from the king. Common-
ers of exceptional quality could be adopted into the royal family or given a status
commensurate with royal kin, but they could not pass this benefit on to their
children. These regulations, combined with the rule of kings being the children of
Tran women, removed any threat of a non-royal family gaining a foothold in the
palace.
A famous example of a prince losing and then regaining royal status is Tran
Khanh Du. His actual relationship with the kings is unknown, but he was
adopted by Tran Hoang as a son and given all the privileges of that rank because
of his battlefield prowess during the Mongol invasion of1257. However, when
he forced intimacy upon a princess who happened to be the wife of Tran Quoc
Tuan’s son, the king sent men to beat him nearly to death, confiscated all his
property, and expelled him from the royal family. He became a coal merchant.
Years later, in1282, when the kingdom was in a flurry of military preparation,
the king, while traveling to a conference of royal princes, noticed Tran Khanh Du
rowing a boat loaded with coal. He restored him to the royal family and gave
him a high military command. Tran Khanh Du won a major naval battle against
the Mongols in1287. Because of his battlefield merit, he was never again

expelled from the royal family, despite his many misdeeds and his reputation for
greed, lust, and arrogance.
Kings kept a close watch over their family members. In1270, one of Tran
Hoang’s cousins was building an elaborate palace with extravagant architectural
features in Nghe An. He sent someone to take a look, which so embarrassed the
man that he installed a Buddha statue and turned the edifice into a temple. On
the other hand, kings were sometimes thwarted by the opinions of their kin. For
example, in1264 Tran Hoang wanted to promote his uncle Tran Nhat Hieu to a
higher position, but Tran Nhat Hieu’s faintheartedness in wanting to run away
to Song during the Mongol invasion had so embarrassed him among the other
nobles that he dared not accept.
From Uriyangqadai’s retreat upriver to Yunnan in the winter of1257–1258
until Mongol armies under the command of Togan began to penetrate the
borders in the winter of1284–1285, envoys shuttled regularly between the Tran
and Mongol leaders. The Tran were prepared to acknowledge Mongol suzer-
ainty to the same degree that they acknowledged Song suzerainty, with triennial
tribute missions. The Mongols demanded more than this, but until the mid1260s
were too occupied with internal struggles and events in China to pay very much
attention to the matter. In1261, Kubilai agreed to the traditional tributary
relationship, but also insisted that a Mongol military overseer, called a
Daruhaci, be stationed in Thang Long.
From 1262 to 1268 the Daruhaci spent little time at Thang Long and there
were reports that the Tran had corrupted him. In1267, Kubilai sent his son
Hugaci to take charge of Yunnan, at the same time sending a list of six demands
to Thang Long: that the Tran king come to the Mongol court, that the king’s
children be kept as hostages at the Mongol court, that census registers be sent,
that taxes be sent, that a Mongol garrison be stationed at Thang Long, and that
all affairs be under the supervision of the Daruhaci. A new Daruhaci was sent in
1268. During the next ten years, there was a stalemate with envoys carrying back
and forth Mongol demands and Tran demurrals.
Until 1271, Kubilai was occupied with internal disputes among the Mongol
princes and with organizing his control over northern China. In that year he
proclaimed the Yuan dynasty and summoned the Tran king to appear at his
court in Dadu (modern Beijing). Tran Hoang excused himself, saying that he was
ill. It was probably no coincidence that at this time Le Van Huu submitted his
book of history to the Tran court. One of Le Van Huu’s arguments in this book
was that the kings of Thang Long were heirs of a southern imperial tradition
established in the second centurybce by Zhao To, King of“Southern Viet,” who
had proclaimed himself emperor during a period of confrontation with the
Han dynasty.

Le Van Huu claimed that, in the tenth century, Dinh Bo Linh had carried
forward Zhao To’s imperial claim, which was then inherited by the Le, the Ly,
and the Tran kings. The poem attributed to Ly Thuong Kiet during the Ly–Song
War of the1070s expresses the idea of northern and southern imperial realms
with a clear border defined by separate heavenly mandates. Whether or not this
poem pre-dated Le Van Huu is a matter for conjecture. If it did, it was but an
ideological elaboration of Ly Nhat Ton’s application of imperial titles and ranks
to his own royal house and court in the mid eleventh century, a rhetoric followed
by all later kings in the realm of ink on paper.
Le Van Huu’s writing of this perspective into history was a response to the
Yuan dynasty’s claim of universal empire at a time when Thang Long’s suzerain
of nearly three centuries, the Song, still existed in southern China. Kubilai may
have been an emperor in the north, but there remained a Song emperor in the
south, not to mention Tran pretensions to imperial status, which were kept
private among the Tran and never acknowledged to the Song or the Yuan. An
interest in borrowing history to argue about the present was not confined to the
Tran, for in1272 a Mongol envoy demanded to know the exact location of
the bronze pillars reportedly erected by Ma Yuan in the first centuryce to
mark the southern limit of the empire. After an investigation, the Tran reported
that no trace of Ma Yuan’s pillars could be found.
Meanwhile, relations with Southern Song went slack as Song became com-
pletely absorbed in its struggle for survival. In1263, a border chieftain who had
been a vassal of Song submitted to the Tran, indicating the shrinkage of Song
authority away from the border. The Song Empire was fading fast. In1274,a
fleet of thirty ships loaded with Song refugees and their families arrived and,
being mostly merchants, were allowed to settle in Thang Long where they
established a new commercial district. This was the beginning of a major emi-
gration of Song refugees.
As Song fortunes sank, the Tran became more determined and watchful as the
Mongol attitude toward them became more imperious. In1275, the Tran court
requested dismissal of the Daruhaci. Kubilai responded by naming a new Dar-
uhaci and renewing the six demands of1267.I n1276, as Kubilai was engaged in
heavy fighting with Song, a Mongol envoy arrived demanding that the Tran
assist by also attacking the Song. The Tran refused. In that year a Tran spy
masquerading as a buyer of medicines was in the north gathering information
about the Mongols.
Amidst this threatening situation, the Tran mechanism of leadership func-
tioned perfectly. Tran Canh died in1277 at the age of59.I n 1278, the 38-
year-old king, Tran Hoang, became senior king and the 20-year-old crown
prince, Tran Kham, became king. Tran Kham’s eldest son, Tran Thuyen,2 years

old, became crown prince. During the Mongol invasions of the1280s there
would be two kings, one in his forties and one in his twenties, as well as a crown
prince in early adolescence. They would stick together in complete harmony
throughout the ordeal.
In 1278, led by a man named Chai Zhuang, Mongol envoys for the first time
came to the border through Guangxi rather than Yunnan. The Tran sought to
redirect them through Yunnan, explaining that the route was not secure, but
Chai Zhuang brushed aside objections and arrived at Thang Long with a letter
from Kubilai full of accusations and demands. Chai Zhuang was turned away
without any satisfaction.
In 1279, the Mongols finally extinguished the Song dynasty and ruled unchal-
lenged in the north. In that year, Chai Zhuang arrived again to reiterate Mongol
demands, and again he was sent away empty-handed. Mongol power was
growing on the northern horizon. An episode in1281 alerted the Tran to this
changing situation. An uncle of the king had been made the leader of a group of
envoys sent to the Yuan court. Kubilai appointed him“King of An Nam” and
sent him back with a mounted escort of one thousand men under the command
of Chai Zhuang, ostensibly to place him on the throne at Thang Long.
This expedition was met at the border by Tran soldiers who let Chai Zhuang
pass but went after the royal renegade and seized him. Chai Zhuang was angry
about what had happened at the border. He arrived in Thang Long at the head of
his armed column and, without dismounting, unceremoniously rode through the
palace gate. When a guard officer attempted to stop him he wounded the man in
the head with his whip and rode on. When he came to the pavilion for foreign
envoys, he dismounted, went in, and sprawled out. Tran Quang Khai, a brother
of the senior king, who had given hospitality to Chai Zhuang on his previous
visits, came with a poem full of polite and diplomatic sentiments to greet him, but
Chai Zhuang refused to acknowledge him.
Tran Quoc Tuan, half-brother of the senior king, then decided to approach
the disgruntled envoy. He shaved his head, donned monk’s robes, and went into
the pavilion where Chai Zhuang and his officers were. He spoke and acted
exactly as a Chinese monk, and Chai Zhuang in astonishment stood up to
receive him. As they drank tea together, Chai Zhuang became aware of Tran
Quoc Tuan’s true identity. He had one of his attendants poke Tran Quoc
Tuan’s head with an arrow, causing blood to flow. Tran Quoc Tuan acted as
if nothing had happened and, according to Thang Long annalists, thereby
tamed Chai Zhuang with politeness. After Chai Zhuang departed Thang Long,
again without anything to show for his long journey, the royal uncle who had
been used by the Mongols to humiliate his kin was demoted and assigned to a

During the twenty-five years following the First Mongol War, the Tran kings
concentrated on enforcing unity and discipline among the princes, strengthening
their grip on the human and material resources of the kingdom, and maintain-
ing a vigilant eye on the north. There was a growing conviction among the
kings and senior princes that the prospect of living in peace with the Mongols
was remote.
The Mongols return
Military preparations preoccupied the Tran kings during1282 and 1283.
Weapons were forged and soldiers were trained. Men recruited to protect the
kings were not allowed to study literature for fear it would diminish their fighting
spirit. In autumn of1282, the two kings called a conference of all their military
leaders at a location near modern Pha Lai, around fifty kilometers east of Thang
Long. Pha Lai was a strategic point that had been fortified for centuries. It was at
the western terminus of the range of mountains along the northern edge of the
Red River plain where four major rivers flowing from the north and west joined
their waters before separating into several channels leading to the sea. Any
invader from the north would have to pass by this point. Nearby were the
personal estates of Tran Quoc Tuan at Van Kiep, which became a major object
of battle in the coming wars. The conference was held in this place not only for
the importance it was expected to have in future battles but also to be away from
Mongol spies stationed in Thang Long.
It was at this conference that Tran Khanh Du, retrieved from the coal business,
was rehabilitated and assigned to command the seaport of Van Don, where, back
to his old tricks, he soon made a small fortune by buying up thousands of
distinctive hats made in a particular village and then ordering all the local people
to buy and wear them in order to distinguish loyal people from strangers and
spies. Tran Quoc Toan, a grandson of Tran Quoc Tuan, was chagrined that he
was considered too young to participate in the conference. He went home to
recruit and train over one thousand soldiers from among his slaves and retainers.
His men became famous as a crack unit that the enemy learned to fear, and he
would himself die in battle. In contrast to this, Tran Kien, a disgruntled nephew
of Tran Quoc Tuan, refused to attend the conference, excusing himself to stay
home and“study Daoism.” Later, when in the press of battle he was ordered to
lead his men into the field, he immediately surrendered and assisted the enemy as
a guide. One Tran prince was excluded from the conference for a different
reason, having been demoted to be a common soldier for writing a letter that
“disparaged the kingdom.”

Following this conference, the Tran nobles and their followers returned to
their home estates to recruit and train their soldiers. The text of a speech
commonly regarded as having been made at this time by Tran Quoc Tuan to
his officers has been preserved in Literary Chinese. The text is full of erudite
allusions to Chinese history that were added by later writers. Nevertheless, the
basic argument is that his officers owe him their obedience because he had given
them everything they have and without him they would be nothing. Further-
more, if they do not fight for him they will lose everything they have to the
enemy, but if they fight with him he will reward them with even more in the
future. In terms of what they have and of what they will additionally receive, he
refers to wives, children, slaves, land, and treasure. Here we see the strong
proprietary mentality of the Tran family, with its sense of possessing the
kingdom and everything in it, being extended as the motivating appeal to its
constellation of entourages.
A different kind of appeal was made to the thousands of Song soldiers who
had fled from the Mongols and found refuge with the Tran. Tran Nhat Duat, a
brother of the senior king, gathered and organized these men into an army that
would win a major battle against the Mongols. Tran solidarity with Song against
the Mongols during the previous thirty years came from a sense of shared
membership in a common civilization under siege by an uncivilized enemy. With
the demise of Song, pride of membership in this civilization and confidence in the
superiority of being civilized was concentrated in the exercise of Tran dynastic
leadership to resist the Mongol foe. Song soldiers were welcomed, placed under
their own officers, and allowed to wear Song uniforms. The Tran were careful to
alert their soldiers who campaigned with this army not to mistake them for the
enemy.
Soldiers were tattooed with characters reading“death to Mongols,” and signs
were distributed reading:“When the invaders come, everyone must fight them. If
you are not strong enough to resist them, you are permitted to flee, but you must
not surrender to them.” In autumn 1284, as Tran spies reported that Mongol
armies were marching toward the borders, soldiers were sent to their assigned
stations in the mountain passes. Tran Quoc Tuan commanded the armies facing
the modern Chinese province of Guangxi, and Tran Nhat Duat led Song and
Tran troops to watch the border with Yunnan.
When all was in readiness in late 1284, the senior king, Tran Hoang,
summoned the“elders” in the kingdom to Thang Long. He discussed with them
the situation and asked for their response. They reportedly shouted in unison:
“To war!” Held just days before the first battles, the purpose of this meeting was
to alert these village leaders to what would be expected of the people under their
supervision and to rally them to follow wartime instructions.

One of the Mongol demands was that the Tran give provisions and passage to
their armies en route to Champa. Kubilai was attacking in all directions at that
time, through Korea into Japan, into northern Burma, and also into Champa,
which he viewed as a stepping-stone for further seaborne conquests in Southeast
Asia and India. The Cham coast was the safest route to avoid the dangerous reefs
in the South China Sea. Emboldened by the stiff Tran attitude toward the
Mongols, the Cham king, Indravarman V, refused to cooperate with Mongol
ambitions, even daring to detain Mongol envoys on their way to Siam and India.
In the winter of1282–1283, a large army led by the Mongol general Sogetu
arrived by sea at the Cham capital of Vijaya near the modern city of Qui Nhon.
Sogetu defeated the Chams and entered Vijaya, but Indravarman V refused to
submit and instead held fast in the nearby mountains, mobilizing more soldiers
from distant places. Sogetu abandoned Vijaya and fortified a camp on the coast
where he spent a year waiting vainly for reinforcements.
In spring 1284, Sogetu embarked his army and sailed up the coast to the
northernmost Cham districts in the modern provinces of Thua Thien, Quang Tri,
and Quang Binh, where he won some battles, gathered provisions, and waited
for reinforcements. Instead of reinforcements, however, in late1284 he received
orders to march north to Thang Long in support of other Mongol armies
marching against the Tran from Guangxi and Yunnan.
The Mongol army, under the command of Kubilai’s son Togan, included a
core of Mongol units, many trusted units recruited in northern China, and some
less reliable units recruited from the old Song territory in southern China. It
emerged from Guangxi, crossed the border into Lang Son Province, and fought
its way through the passes to a rendezvous at Pha Lai/Van Kiep with the Mongol
fleet coming upriver under the command of a Mongol general named Omar.
With an army mobilized from nearby localities and over one thousand war boats,
Tran Quoc Tuan attempted to prevent this rendezvous. Togan and Omar
brushed aside the Tran forces and advanced to Thang Long along the Duong
River. Tran forces could not hold them back, and, less than one month after
crossing the border, Togan entered Thang Long. The Mongol army in Yunnan
commanded by Nasirrudin had meanwhile advanced downriver, pushing away
all resistance to their progress, and also arrived at Thang Long.
Withdrawing Tran armies concentrated in the region of the modern city of
Nam Dinh, near the Tran home estates. Togan and Omar advanced down the
Red River against them, defeating a series of counterattacks meant to delay them.
One of these counterattacks became famous because of the person who was
captured while leading it. Tran Binh Trong was a descendent of Le Hoan who,
because of his valor, had been adopted into the royal family and given a widowed
sister of the senior king as wife. When his Mongol captors offered him riches and

honor if he would turn to serve them, he is reported to have replied:“It is better
to be a ghost in the southern kingdom than a prince in the north.” He was
beheaded.
Sogetu had penetrated the southern border and was advancing northward
through Nghe An Province where Tran Quoc Khang, a full brother of Tran Quoc
Tuan, was in command. All available Tran armies were sent south to stop Sogetu
and prevent him from linking up with Togan. Tran Nhat Duat, Tran Quang Khai,
and Tran Ich Tac, brothers of the senior king, were ordered to lead their armies
south, and even Tran Kien was stirred from his Daoist reverie and sent to lead his
men to join his father, Tran Quoc Khang. However, unable to overcome the store
of resentment he had been nursing for years, Tran Kien immediately went over to
the Mongols and guided them against other Tran units hastening south. Tran Ich
Tac, with a different store of resentment, also joined the enemy, bringing several
other generals with him. Sogetu advanced through Thanh Hoa.
The Tran leaders attempted to slow down Togan by sending envoys to negotiate
peace, even sending him the senior king’s full sister as an ostensible token of
sincerity. At the same time, Tran Quoc Tuan and his son-in-law Pham Ngu Lao
led a force in several hundred war boats through the rivers back to Van Kiep, the
headquarters for Togan’s supply line from the border to Thang Long. Unable to
retake Van Kiep, they nevertheless organized Tran forces along the Mongol supply
routes to keep them under constant attack. This gained the attention of Togan and
prompted him to worry about his rear. He paused and requested reinforcements
from Kubilai, but when the Tran kings refused his demand that they appear before
him in person, he continued his advance to link up with Sogetu, who pressed
forward from Thanh Hoa into the Red River plain.
The two kings were faced with the prospect of being crushed between the two
Mongol armies. Tran Quang Khai from the south and Tran Quoc Tuan from the
north had rejoined them and together they made plans to lure Togan’s attention
back north while preparing to reconcentrate in Sogetu’s rear, in Thanh Hoa. As
Togan’s and Sogetu’s armies linked up, the kings and generals fled by boat out to
sea and up the coast to the Ba Che River in Quang Ninh Province, near the
Chinese border. Omar’s war boats chased after them down the Red River but
they disappeared into the sea and Omar returned with no idea of where they had
gone. Disembarking at Ba Che, the Tran leaders sent the royal boats further up
the coast to the border to attract the attention of the enemy and then walked on
foot over the mountains to the Bach Dang River. With news that the Tran leaders
were in the north, Togan went back to Thang Long, concerned that some new
threat would materialize in his rear. Meanwhile, the Tran leaders embarked from
the Bach Dang River and went directly by sea to Thanh Hoa, where they rallied
their scattered armies.

After the Tran leaders had disappeared into the sea, many followed the
example of Tran Ich Tac, Tran Kien, and others. Large numbers of Tran officials
and soldiers surrendered, convinced that the war was finished. Togan was in
Thang Long while Sogetu was at Ninh Binh with some units posted along the
Red River between the two points. Hearing that Tran forces were reforming in
Thanh Hoa, Togan ordered Sogetu to take some of his men back south to
confront them and sent Omar with sixty war boats to assist with water transport.
The summer rains were beginning. Suddenly, Tran armies arrived from Thanh
Hoa by boat, moving rapidly up the Red River.
Tran Quoc Tuan defeated Mongol forces stationed at modern Hung Yen, and
the Tran armies proceeded upriver. Around twenty-five kilometers south of
Thang Long, Togan attempted to stop them. In a series of running battles the
Mongols were pushed back. Tran Quoc Tuan’s grandson Tran Quoc Toan led
the attack at Tay Ket, Tran Nhat Duat’s Song soldiers led the attack at Ham Tu,
and Tran Quang Khai led the attack at Chuong Duong, on the edge of Thang
Long. As Tran forces broke into Thang Long, Togan withdrew to Gia Lam on
the north side of the Red River.
Sogetu and Omar looked in vain for the Tran armies in Thanh Hoa, for the
two Tran kings had led their remaining forces north to attack the Mongols left
behind by Sogetu at Ninh Binh. These Mongols fled and just had time to join
Togan at Gia Lam before he began his retreat toward Van Kiep. The Tran armies
that had taken Thang Long followed in close pursuit, inflicting many casualties
with attacks and ambushes. Togan fought his way through the mountains to the
Lang Son border and safety. At the same time, Nasirrudin had a similar experi-
ence of many ambushes as he withdrew back to Yunnan.
Sogetu and Omar, lacking good information, returned from their Thanh Hoa
sojourn and, hoping to rejoin Togan, came up the Red River toward Thang Long.
The two Tran kings defeated them in battle at Tay Ket. Sogetu was capturedand
killed as Omar fled downriver and out to sea. The Tran kings returned to Thang
Long six months after the Mongols first crossed the borders.
After proclaiming punishments for those who had gone over to the enemy
during the fighting, one of the first post-war tasks taken up by the kings was to
order that a census be taken, which occasioned the first recorded argument
between a Tran king and his scholar-officials. The officials reasoned that the
turmoil and distress occasioned by the war made a census unpropitious. The king
replied that it made a census all the more necessary in order to assess damages
and losses and to know the condition of the kingdom.
In early 1286, enemy prisoners were released to return north, but a few
months later came news that Kubilai had issued orders for a new invasion, and
the Tran kings again looked to their soldiers. Stung by Togan’s defeat, Kubilai

took a vengeful view of the Tran. He cancelled plans underway for a third
invasion of Japan and concentrated military preparations in the south. But
uprisings in southern China and the time needed to recruit and train new armies
forced him to postpone his attack for one year.
In the winter dry season of1287–1288, Togan again crossed the border into
Lang Son Province and moved through the mountains into the lowlands for a
rendezvous with the Mongol fleet at Van Kiep. Tran Khanh Du, at Van Don,
could not prevent the Mongol war fleet, commanded by Omar, from passing
down the coast and upriver to Van Kiep. However, several days later the Mongol
supply fleet came along, and he completely ruined it, capturing or sinking every
ship, save a small boat in which the Mongol commander fled to Hainan Island.
The loss of their supply fleet doomed this Mongol campaign.
At Van Kiep, Togan and Omar waited in vain for the supply fleet before
proceeding to Thang Long where they were joined by the column from Yunnan.
Together they pushed Tran forces down the Red River and out to sea. Running
out of provisions, Togan returned to Thang Long and sent out foraging parties.
Omar paused at the Tran home estates to despoil Tran Canh’s tomb, then went
in search of the supply fleet, of which he found no trace.
After a month of sitting at Thang Long, Togan withdrew to Van Kiep, where
Omar joined him after fighting and foraging his way back up the Bach Dang River.
Tran armies gathered and hemmed in Togan and Omar at Van Kiep. After a
month had passed, the Mongols were running out of food and had no choice but to
break out and return to China. Omar went downriver where he was captured and
his entire fleet was lost when Tran Quoc Tuan ambushed him at the Bach Dang
estuary. Meanwhile, Togan fought his way through the mountains to the Lang
Son border, and the Yunnan contingent returned the way it had come.
Kubilai was not reconciled to this defeat. He continued to issue plans for
another invasion until his death in1294. But Mongol expeditions were engaged
in Burma and in Java during these years, and Kubilai’s followers were growing
weary of conquest. In1289, the Tran released most of their prisoners of war, but
Omar, whose return Kubilai particularly demanded, was intentionally drowned
when the boat transporting him was contrived to sink.
It is recorded that during the Mongol invasions“many noblemen and officials
went to the invader’s camps and surrendered.” After the wars, those who
returned to allegiance were examined and suffered punishments appropriate to
their cases, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or changing of
surname as a mark of treason. After this procedure was completed, a trunk
captured from the Mongols that was filled with lists of the names of those who
had surrendered to them was burned to symbolically put an end to the matter
and“to soothe rebellious inclinations.”

After punishing traitors, the Tran kings presided over another round of
rewarding the meritorious. When some expressed dissatisfaction with what they
had received, the senior king is reported to have won them over by saying:“If
any of you can guarantee that the enemy will not return, I will promote you to
the highest rank possible and not be sorry to do it. But supposing it turns out that
you are wrong, and I have already given you a generous reward; if you earn more
merit when the enemy returns, what more can I give to reward you then?” The
appeal was to material rewards. And the prospect of another Mongol attack
remained alive.
In the winter of1289–1290, the king, Tran Kham, led an attack into what is
now Laos. He brushed aside the objections of scholar-officials who argued that
the land was still suffering from the effects of war by saying that it was necessary
to do this precisely for that reason, so the people in the mountains who were
inclined to raid the lowlands would not get the idea that war had exhausted Tran
defenses. Another reason may have been to offer opportunities for his men to
earn more merit and plunder.
Farewell to tattoos
In late1288, tax exemptions were published proportional to wartime damages.
But there were also long-term economic and social effects of the war. By autumn of
1290, a famine began that lasted for two years, causing taxes to be cancelled
entirely. The Tran court distributed food to the poor for a time until overwhelmed
by the starving. There is no record of what caused these crop failures. Perhaps a
decade of preoccupation with war had led to neglect and breakdown of the water
control system. Perhaps the mobilization of men out of the rice fields into the
battlefields had disrupted the planting and harvesting calendar. Perhaps there
were floods, drought, and pestilence that have not been recorded.
Whatever the case, the result was a socio-economic shift with a drastic reduc-
tion in population from death by starvation, the abandonment of villages, and
large numbers of people selling their land, and also selling their children and
themselves into slavery, in order to survive. In1292, as the famine eased, a law
was published that people who had sold themselves into slavery during the
famine could be redeemed, but land and property could not be redeemed. The
people in a position to acquire the land, property, and slaves made available at
bargain prices during this long famine were the Tran noblemen and their entou-
rages with their riches and honors earned in wartime. The trend toward large
aristocratic estates worked by slave labor or the labor of peasants in a serf-like
condition accelerated from this time.

It was amidst this dire famine that the royal family passed through another
generational transition. Tran Hoang, the senior king, died in1290 at the age of
50. He had been the center around which the clashing egos of Tran princes had
revolved during the dramatic events of the1280s. He was a master of discipline,
of consensus, and of delegating authority. His father, Tran Canh, had taught him
the importance of family solidarity. His son, Tran Kham, and his grandson, Tran
Thuyen, learned to exercise similar attitudes toward maintaining dynastic
leadership.
In 1292, the 16-year-old crown prince, Tran Thuyen, was married to a
granddaughter of Tran Quoc Tuan, and the following year he was proclaimed
king. Tran Kham, still in his mid30s, became senior king. He remained very
much in command until his death in1308. He encouraged his younger brothers,
Tran Duc Viep and Tran Quoc Chan, to play more active roles at court. Tran
Duc Viep died in1306, but Tran Quoc Chan was a prominent member of the
court for the next thirty years. He became a trusted advisor of Tran Thuyen, and
the circumstances of his death in1328 came to symbolize for later historians a
major turn in dynastic fortunes.
Shortly after Tran Thuyen’s accession, his mother, a daughter of Tran Quoc
Tuan, died. She was much respected for her bravery. Stories were told of how she
once protected her husband, Tran Kham, from a tiger that had escaped from its
cage, and how she had confronted a runaway elephant that had broken into her
palace. She was typical of many Tran women who were praised for their courage
and loyalty during the era of the Mongol Wars.
In the late1290s, tension erupted between the senior and junior kings. In his
early twenties, Tran Thuyen developed a habit of going out into the city at night
with a group of companions and carousing until dawn. His fondness for alcohol
led to many days when the palace dozed away the daylight hours while he slept
off his hangover. Tran Kham spent most of his time at the downriver palace.
However, when he discovered what was going on in Thang Long, he became
exceedingly angry and severely rebuked the young king, threatening to dethrone
him and replace him with a brother. Tran Thuyen eventually took his father’s
reprimands to heart and for the rest of his life forswore drinking alcohol. He
came to be regarded as a strong and competent king, strict but fair, loyal to
friends but also a good judge of character. Yet, his youthful rebellion left a lasting
mark on the dynasty with a loosening of pride in the Tran martial ethos.
In 1299, Tran Kham summoned Tran Thuyen to a palace where, before an
audience of Tran princes, arrangements had been made for him to be tattooed in
the manner of Tran men. Tran Kham’s explanation to his son was recorded as
follows: “Our family comes from the river mouth and our ancestors were blessed
with good fortune. For generations we have respected martial valor and our

profession has been war. We all have dragons tattooed on our thighs to show
that we have not forgotten our origin.” The Tran sense of family solidarity was
based on a warrior ethos that was expressed by the tattoos on their thighs.
According to an explanation recorded at that time, the dragons on Tran thighs
were associated with the crocodiles found at the mouth of the Red River. The
dragon was also an old and enduring symbol of royal authority shared with
other Asian thrones. Perhaps the Tran journey upriver to Thang Long was
celebrated with a visual reminder of how a crocodile became a dragon.
Tran Thuyen, however, did not want to be tattooed. He watched and waited
for a moment when his father’s attention was taken in conversation with others,
and then he quickly slipped away from the palace. He was the first Tran king not
to be tattooed. A generation later, in1323, men selected as officers for the palace
guard could no longer wear tattoos, which by then were considered old fash-
ioned and ugly. The abandonment of this mark of family identity came amidst a
gradual but fundamental shift in the composition of dynastic leadership.
Farewell to the princes
For a few decades, the heroes of the Mongol Wars continued to lead soldiers,
govern assigned territories, and offer advice at court. But they passed steadily
from the scene. Tran Quang Khai, Tran Quoc Tuan’s closest friend and the hero
of the Battle of Chuong Duong, died in1294. Tran Quoc Tuan, commander-in-
chief and the hero of the Battles of Tay Ket and Bach Dang, died in1300, as also
did his full brother Tran Quoc Khang, who had spent his career in Nghe An and
had fought running battles with Sogetu’s army as it came north from Champa.
Tran Quoc Tuan’s son-in-law Pham Ngu Lao, who gained fame for laying
ambushes for Togan in the northern mountains, actively led soldiers on the
frontiers until just before his death in1320. The longest surviving members of
that generation were Tran Nhat Duat, Tran Khanh Du, and Tran Khac Chung,
and they each represented particular tendencies in the royal family.
Tran Nhat Duat was born in1255. A son of Tran Canh and the hero of the
Battle of Ham Tu, he was active as a loyal member of the royal entourage
throughout his life. Whether suppressing rebellion in the mountains or leading
armies against Mongols, he was always reliable. He spent much time with non-
Viet people and never needed an interpreter, whether talking with Chams, with
upland peoples, or with Chinese. His personal estates were in Thanh Hoa and all
of his wives were from that province, but he remained attentive to affairs in
Thang Long for many years and was deeply concerned about the future leader-
ship of the dynasty.

Tran Thuyen’s senior wife, a granddaughter of Tran Quoc Tuan known as the
Bao Tu queen, had no children, and sons born to lesser wives had not survived
infancy. Then, in1300, Tran Thuyen finally obtained a son and heir when Tran
Manh was born to the Chieu Tu queen, a daughter of Princess Thuy Bao and
Tran Binh Trong, who had been captured and killed during the Mongol Wars.
Although not from the senior line of the Tran family, the Chieu Tu queen was
nevertheless a high-ranking Tran woman, so there were particularly strong hopes
that her son would survive to inherit the throne. Fearing that the palace was not
propitious for the health of infants, Chieu Tu’s mother, the Princess Thuy Bao,
was asked to take responsibility for rearing the baby. She excused herself from
the task and asked her brother, Tran Nhat Duat, to do this in her place.
Tran Nhat Duat reared Tran Manh as if he were one of his own sons, training
him in martial skills, seeing to his education with books, and teaching him to
have concern for public affairs while at the same time living simply and viewing
himself as but one member of a dynastic team. Tran Manh would be king during
a time of unprecedented challenges to dynastic authority. That he would be able
to maintain a measure of integrity and competence amidst a general shift in social
and political values away from Tran leadership is a tribute to the quality of Tran
Nhat Duat as an adoptive father and mentor. When Tran Thuyen spent six
months away on an expedition to Champa in1312, Tran Nhat Duat was left in
charge at Thang Long with the young crown prince. By the time Tran Manh had
come of age and became sole king in1320, Tran Nhat Duat was advancing in
age and became less active at court. He died at age75 in 1330.
Tran Khanh Du, with his checkered yet illustrious career, represents the
tendency of some Tran princes to withdraw from public affairs and pursue
private gain, ignoring Thang Long and settling down to a life of leisure on their
estates. He had a reputation for corruption and making trouble, but his seizure of
the Mongol supply fleet in1288 made him a hero and virtually untouchable for
the rest of his long life.
Tran Kham disliked him and considered him to be a bad influence in the royal
family. In 1296, Tran Kham summoned him to answer charges that his coarse
and greedy behaviour was causing distress to the people in his jurisdiction. He
replied,“We are hawks and the people are ducks. The purpose of ducks is to feed
the hawks. What’s so strange about that?” Tran Kham was so incensed with this
arrogant reply that Tran Khanh Du hastened from Thang Long before judicial
proceedings could be initiated against him. He kept away from court affairs until
after Tran Kham’s death. When Tran Thuyen attacked Champa in1312, he was
placed in charge of the seaborne units, but his lust for plunder and disregard of
instructions angered Tran Thuyen. His last recorded public act was in1316
when he was sent to conduct a census and to collect taxes in Nghe An. The king

made sure to send along with him an official known for integrity, but that did not
prevent accusations of fraud from being made. Thereafter, Tran Khanh Du is not
mentioned in the records until his death in1339, at which time he must have
been around100 years old.
The trend among Tran princes in the fourteenth century was for there to be
fewer and fewer in the mold of Tran Nhat Duat and increasing numbers who
withdrew from public life to their own private lives in the mode of Tran Khanh
Du. Tran Khac Chung represented a different and more portentous trend of
people entering the royal family from outside and compromising it for their own
ambitions. This man was originally named Do Khac Chung, but he was given the
royal surname and adopted into the royal family as a result of his high-risk but
successful performance in a side drama of the Mongol invasion of1284–1285.
When Togan and Omar were camped across the river from Thang Long shortly
before occupying it, the senior king, Tran Hoang, called for a volunteer to go
into the Mongol camp and pretend to negotiate for peace while in fact spying out
the situation there. Do Khac Chung, a famous gambler, was excellent at present-
ing a bold front and engaging in clever talk; he immediately asked to be given the
assignment. In the course of his successful visit to the Mongol camp he had an
interview with Omar in which, as recorded among the Tran, he audaciously
bantered with the Mongol general. He then got safely away despite efforts by
Omar to have him detained. He was subsequently admitted to high councils and
given the royal surname with the rank of a Tran nobleman.
In 1298, Tran Khac Chung was appointed to administer the royal capital of
Thang Long. In1303, he was elevated to a coveted rank with close access to the
king, normally reserved for eunuchs. During a visit to Champa in1301, Tran
Kham had promised a marriage alliance with the Cham king. In1305, when
Cham envoys arrived with gifts, asking for fulfillment of this promise, all of the
court officials argued against it except for Tran Khac Chung and one other
prince. Tran Kham sent a princess to marry the Cham king. Two years later,
the Cham king died and the Tran worried that the princess was in danger of
being burned on his funeral pyre. Tran Khac Chung was sent to rescue her from
that prospect. He arrived back in Thang Long many months later after dawdling
at sea to prolong an affair with the princess. This earned him the hatred of some
Tran princes, in particular a son of Tran Quoc Tuan who, referring to the
meaning of the characters in Tran Khac Chung’s name, said: “This guy is
unlucky for our house. Does not his name mean that we are finished?” (Tran
Khac Chung literally means:“the Tran can die.”)
Thereafter, Tran Khac Chung kept a low profile for a few years, but after Tran
Kham’s death he insinuated himself back into the center of things, obtaining
promotions in1313 and 1315. He was so prominent at court in1315 that some

officials blamed him for a drought in that year, saying that it was a sign of his
wickedness. He once suffered a demotion for publicly making a joke and causing
laughter in the palace when the Tran royal tombs were struck by lightning, but it
was a temporary setback. With a glib tongue he talked himself into the confi-
dence of the young and unsuspecting king.
In 1319, Tran Manh’s first son, Tran Vuong, was born to a non-royal woman
from Tran Khac Chung’s home village in the eastern part of the Red River plain.
She had apparently been introduced into the palace through Tran Khac Chung’s
influence. Tran Khac Chung posed as a“teacher” of Tran Vuong and began to
nurture hopes of the boy inheriting the throne.
Despite Tran Khac Chung’s aspirations for Tran Vuong, there remained a
strong belief among senior members of the dynasty that the mothers of kings
must be from the royal family. The leader of this group was Tran Quoc Chan, a
brother of Tran Kham. In the1310s he twice led armies against Champa and
became the most trusted advisor of the senior king, Tran Thuyen. Before he died
in1320, Tran Thuyen established Tran Quoc Chan as the mentor of his heir, the
young king Tran Manh. In1323, Tran Quoc Chan’s daughter, Hien Tu, was
appointed Tran Manh’s senior queen. Her age is not known but she was still too
young to bear children. Tran Khac Chung and others argued for making Tran
Vuong the crown prince. Tran Quoc Chan argued forcefully against this, asking
to wait until his daughter, a Tran woman, could produce an heir.
Frustrated by Tran Quoc Chan’s influence, those who wished to see Tran
Vuong made king conceived a plot. Tran Phau, a member of Tran Quoc Chan’s
entourage, was bribed with a large amount of gold to falsely accuse Tran Quoc
Chan of treason. In1328, Tran Quoc Chan was imprisoned in a temple. The
young king was uncertain what to do. Tran Khac Chung advised that“it is easier
to capture a tiger than to let one go,” and Tran Quoc Chan was left to die of
starvation. In the following year, Tran Vuong was made king, with Tran Manh
becoming senior king.
Tran Khac Chung did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his schemes. He died
in 1330. One of Tran Quoc Chan’s sons sent a slave to dig up his corpse and to
chop it into bits. It was not until1344 that Tran Quoc Chan was posthumously
rehabilitated when a dispute among the wives in Tran Phau’s household brought
the conspiracy into the open. Tran Phau was condemned to die by slicing, and
Tran Quoc Chan’s son ate his flesh as it was cut away. Tran Vuong, the young
prince who became king as a result of the conspiracy, died in1341 at age 22.
Meanwhile, Queen Hien Tu had begun to have children, and one of these,
5-year-old Tran Hao, was immediately raised to the throne.
In his later years, Tran Manh was haunted by his“error” in not preventing the
death of Tran Quoc Chan. The death of Tran Quoc Chan ended the mutual trust

and family discipline that had been the strength of previous generations of Tran
leaders. Tran Manh was thereafter a lonely king. The counsel of senior princes
and the loyal service of junior princes became more attenuated than it had ever
been for a Tran king.
Already in1300, the right to contribute to discussions at court was restricted to
those who had participated in the wars. Anyone speaking up who did not have a
veteran’s identification card was demoted. However, some cards were issued
during a time in1258 when the royal seal had been lost and temporarily replaced
with a hastily carved wooden seal, and there were questions about these having
been counterfeited. So an inquest was initiated to examine such cards for authen-
tication. The same issue came up again in1316, and Tran Thuyen, who experi-
enced the wars of the1280s as an adolescent, commented:“People at court who
are not familiar with references to the past will make big mistakes in their work.”
Even as the older generation resisted the loosening of its grip on public affairs,
new fashions took hold, stimulated by the cosmopolitan energy of the Mongol
Yuan dynasty. Sorcery and fasting to obtain supernatural knowledge and power
had been practiced for centuries, but a Daoist master from Fujian stimulated an
unprecedented popularization of these practices in the early fourteenth century.
A royal servant famous for training horses, playing chess, and mixing medicine
studied with Daoist experts to perform exorcisms. A Buddhist yoga master from
China claiming to be100 years old amazed people with his curious skills and
even obtained the admission of his daughter into the palace. Performers from
China introduced tightrope walking and rope dancing as well as Yuan dynasty
classical opera (calledtuong in its Vietnamese adaptation).
The strangest case of all was connected with Tran Hao, who in1341 became
king at the age of5. When he was3 years old, he had fallen into a lake while
watching fish and was apparently drowned. A doctor named Trau Canh revived
the boy with acupuncture. Trau Canh’s father had been a doctor with the
Mongols during the1280s, was captured by the Tran, and then chose to remain
in Thang Long. He treated members of the royal family and became rich with
land and slaves. Trau Canh followed his father’s profession and was known as a
skillful physician. In 1351, he prescribed a cure for the 15-year-old king’s
impotence that involved human sacrifice and sexual intercourse with his sister.
The cure was declared successful, although Tran Hao never did have any
children, and Trau Canh thereafter became a popular physician among the
palace women. With free access to the palace he began to carry on affairs with
the women there. Informed of this, Tran Manh, the senior king, wanted to have
him killed, but he was spared because he had saved Tran Hao’s life.
Tran Manh hated Trau Canh so much that when Trau Canh came to his
deathbed in1357 and repeatedly informed him that his pulse was“melancholy,”

Tran Manh roused himself to write a satirical poem before he died:“When
examining the pulse do not speak of too much melancholy; Mr. Trau’s medicine
should blend the ingredients; If one unceasingly speaks of melancholy, I fear that
melancholy will only be aroused to increase.” The reluctant mercy shown to the
doctor was emblematic of Tran Manh’s intelligent yet inclusive spirit, the last
echo of his great-great-grandfather Tran Canh’s teachings about non-duality.
Although in1347 he ordered a kinsman to be killed for stealing one of his robes
and then having the cheek to wear it at court, Tran Manh sometimes substituted
poetry for justice. Within a decade of his death, Tran Hao’s palace became a
playground for clever commoners. It was also at this time that an unprecedented
challenge began to materialize on the Cham frontier.
Tran Kham’s visit to the Cham king in1301 had built upon the anti-Mongol
alliance to achieve a marriage agreement. In return for a Tran woman as wife, the
Cham king relinquished his claim to modern Quang Tri and Thua Thien Prov-
inces. The death of the Cham king in1307 dissolved the marriage and gave rise
to Cham demands for the return of those territories. Tran Thuyen’s expedition of
1311–1312 was in part a response to those demands and resulted in deposing the
Cham king and replacing him with a brother who agreed to be a Tran vassal. In
1313, a Tran army was sent to repulse a Siamese army from Sukhothai, a
kingdom in central Thailand, which had emerged from the mountains to attack
the Chams. In1318, a Tran expedition expelled the Cham vassal, who had
rebelled, and replaced him with another Cham leader. In1326, that vassal also
rebelled, defeated a Tran expedition, and thereafter sought to regain the lost
territories. The Tran took no initiatives toward Champa for over two decades,
being occupied for several years in the1330s with fighting against encroaching
Laotians along the upper Ca River in Nghe An. In1353, an attempt to intervene
in a Cham succession dispute failed when Cham war boats prevented supply
ships from reaching the Tran army, which had advanced as far as modern Quang
Ngai Province before turning back. Thereafter, the Tran were on the defensive in
the south. In the1360s, a Cham king appeared, called Che Bong Nga, who in the
1370s and1380s would strike deadly blows upon the Tran dynasty.
Tran Manh and the late Tran literati
In the1320s, as the older generation of Tran nobles died and the younger
generation showed little interest in government, Tran Manh came to rely increas-
ingly upon a new generation of educated commoners, scholars of the Confucian
classics who entered government by taking written examinations. There had
been no exams since before the Mongol Wars when, in1299, a call was issued

for students to prepare for an examination. The exam was held in1304 and
graduated 44 men with330 others selected to pursue further study. The curricu-
lum for exams was clearly announced and included taking dictation, writing
essays on the Confucian classics, writing poetry, and demonstrating knowledge
of mourning regulations and of how to write royal proclamations and petitions
to the king. Until the1370s, when the political situation changed drastically,
the court annals record further examinations in1314 and 1344; another source
indicates an examination in1364, and there may have been others for which
information has not survived. Other kinds of exams were also held during this
time, for example in1304 officials in the judiciary were examined on their
knowledge of the law, and in1321 monks were examined on their knowledge
of the Diamond Sutra.
Apparently stimulated by the exam of1304, a new type of poetry became
fashionable. The exam included a type of prose poem that had been developed in
the Han dynasty, calledphu (Chinese fu). Subsequently,phu began to be written
in the vernacular using Nom characters. Nguyen Si Co, a scholar and official
with a reputation for being good at making jokes, is associated with this new
poetic form. Younger scholars fondly remembered his collegial, friendly, and
entertaining manner.
Quite different in personality were Truong Han Sieu and Nguyen Trung Ngan,
both of whom had long and illustrious careers at court in the mid fourteenth
century. After the death of Tran Thuyen in1320, and with the thinning out of
Tran princes interested in public affairs, Tran Manh brought many talented
scholars into service at court. The court annal notes in1323 that scholars had
become more numerous at court and from that time were taking a larger role in
court discussions. The names of thirteen scholars were listed in that year as the
most prominent, and two of these were Truong Han Sieu and Nguyen Trung
Ngan.
Truong Han Sieu (?–1354) had come to notice in the entourage of Tran Quoc
Tuan, who introduced him to service at court before his death in1300. Because
of his erudition, the kings called him“teacher” rather than referring to him by his
name. In the1320s he had risen to the highest position at court for someone not
a member of the royal family, a position that gave him personal access to the
king. He had a reputation for being distant and arrogant toward other scholars.
He socialized with eunuchs and married his daughters to men of wealth rather
than of learning. In1326 he accused two scholars working in the judiciary of
taking bribes. When Tran Manh ordered an investigation, Truong Han Sieu
remarked to someone that an investigation should not be necessary because he
was himself someone of high position and his word should be good enough.
When Tran Manh heard of this remark, he rebuked Truong Han Sieu, saying

that no matter what their rank or position all officials served him and he would
not take the word of one against another. The investigation revealed that Truong
Han Sieu had no grounds for his accusation and so he was fined heavily. One of
the men whom he had accused was found to be“honest and meticulous” and
was accordingly promoted.
From the late1330s into the1350s, Truong Han Sieu again received important
assignments at court. In 1339 he wrote an inscription on the occasion of
renovating a Buddhist temple, and in1343 he wrote another inscription on the
occasion of renovating a stupa. In these inscriptions he expressed a complicated
attitude that combined his Confucian education with both appreciation for
Buddhism as a moral force and criticism of superstitious and corrupt practices
that he believed were undermining this moral force. Later Confucian historians
took his critical comments out of context to argue that he opposed Buddhism.
Buddhists, in turn, have pointed to a poem of his that refers to his having made
an“error” to suggest that he was expressing repentance for having opposed
Buddhism; in fact, the poem says that the“error” was in being defensive about
his reputation and plausibly refers to the1326 episode. Truong Han Sieu died in
1354 on his way back from supervising soldiers sent to reinforce the southern
border against Cham attacks after the unsuccessful expedition of the previous
year.
Nguyen Trung Ngan (1289–1370) was a child prodigy who passed the exam-
ination of1304 and irritated colleagues with his boundless pride. He was famous
for writing a poem that read as follows:“I am a talented scholar at court; from
childhood my spirit could swallow a water buffalo; at twelve I was an advanced
student; at sixteen I passed the examinations; at twenty I was a government
official; at twenty-six I was sent as envoy to Beijing.” In addition to excessive
pride, he was also known to be careless with details, which led to a setback in
1326when he incorrectly recorded the rank of a Tran nobleman. Tran Manh
appreciated his ability so did not punish him for this but rather reassigned him
away from court in Thanh Hoa. Six years later he was back at court and received
a series of promotions until in1342 he was placed in charge of the Privy Council.
In that year, the Privy Council was given responsibility for selecting the palace
guardsmen, and he personally supervised the guard units in Thang Long. In
consideration of this, from1351 he was allowed to wear a military uniform.
Another man found on the1323 list of scholars was Doan Nhu Hai, who had
begun to serve at court in the1290s. He gained favor when he assisted the
reconciliation between Tran Kham and Tran Thuyen during their feud over Tran
Thuyen’s drunkenness. He later distinguished himself as an envoy to Champa
and with administration on the Cham frontier. In1335, he led an army up the Ca
River in Nghe An against encroaching Lao. After initial success he led his army

into a trap. More than half of his men were lost, and he was drowned trying to
escape. Tran Manh eulogized him by warning his officials to beware of excessive
ambition and of trying to achieve too much. In fact, this class of scholars was
socialized to compete for the attention of the king, and the desire for acclaim was
for them conflated with public service. They were not members of a bureaucracy
in which promotions and demotions followed a prescribed procedure. As Tran
Manh made clear in1326, they were members of the royal entourage and stood
equally in relation to him for assignment as he saw fit; he did not recognize any
appeal to hierarchy among them.
An episode demonstrating Tran Manh ’s attitude toward court officials
occurred in 1342 when he appeared early one morning at the Censorate office
after it had been renovated. The two ranking Censorate officials had not yet
arrived, so a subordinate greeted the king and facilitated the visit. When the two
officials arrived later and discovered what had happened they petitioned the king
to punish the subordinate for allowing anyone to visit the Censorate when they
were not present. Tran Manh replied that he could go wherever and whenever he
wanted and instructed them to drop the matter. They nevertheless persisted and
became very heated. Although Tran Manh repeatedly told them to stop, they
stubbornly continued the argument until they were finally dismissed. Commoner
officials were beginning to be excessively attached to what they considered to be
the privileges of court appointments.
The increase of educated commoners at court reached a point where many
unauthorized people gained admittance to the royal compound and loitered
about. In1337, an edict specified that all people coming to court must present
their credentials, and that those found without proper identification,“doing
nothing,” were to be expelled. In1342, an edict specified that all officials were
to be reviewed for retention or dismissal, making it clear that they served only at
the pleasure of the king.
From the1340s, Pham Su Manh and Le Quat, two scholars on the1323 list,
became increasingly prominent in royal service. They were both students of Chu
An, the son of an immigrant Chinese and a Vietnamese woman from the
outskirts of Thang Long. Chu An was a highly respected scholar who instead
of entering government service remained a teacher and a critic of public affairs.
Eventually, Tran Manh persuaded him to be the teacher of the young king, Tran
Hao. After Tran Manh’s death, Chu An criticized Tran Hao’s favorites in high
position as disreputable characters and advised that seven of them be beheaded.
When Tran Hao ignored him, he withdrew from the capital and went to live in
retirement at Chi Linh, sixty kilometers east of Thang Long.
Pham Su Manh and Le Quat, like their teacher, were known for their integrity.
They were also competent royal officials who were given important assignments.

However, when they petitioned Tran Manh to“change the system of govern-
ment” to be in accord with their understanding of Confucian principles, Tran
Manh understood them to mean a bureaucratic system such as existed in China
since Song times and reportedly said:“Each country perfects its own pattern;
South and North are different from each other. If I listen to pale-faced scholars
seeking to market their plans, there will be rebellion.”
Despite increasing reliance upon men whose education encouraged a Con-
fucian bias, Tran Manh considered their arguments as excessively drawing
distinctions and establishing unnecessary hierarchies. His bias was toward
the non-duality and sense of inclusiveness that traced back to the thought of
Tran Canh and that had been a core value of Tran leadership for over a
century. In his time, however, there were no external conditions in the form
of a cohesive band of princes to give material expression to this thought.
Instead, he had to work with bickering intellectuals who were full of self-
importance, erudite theories, and their own competing ambitions. The echo
of Tran Canh’s thought that reached him after four generations was
expressed in naïve, sometimes self-effa cing, even simplistic, assertions that
there was nothing to worry about. He instinctively looked beyond the
posturing of his officials to a firm belief that everyone and everything was
in some fundamental way related and that there were no insurmountable
incompatibilities in his kingdom.
For example, a son was born to the Bao Tu queen after Tran Manh had
become king. Since the Bao Tu queen was from the senior line of the Tran
family while Tran Manh’s mother was from the junior line, it could be
claimed that her son ranked ahead of the king. When some sought to give
his half-brother the rank and privileges of a crown prince, he quickly agreed,
despite many officials advising him to think more carefully about it. His reply
to objections was that there was nothing to worry about since he believed that
his half-brother did have a stronger claim than himself and so he was merely
occupying the throne temporarily until the other came of age. The potential
problem foreseen by his advisors never came to pass because the half-brother
died young.
When officials reported to him that there were great numbers of unemployed
people wandering around who did not have families, did not pay taxes, and did
not obey royal edicts, he replied,“If this were not the case, how would I be able
to follow my calling to pacify the realm? You want me to punish these people,
but to achieve what purpose?” He understood that attempting to punish people
in distress would push them into rebellion. He also understood government to be
a process and not a plan to solve everything to perfection. Later historians
considered him to be wise, intelligent, humane, and deeply conservative in

resisting any change to what he had inherited from his forbears. He was also
motivated by a Buddhist, even Daoist, sensibility that was reluctant to take any
unnecessary action for fear of an inevitable and unwanted reaction. He did send
soldiers to attack rebel leaders, but he wanted nothing to do with activist schemes
for disciplining mere unfortunates. He made a point of instructing his sons to be
kind and gentle to their subordinates.
He imagined that the political stability achieved by his fathers would last
forever. He did not know that his world was on the brink of disaster and that
later historians would see his reign as the last sunny era of his dynasty. His was
a time when, despite accumulating worries, the momentum of Tran power
remained a plausible source of confidence and comfort for educated people.
Consequently, books were compiled that mapped the past from a Tran vantage
and took the Tran achievement for granted.
The Thien Uyen Tap Anh(Compiled Extracts about Zen Worthies) was first
arranged some time in the fourteenth century, almost certainly during the reign
of Tran Manh and probably in the1330s. It consists of biographies of monks
and nuns who lived from the sixth to thirteenth centuries in Giao Province/An
Nam/Dai Viet. The intent of the compiler was to document lineages through
which the“mind seal” of enlightenment was passed to the Tran dynasty. It was
modeled upon“transmission of the lamp” texts written during the Tang dynasty
and aimed to show that the Tran had received true Zen doctrine. The last people
mentioned died in the time of Tran Canh who had developed a particular line of
Buddhist thought that became characteristic of Tran royalty. Tran Canh, as well
as his son and grandson, Tran Hoang and Tran Kham, were regarded as Zen
masters by some temple dwellers. Tran Kham spent his last years, died, and was
cremated on Mount Yen Tu, where he propounded the Bamboo Grove (Truc
Lam) School, a short-lived royal sect that later writers associated in various ways
with worthies in theThien Uyen Tap Anh.
In the 1320s, Ly Te Xuyen, the royal librarian of Buddhist texts and sutras,
compiled two books. TheCo Chau Phap Van Phat Bon Hanh Ngu Luc(Record
of What has been Said about the Origin and Deeds of the Cloud Dharma Buddha
at Co Chau) is a history of the cult of the first Buddha in the land, dating from its
origin in the time of Shi Xie at the turn of the third century. It is an accumulation
of materials over a period of a thousand years. The text as it presently exists
contains several“endings” where compilers at particular times finished their
work. The last ending before the eighteenth century contains a description, dated
in1322, of Tran royal officials giving thanks to the Buddha for answering
prayers for rain, and it also gives a description, written by Ly Te Xuyen, of the
new year festival of this Buddha as it was celebrated both at its temple and in
Thang Long.

In 1329, Ly Te Xuyen compiled theViet Dien U Linh Tap(Departed Spirits in
the Vietnamese Realm). This book contains biographies of twenty-seven deities
beginning with Shi Xie and ending with cults established during the Ly dynasty.
These deities were considered to have responded to the prayers of Tran kings to
grant success to their armies during the Mongol Wars and the1312 expedition to
Champa. Information is cited from earlier texts and from oral tradition about the
spirits worshipped by Tran kings as guardian deities of the kingdom. Titles
conferred on the deities by Tran kings in gratitude for their protection of the
realm are recorded.
These works view the Tran dynasty as sustained by the divine forces that
govern human affairs and by the wisdom of correct teaching about the Buddha.
The rising class of scholars included those inclined to look askance at what they
perceived as superstition, corruption, or wastefulness among the adherents of
Buddhism. However, at least until the death of Tran Manh in1357, they knew
that they served a king who venerated the Buddha. Tran Manh was inclined to
dismiss their ideas about how to organize society and government but appreci-
ated their loyalty and competence. He shrank from interfering in the existing
scheme of things to bring change but dutifully intervened, when necessary, to
restore order.
Agrarian unrest, Tran Hao, and Nhat Le
While royalty and literati maintained the forms of dynastic rule, an undercurrent
of agrarian distress gathered momentum. The post-war famine of1290–1292 had
initiated a pattern of land being absorbed into the estates of royal family members
and of peasants shifting into the status of royal slaves. Land once transferred to
royal estates was never returned, but people who had sold themselves into slavery
were given a term in which to redeem themselves. This term came to an end in
1299, after which redemptions were no longer allowed. Rural poverty was
endemic. In 1303, Tran Kham summoned an assembly of wealthy people to
contribute money to the poor. At the same assembly he initiated a program to
distribute copies of a sutra to the common people for their edification, indicating
that he and others viewed poverty as both a material and a moral issue.
The rise of slavery apparently led to disputes on royal estates, for in1315 an
edict forbad mutual denunciations among fathers and children, husbands and
wives, and family slaves. Without more information, it is impossible to under-
stand the situation being addressed, but in1320 an edict forbad false claims of
ownership over fields, indicating continued litigation over control of land. There
is no indication of whether such litigation was between disputing aristocratic

family members or between aristocrats and their slaves or peasants. Whatever
the case, it is clear that the agrarian regime was not stable.
There was drought in1315, and in1317 it was recorded that banditry was a
growing problem. In 1326 there was no rain. In1333, there was flood and
famine. In 1337, granaries were organized to feed the hungry. The following
year, floods washed away crops and a big windstorm blew down trees and
houses. These troubles were not out of the ordinary; a certain level of rural
misery was normal. But the expansion of aristocratic estates and of slavery on
those estates significantly reduced the capacity of rural society to respond flexibly
to economic distress. In the1340s the agrarian regime fell into a prolonged crisis
that produced rebel armies.
A drought in1343 initiated a famine that lasted for three years. There was no
harvest that year, and the court reduced taxes by half. Many people turned to
banditry, especially slaves on royal estates. When the famine continued in1344,
people continued to join bandit gangs, and many who did not want to do that
became monks and entered the temples. A rebel leader named Ngo Be assembled
an army in the eastern plain near modern Dong Trieu and Mao Khe. Tran
officials organized local military units to fight bandits and sent soldiers against
Ngo Be. In1345, Ngo Be’s army was defeated, but he continued his career as a
rebel leader, and the famine also continued. An edict reduced the punishments
for many crimes to encourage the surrender of bandits and rebels. In1348 there
was more drought and flooding. Rebels accumulated in the provinces of Thai
Nguyen and Lang Son in the northern mountains and were not pacified until
1351. Then, in1352, the dike on the Red River below Thang Long broke and
flooded a vast region southeast of the capital.
In 1354, another famine brought misery to the rural population. Insects
destroyed the harvest, and another50 percent tax reduction was proclaimed.
A fresh outbreak of banditry contributed to the formation of another rebel army,
this time led by one claiming to be a descendent of Tran Quoc Tuan. This man
rallied large numbers of royal slaves and occupied extensive territories from his
base at Van Kiep. In that year, news arrived from the northern border that a son
of the traitor Tran Ich Tac intended to attack with an army he was raising in
China, which at that time was rent by war as the Mongol regime was in collapse.
Nothing came of this, but it added to the sense of unease in Thang Long, as did
reports of the foreboding appearance of a wild black tiger in the palace complex.
In1355, there was drought and also floods.
In 1356, amidst these unsettling events, Tran Manh, perhaps seeking some
mercy for himself and his tormented kingdom, visited the tomb of Tran Quoc
Chan, the father of his senior queen whom he had unjustly condemned to death
three decades earlier. While returning to Thang Long by boat he was stung by a

bee on his left cheek and fell ill. Despite the efforts of doctors and the prayers of
his entourage he died six months later, in early1357.
Rural unrest continued as Tran Hao, a young man of 21, and not very
interested in government, became the only king. In1358, there was drought,
crops were infested with insects, and fish died of pestilence. The court’s response
was an appeal to wealthy people to give rice to the hungry. Ngo Be reappeared at
the head of a rebel army. From his base at Chi Linh, he controlled the north-
eastern part of the plain and adjacent uplands. The court ordered the mobiliza-
tion of soldiers to fight the rebels. In1359, floods washed away entire villages
along with crops. In1360, Ngo Be was finally captured and killed along with
thirty of his lieutenants. In that year an edict required slaves belonging to royal
family members to be tattooed on their foreheads. Anyone found without this
tattoo would be treated as a rebel, which implies that the options available to
many were now either slavery or rebellion. In1362, drought again led to crop
failure, a50 percent reduction in taxes, and appeals for rich people to feed the
hungry. To set an example, even the king distributed food. Banditry and rebel-
lion continued. In1366, robbers attacked the king himself as he traveled in the
countryside at night, and took his royal seal and sword.
Meanwhile the situation on the southern frontier was grim. In1356, shortly
before his fatal bee sting, Tran Manh took Tran Hao on a two-month inspection
tour of the southern provinces. Cham relations were deteriorating at this time
and efforts to maintain communications with the frontier were urgent; within a
year orders went out to dredge and upgrade the canals and waterways in the
southern provinces. In1361 Cham sea raiders were fought off in modern Quang
Binh. In1361, Cham raiders plundered the Hue area and seized many captives.
Cham raiders were repulsed in1366, and the following year more soldiers were
sent south to engage the Chams. In1368, Cham envoys demanded the return of
territories that the Tran had acquired with the ill-fated royal marriage alliance of
1305. The Tran response to this demand was to send an army to attack into
modern Quang Nam, where it was repulsed.
Soldiers were also mobilized to watch the northern border. The founder of the
Ming dynasty was expanding his power in southern China, and the Mongol
Yuan dynasty was no longer able to police the border, which inspired disorders.
In1359, Ming envoys appeared in Thang Long for the first time. The Tran sent
officials north to investigate what was happening. In1361, Thang Long politely
refused a Ming request to send soldiers to help fight the Mongols. In1368, Ming
envoys arrived to announce their new dynasty and Tran envoys were sent to
establish normal relations.
Tran Hao paid little attention to the internal disorders and external threats of
the 1360s. Before he died, Tran Manh had made Tran Hao’s mother, Queen

Hien Tu, promise to remain in the palace and not withdraw to a nunnery. He
must have foreseen that Tran Hao was not competent to be king and hoped that
she would exert a positive influence on him. Tran Hao was mainly interested in
money, amusements, and drinking. In a thinly veiled scheme to gain cash, he
summoned rich people to come to the palace to gamble with him. On another
occasion, he found a pretext to confiscate the property of a wealthy pearl
merchant.
Many people were gaining access to the palace by virtue of their wealth or
entertainment value. One man was given a rank at court simply for performing a
trick in which he appeared to drink huge amounts of wine. Tran Hao ordered all
members of the royal family to send their opera troupes to his palace; he spent
much time watching the Yuan-style opera (tuong) that had become fashionable
after the Mongol Wars. He also restored Trau Canh to the rank and privileges of
which Tran Manh had deprived him. This clever doctor, hated by Tran Manh to
his dying breath, had been closely associated with Tran Hao from the time he
had revived the prince at the age of3 from a near drowning accident. Trau
Canh’s return to the palace was typical of a time when sycophants and adven-
turers gained ascendancy at Tran Hao’s court. In a collection of tales compiled a
century later entitledLinh Nam Chich Quai(Strange Tales Collected South of
the Mountains) can be found a story of a young man, supposedly the son of a
divine father and a human mother, who became a favorite of Tran Hao and
made a career as a sexual predator until he was killed by a Tran nobleman.
In 1364, Tran Hao went for a drunken swim in the river at night and fell sick.
Trau Canh mixed medicines for him and he was cured after two months. But he
did not abate his heedless way of life. His nocturnal encounter with robbers in
1366, however, reportedly gave him an intimation that he did not have long to
live, in response to which he indulged all his favorite dissipations until his death
in1369 at the age of33. He had no children. It fell to his mother, Queen Hien
Tu, to mobilize the court behind a successor.
Hien Tu was a niece of Tran Kham and the ranking woman at court. After the
death of her father, Tran Quoc Chan, she had borne Tran Manh three children,
two sons and a daughter. Tran Hao had been the second son. For unrecorded
reasons, the eldest son, Tran Duc, had not been considered a good choice to be
king. He apparently loved the theatre as much as his brother did, for he married
an actress who was known as Vuong Mau, meaning“Royal Mother,” because
she was famous for performing that role in the opera. It did not matter to Tran
Duc that she was already married to an actor named Duong Khuong, nor did it
matter to him that she happened to be pregnant with a child of Duong Khuong at
the time he married her. She gave birth to a son named Nhat Le. Tran Duc, who
had no children of his own, adopted Nhat Le as his own son. By the time Tran

Duc died in1364, Vuong Mau and Nhat Le were established in the palace as
members of royalty.
When Tran Hao died, Nhat Le was the ostensible male heir of Tran Manh by
Hien Tu, his only Tran wife. Nhat Le’s age is not known, but he could not have
been out of his teens. There were three sons of Tran Manh who had established
reputations as competent members of the royal family: Tran Nguyen Trac,50
years old; Tran Phu,48 years old; and Tran Kinh,33 years old. However, none
of their mothers was a Tran woman. Hien Tu officially recognized Nhat Le as
her grandson and the legitimate successor to the throne. Despite Nhat Le’s
questionable pedigree, she followed the Tran dynastic rule of succession, for
which her father had paid with his life. She is recorded as saying:“Duc was the
eldest son of the legal wife. He was not able to be king and died young. Is not
Nhat Le his son?”
Hien Tu had a reputation for being strictly fair in her relations with the women
and children of the palace and for seeking to avoid conflict. Once, when Tran
Manh was still alive, evidence surfaced that one of the palace women was using
magic to bring harm to Hien Tu’s children. When Tran Manh wanted to bring
the matter into the open and apply punishments, she persuaded him to let it pass
because the woman in question was the daughter of a prominent Tran prince,
and she valued harmony in the royal family above all else. She had accepted Nhat
Le as the legitimate heir of her son Tran Duc, and she was not prepared to shirk
from the implications of this when Tran Hao died.
Nhat Le was raised to the throne. Tran Nguyen Trac was given a high
appointment at court, and a daughter of Tran Phu was made queen. Six months
later, Nhat Le killed Hien Tu when she expressed regret for his having become
king. Nhat Le was reportedly a lascivious drunkard who spent his time in
idleness watching opera. In this he may not have been very different from Tran
Hao. What was most demoralizing to the Tran nobles and court officials, and
what probably turned Hien Tu against him, was that he began to talk about
changing the dynastic name to Duong, the surname of his real father. This was a
repudiation of his adoption by Tran Duc and an unacceptable threat to the
existence of the Tran royal family. Resistance to him gathered around the senior
Tran princes.
Tran Phu
Nine months after the death of Hien Tu, a group of Tran nobles led by Tran
Nguyen Trac advanced into the palace to depose Nhat Le. Nhat Le escaped over
a wall and hid under a bridge. His pursuers could not find him and dispersed.

Nhat Le then gathered his followers and sent them to track down and kill his
enemies, eighteen men in all, including not only Tran Nguyen Trac and his son,
but also two sons of Hien Tu’s daughter Ngoc Pha. This signaled open war
between Nhat Le and the Tran royal family.
Tran Phu retrieved his daughter from the palace and fled to the safety of his
mother’s family in Thanh Hoa. Tran Kinh also fled thither, for his mother and Tran
Phu’s mother were sisters. A nephew of these sisters, Le Quy Ly, was the leader of
the family. They were joined by Tran Nguyen Dan, a great-grandson of TranQuang
Khai, and by Hien Tu’s daughter Ngoc Pha. All the soldiers that Nhat Le sent from
Thang Long against these people joined them instead of attacking them.
Tran Phu was the senior member of the group. Everyone looked to him for
leadership, but he was diffident. Ngoc Pha and others urged him forward. After
several days of hesitation he set out for Thang Long with Ngoc Pha and Tran
Kinh at his side, leading a growing army of Tran followers. When they arrived at
Vu Ban, about fifteen kilometers southwest of Nam Dinh, Tran Phu was pro-
claimed king and an edict was published dethroning Nhat Le.
On the occasion of proclaiming his accession at Vu Ban, Tran Phu is reported
to have said:
Formerly, our court established the country with its own governing
system and did not follow the regulations of Song, for in the north and
in the south each ruler has his own kingdom and they did not imitate each
other. In the Dai Tri era [1358–1369], pale-faced scholars were used in
public service who did not understand the exact purpose of drawing up
laws, and all the old laws of our ancestors were changed to go toward
northern customs; whether it be things like clothing or like music, they
are too many to count. Consequently, we will now begin to govern
according to the regulations in the Khai Thai era [1324–1328].
This remarkable statement rallied members of the Tran aristocracy who flocked
to join Tran Phu in his triumphal march on Thang Long. It analyzed the troubles
in the country as the result of excessive northern influence instigated by educated
commoners.
Tran Phu singled out the time of Tran Hao as the time when northern influ-
ence threatened the Tran dynastic legacy. He believed that the scholars, with
their arguments based on northern books, did not understand how the southern
country really worked. Only the Tran princes understood this because, after all,
their house had established the country, and the country belonged to them. They
had more at stake in governing the country than did the scholars, whose ideas
about government were detached from loyalty to any particular dynasty.
Whether in the ephemera of opera, medicine, sorcery, dress, music, or in the
stiffer legal framework that disciplined a society, Tran Phu and the people

around him were convinced that change had destroyed the basis of their coun-
try’s strength and prosperity. The unrest and rebellion that had broken out since
the 1340s, the inability to maintain ascendancy over the Chams, and the fact that
a traitor had been nurtured in the bosom of the dynasty were all indications that
something had gone wrong.
Tran Phu proposed to go back to the time before the death of Tran Quoc Chan
in 1328. That event had resulted in a king whose mother was not a Tran woman.
The premature death of this king, Tran Vuong, unexplained in the records, may
well have been the work of people who sought to rectify that event after a
grandson of Tran Quoc Chan, Tran Hao, was available for the throne. With
the failure of Hien Tu’s experiment to legitimize Nhat Le by adoption, there were
no surviving male heirs of Tran Manh with Tran mothers. Nothing could be
done about that. In fact, Tran Phu was able to restore a semblance of the Tran
heritage because he could call upon the resources of his mother’s family in Thanh
Hoa. As it turned out, this was the most important aspect of the events in1370,
for Le Quy Ly, the leader of his mother’s family, spent the next thirty years
gradually gaining control of the country until he was in a position to completely
destroy the Tran dynasty.
Tran Phu with his entourage and army entered Thang Long in triumph. Nhat
Le offered no resistance to his demotion, but then he strangled a Tran nobleman
who had remained with him as a secret agent of Tran Phu, and because of this he
was killed. For the next four months, in late1370 and early1371, Tran Phu and
his followers were busy celebrating and thinking about how to set things right.
Chu An came out of his retirement to congratulate Tran Phu, then died soon
after. Tran Nguyen Dan, the next most senior Tran prince, was a literary man
and had deep respect for Chu An. Despite the repeatedly expressed scorn of Tran
noblemen for“pale-faced scholars” with their schemes for reforming govern-
ance, many of these men were nevertheless valued for their loyalty and learning.
Furthermore, many scholars were dismayed by the leadership of Tran Hao and
of Nhat Le and were ready allies of Tran Phu.
Le Quat, one of Chu An’s disciples, wrote an inscription at this time that
expresses his respect for how Buddhism had penetrated people of all social
classes, for how eagerly people contributed their money and possessions to the
temples and monasteries, and for how temples were to be found everywhere and
were constantly being repaired or renovated. In comparison with this, he
expresses his embarrassment that, although he had spent his youth studying
the sages of antiquity and how to instruct the people in proper behavior, there
was not yet even one hamlet that followed these teachings and nowhere in the
land could he find a school or shrine that was dedicated to classical learning. This
reveals that scholars were intellectually alienated from the mainstream of Tran

society and culture, which remained focused on Buddhist temples. They earned a
place in dynastic affairs with their literary skills, their competence, and their
loyalty. Despite Le Quat’s gloomy inscription, which apparently described con-
ditions in the countryside, Truong Han Sieu, who had died in1354, was honored
at a shrine to Confucius in Thang Long in1372. When dynastic affairs fell into
disarray in the late fourteenth century, the scholars were in a position to increase
their role in government and society.
Tran Phu had time to celebrate his birthday festival and to abolish two laws
from Tran Hao’s time before an unexpected disaster struck. One law had
regulated the reclamation of land from the sea by Tran nobles and one had
provided that when a man died his property would be inventoried for royal
inspection and potential confiscation. Abolishing these laws removed ways for a
greedy king to bite into the aristocracy’s freedom to amass land and wealth. But
the agenda of re-establishing the prerogatives of the Tran nobles was suddenly
superseded by calamity.
Nhat Le’s mother had fled to the Cham king Che Bong Nga and, seeking
revenge against the Tran lords, suggested to him that following the recent
turmoil the situation at Thang Long was an opportunity. In spring of1371,
Che Bong Nga led his seaborne forces up the Red River to plunder Thang Long.
He burned down the city along with the palaces before withdrawing unscathed.
The Tran were caught completely off guard and no defense was offered against
this attack.
Tran Phu had no heart for dealing with this crisis. Within days, he elevated his
half-brother, 34-year-old Tran Kinh, to be crown prince. A year and a half later,
Tran Kinh was made king and Tran Phu became senior king. The next few years
were spent in mobilizing the resources of the kingdom to send armies into the
south. Tran Kinh was the leading spirit in this endeavor and made it clear,
despite protests from officials at court, that he would lead the soldiers in person.
Le Quy Ly
Tran Kinh’s rising profile as leader of the royal family was accompanied by the
appearance of Le Quy Ly, his maternal cousin, at a high level of government.
Within two months of the Cham invasion, Le Quy Ly was put in charge of the
Privy Council and given as wife a Tran princess who had been widowed by Nhat
Le. Tran Kinh, in turn, took a woman of the Le family as his queen. In autumn
1371, Le Quy Ly was given a title of nobility and sent to inspect the southern
border regions. From his family base in Thanh Hoa, he became the master of the
southern provinces and the frontier jurisdictions.

Thang Long palaces were rebuilt in a rustic manner with labor from royal
slaves so as not to trouble the rest of the population, which was being mobilized
for military purposes. Bandits and drought interfered with and delayed military
preparations, but gradually transportation routes into the south were put in
order, weapons were manufactured, soldiers were trained, rice was requisitioned,
and officers were selected. Tran Kinh was single-mindedly focused upon
obtaining revenge for Che Bong Nga’s sack of Thang Long.
By early1376, Tran Kinh was poised to lead his armies south. Le Quy Ly was
in charge of gathering supplies from the southern provinces and transporting
them down the coast for the campaign. Do Tu Binh, a high official who in1372
was given overall responsibility for military affairs, was sent to the southernmost
Tran jurisdiction, in modern Thua Thien Province, to repulse Cham patrols and
report on the situation at the border. It was later rumored that Che Bong Nga
sent a large amount of gold to Tran Kinh and expressed a willingness to settle
matters peacefully, but Do Tu Binh pocketed the gold and reported to Tran Kinh
that Che Bong Nga’s colossal insolence required punishment. This was what
Tran Kinh wanted to hear, for he had nurtured a consuming anger toward Che
Bong Nga.
Tran Kinh embarked his army at Thang Long and went by sea to the Giang
River in what is now northern Quang Binh Province. From there he led his army
on horseback, pausing for a month at modern Dong Hoi to train and reorganize
his troops and to gather prisoners from the Cham population fleeing south. After
a month of marching, he arrived before the Cham capital of Vijaya, near the
modern city of Qui Nhon. Che Bong Nga enticed him into attacking what he
thought was a deserted encampment. After an argument with one of his generals
who suspected a trap, he excitedly led his soldiers forward. In a rush of exuber-
ance, his men melted into an undisciplined mob, which the Chams ambushed and
utterly defeated. Tran Kinh and three of his generals were killed. Do Tu Binh, in
command of the rearguard, abandoned the field and fled north for his life. When
the news reached Le Quy Ly, he hastened back to Thang Long.
The death of Tran Kinh in early1377 reopened the issue of dynastic leader-
ship. Tran Phu had two adult sons. Tran Ngac had been assigned to patrol
modern Thai Nguyen Province, in the foothills north of Thang Long, a notorious
gathering place for bandits and rebels. His brother Tran Huc had accompanied
Tran Kinh’s expedition and had not returned. Exercising his accustomed diffi-
dence, and perhaps also revealing what subsequently became his habit of defer-
ring to the suggestions of Le Quy Ly, Tran Phu passed over Tran Ngac and
instead raised to the throne his16-year-old nephew, a son of Tran Kinh named
Tran Hien, whom later historians evaluated as muddleheaded. A daughter of
Tran Phu, Thuc My, was married to Tran Hien and made his queen. In the midst

of sorting out these dynastic arrangements, Che Bong Nga arrived by sea and
found a way past coastal defenses to suddenly ascend the Red River. He once
again plundered Thang Long before disappearing back into the sea.
In early1378, Tran Hien celebrated his birthday festival amidst urgent efforts
to manufacture more weapons and war boats. Tran Huc appeared in Nghe An
married to a Cham princess and claiming to be king. Allied with Che Bong Nga
he rallied many people in the southern provinces to his side. Che Bong Nga
arrived in the lower Red River plain with an army. Do Tu Binh was sent to stop
him but could not. The Chams plundered Thang Long for the third time.
During the next six years, with neither of the kings capable of providing
leadership, Le Quy Ly and a group of men associated with him struggled to keep
the Chams out of Thang Long. The treasury was empty but money was needed to
train, equip, and supply soldiers. To increase revenue and military manpower,
the basis of taxation was shifted from land to households. Following the equal
field system of the Tang dynasty, able-bodied men were organized into military
units, assigned land, and taxed on a per capita basis. The old system in which
taxes were levied only on land was not functioning because so much land had
disappeared into the estates of royal family members who did not pay taxes. The
new system was also designed to stem the flow of impoverished peasants into the
ranks of slaves on royal estates. This was the first step in what would be a long-
term policy of Le Quy Ly to build a socio-economic base beyond Tran
aristocratic control.
In 1379, despite drought, famine, fears of Cham attacks, and a major rebellion
in the northeast of the Red River plain, enough taxes were collected that soldiers
were assigned to transport money to the mountains for safekeeping. In1380, the
Chams, who then firmly controlled the frontier region of modern Quang Binh,
Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Provinces, tightened their grip on Nghe An and
attacked into Thanh Hoa. Le Quy Ly led armies south and, gaining victories,
pushed the Chams back into the borderlands. In1381, a local leader in Nghe An
was executed for having served the Chams, as was Tran Huc, Tran Phu’s son
who had rallied support in the southern provinces behind his alliance with Che
Bong Nga.
Despite some victories in the field, Tran resources were near exhaustion and
the Cham threat remained unabated. In1381, Buddhist leaders were sent to
mobilize all able-bodied monks both from temple monasteries and from moun-
tain retreats to temporarily serve as soldiers against the Chams. Statuary and
other treasures from temples and shrines in the lower Red River plain were taken
and stored for safekeeping in the mountains. In1382, the Chams again attacked
into Thanh Hoa but were repulsed after desperate fighting by Nguyen Da
Phuong, a protégé of Le Quy Ly.

In 1383, Le Quy Ly sent a fleet of large new ships down the coast. They did not
advance far, being damaged in a storm, but nevertheless did prevent Cham
attacks by sea. Instead, Che Bong Nga led his army through the mountains of
Thanh Hoa to emerge into the Red River plain west of Thang Long. A general
sent by Tran Phu against him was captured and Che Bong Nga closed in on
Thang Long as Nguyen Da Phuong hastily built and garrisoned a defensive
“fence” to protect the city. Amidst heavy fighting, Tran Phu fled across the river
and took refuge at Bao Hoa Palace, which was located beside Phat Tich Temple,
around twelve kilometers northeast of Thang Long near modern Tien Son. There
he spent his time compiling a book of instructions for the young king.
Nguyen Da Phuong’s defense of Thang Long was successful and the Chams
withdrew. Thereafter, Che Bong Nga did not threaten the Tran capital for six
years, although fighting continued along the southern coast. At Thang Long, Le
Quy Ly and his growing entourage made decisions as the young king and people
near him gnawed powerlessly on their resentment. Tran Phu remained at Bao
Hoa Palace. Among other things, he supervised an examination held at Phat Tich
Temple that graduated thirty men in1384.
The other senior Tran prince, Tran Nguyen Dan, went into retreat at Mount
Con near Chi Linh on the northeastern edge of the plain. He clearly perceived
that the Tran dynasty was nearing its end but saw no way to prevent this. He was
in his sixties and had made his peace with Le Quy Ly, marrying his son to Le Quy
Ly’s stepdaughter, who in giving birth to two grandsons thereby ensured that his
posterity would survive beyond the age of Tran. The strongest words that he had
about the fate of his dynasty were in two lines of poetry:“From past to present,
prosperity and decline can truly be seen; Gentlemen, how can it be endured that
remonstrations are so few?” Tran noblemen were paralyzed by the daunting
disorders of the time, their lack of strong leaders, and the ambition of Le Quy Ly
that put him far ahead of any rival. Tran Ngac, who in1377 had been passed
over for the throne, commiserated with Tran Nguyen Dan with a poem that said:
“I was tossed aside years ago; You are not a great talent in our house; It happens
that we are alike in being old and weak; Fields and gardens will soon revert back
to nature.”
Tran Nguyen Dan, although without political ability, was nevertheless a tal-
ented poet and, until his death in1390, kept about him a circle of like-minded
literary men. One of his later marks of note was that in1380 he became the
grandfather of Nguyen Trai, the most prominent scholar, poet, and statesman of
the early fifteenth century. Nguyen Trai’s father, Nguyen Phi Khanh, as an aspir-
ing young scholar, was employed as the tutor of one of Tran Nguyen Dan’s
daughters. When she became pregnant, her father allowed Nguyen Phi Khanh to

marry her. However, Tran Phu, the senior king, was offended by this marriage of
a Tran noblewoman with a commoner and barred Nguyen Phi Khanh from any
appointment at court. Nguyen Phi Khanh later followed Le Quy Ly.
In 1387, Tran Phu returned to Thang Long from his sojourn of nearly four
years at the Bao Hoa Palace. His presence in the capital emboldened the27-year-
old king, Tran Hien, to plot against Le Quy Ly. Learning of this, in1388 Le Quy
Ly manipulated Tran Phu into deposing Tran Hien and replacing him with his
youngest son,10-year-old Tran Ngung, once again passing over Tran Ngac.
A daughter of Le Quy Ly was made the queen. Tran Hien and all his co-
conspirators were killed.
In 1389, more secure after being rid of Tran Hien, Le Quy Ly appointed to
high positions at court a group of eleven scholars of whose loyalty he was sure.
By mid year, however, rebellions in Thanh Hoa opened the way for a new Cham
invasion. Le Quy Ly led an army into Thanh Hoa but was defeated, after which
Tran Phu lost confidence in his battlefield skills. When Le Quy Ly returned to
Thang Long to obtain reinforcements, Tran Phu relieved him of further military
duty and instead appointed Tran Khat Chan, a descendent of Tran Binh Trong,
the famous martyr of the Mongol Wars, to lead soldiers against the Chams. Le
Quy Ly’s prestige had suffered sufficiently that Nguyen Da Phuong, his former
associate who had kept the Chams out of Thang Long in1383, dared to publicly
oppose him until forced to commit suicide. Then, a monk suddenly appeared at
the head of a rebel army from northwest of Thang Long. The two kings fled
north of the Red River as the rebel army flooded into Thang Long. Tran Phu
called on a general who had been campaigning against Chams and their allies in
the mountains west of Thang Long to suppress this uprising. For a few critical
months, Tran Phu demonstrated a hint of the leadership for which his ancestors
were famous.
Tran Khat Chan, although repulsed in Thanh Hoa, retreated in good order to
the southern Red River plain. There, in early1390, benefiting from information
given by a Cham turncoat, Che Bong Nga’s boat was identified and ambushed
with firearms, the first recorded use of firearms in Vietnam. Che Bong Nga was
killed and his followers fled south. The Cham wars ended after twenty years.
During that time, the people in the territories of modern Quang Binh, Quang Tri,
and Thua Tien had mostly followed the Chams. The people in Nghe An and Ha
Tinh had been divided with about half following the Chams. Officials and
soldiers were sent from Thang Long into these areas to re-establish Tran author-
ity and to administer a round of rewards and punishments.
With the lifting of the Cham cloud, Le Quy Ly regained his momentum. In
1391, he personally led soldiers down to the vicinity of modern Hue on the

border. He sent an army to penetrate into Cham territory, but it was decisively
defeated and he returned to Thang Long. This reminder of past defeats and of Le
Quy Ly’s skill in turning disaster for the country into personal success encour-
aged criticism from many quarters, despite the fact that Le Quy Ly’s spies and
agents seemed to be everywhere.
When an official drew attention to a song sung by children in the streets of
Thang Long that suggested Le Quy Ly was coveting the throne, the official was
forced to go into hiding. Two officials in a province far from Thang Long had a
conversation in which they expressed dismay at how Le Quy Ly was acting as the
king; the conversation was reported to Le Quy Ly and the two men were killed.
A Tran nobleman was killed for plotting to kill Le Quy Ly. Tran Ngac, Tran
Phu’s son, had been on the edge of several conspiracies against Le Quy Ly. He
thought that he should be the king and was a focus for Tran resentment against
Le Quy Ly. Fearing for his life, he fled from the capital, was caught in the
countryside, and was killed.
In 1392, having disposed of all immediate enemies, Le Quy Ly published a
book that propounded his version of the Confucian canon. The Duke of Zhou,
who loyally served a young king in antiquity, was“the first sage.” Second in
importance was Confucius, “the first teacher,” whose Analects Le Quy Ly
criticized passages for where Confucius appears to show lack of attention to
ethical and practical matters (visiting a lewd woman, talking with rebels, failing
to bring along enough food while traveling). The Tang philosopher Han Yu
(768–824) is praised, apparently because of his practical attention to the import-
ance of a strong central government and his criticism of Buddhism as a waste of
manpower and resources. On the other hand, the line of Song philosophers from
Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), Cheng Yi (1033–1107), Yang Shi (1053–1135), La
Congyan (1072–1135), Li Tong (1093–1163), and Zhu Xi (1130–1200)i s
described as erudite but with little ability, not sufficiently attached to actual
facts, skilled only in collecting bits and pieces from ancient texts. Le Quy Ly
proposed that action is more important than thought and that his model for
action was the Duke of Zhou who accepted the responsibilities of kingship
during a time when the king was too young to do so. He did not share the
disdain of Tran royalty for“pale-faced scholars,” but he wanted an intellectual
agenda that was under his control.
Given the curriculum followed in previous generations, which accepted the
teachings of the Song philosophers, this was a change in ideology that was sure to
provoke unease among some scholars. A teacher in the royal academy had the
temerity to publicly disagree with Le Quy Ly’s book and was consequently
demoted. Le Quy Ly immediately moved to reorient education toward his ideas.

An examination in1393 produced thirty new graduates and was followed by
another examination for officials who already had appointments, apparently to
reinforce the perspective of the new book.
An even larger difficulty in Le Quy Ly’s new emphasis would seem to be that,
with a senior king at hand, there ought to be no need for a“Duke of Zhou” to
assist the young king, Tran Ngung, then in his early teens. In1394, however,
Tran Phu,73 years old, set this worry to rest by presenting a painting to Le Quy
Ly that demonstrated his approval of Le Quy Ly’s new conceit. The painting was
entitled “Four Helpers” and depicted four ministers of state in times past who
were famous for helping young kings: the Duke of Zhou himself, who helped
Zhou Cheng in the eleventh centurybce; Hua Guang, who helped Han Zhao in
the first centurybce; Zhuge Liang, who helped Liu Shan in the third centuryce;
and To Hien Thanh, who helped Ly Long Trat in the twelfth century.
A month after this painting was shown in public, Tran Phu reportedly had a
dream in which he saw his half-brother Tran Kinh, the former king, leading his
army and reciting a poem:“In the center is no one but the marquis with a red
snout; He is about to climb up into the tower of the white chicken; The decision
of whether the kingdom will prosper or perish has already been made; It is not
in front of you but behind you.” Reference to the“red snout” and to the“white
chicken” indicated Le Quy Ly and Tran Phu, respectively, based on horoscopes
and puns. The “tower” was the throne. The last two lines affirmed that it
was already determined that the Tran were about to perish. It is recorded that
Tran Phu brooded over this dream and was troubled by it, but that he saw no
way out.
Another month passed and, after the annual blood oath was administered, Le
Quy Ly met with Tran Phu, who is reported to have said:“You and I are of the
same family. Together we are in charge of the country’s affairs. Now the
country’s strength is declining, and I am an old man. After I depart this life, if
the king can be helped, then help him; but if he shows no merit, then take the
throne for yourself.” He understood what was happening and, despite his
personal dismay, publicly blessed it. Four months later, he died.
Tran Phu had passed from the family of his father to the“same family” that he
shared with Le Quy Ly, the family of his mother. Whereas Ly Sam had marked
the end his dynasty by turning away from his mother’s family, the end of Tran
Phu’s was marked by turning toward his mother’s family. The Ly dynasty
developed an experiment in governance by maternal families. The Tran dynasty
was an experiment in excluding non-royal maternal families from access to the
throne. Both experiments worked for a few generations and both ultimately
failed.

There is no way to know whether the tremble of doubt that passed briefly
through the mind of Tran Phu after dreaming of his brother was the last quiver of
courage radiating from the deeds of his ancestors, or a shudder of loathing at
how he had betrayed his own bright hopes on that day in Vu Ban nearly twenty-
five years before when he was proclaimed king, or simply the anxiety provoked
by the approach of death. His brother’s ghost came to comfort him. The outcome
of the Tran story had been determined, and he could die in peace.

4 THE LE DYNASTY
Destruction of the Tran aristocracy
The fortunes of the Ly and Tran dynasties waxed and waned in step with the
Song and Yuan dynasties. There was a vital connection between regimes in the
Red River plain and the successors to the northern dynasties that had governed
there during earlier centuries. Both sides carefully observed the tributary rela-
tionship. Books, medicine, theater, music, weapons, and government policies in
the north were easily perceived, understood, and adopted in the south. Disorders
and political troubles in the south were monitored and any potential for requir-
ing or enabling intervention was evaluated in the north.
In both the Song–Ly cycle and the Yuan–Tran cycle, the rise of the northern
dynasty was accompanied by the rise of the southern dynasty, and the decline of
the northern dynasty was accompanied by the decline of the southern dynasty. The
relative sizes of the two sides ensured that initiative in the relationship came from
the north. The role of the south was to answer northern initiative. Moments of
warfare climaxed both cycles, the outcomes of which confirmed the general basis
of the relationship between vassal and suzerain. The ebbs and flows of power and
prosperity in the north and in the south reveal that, in the eleventh and thirteenth
centuries, northern challenges evoked southern responses. Similarly, in the twelfth
and fourteenth centuries, northern weakness gave slack to the relationship and led
to weakness in the south.
In the late fourteenth century, the rise of the Ming dynasty fundamentally
altered the strategic and cultural environment in eastern Asia. The Ming rulers
redefined civilization and the sphere of government while at the same time they
sought to restore the borders and to equal the glories of the Han and Tang
Empires. Early Ming policies are commonly considered to be conservative and
expansionist in aiming to erase the humiliation of Mongol rule by reanimating the
Han–Tang imperial legacy. The result was a centralizing mobilization of human
and material resources that led to extending Ming rule over neighboring regions.

At the same time, and not by coincidence, there was a fundamental change in
the structure of politics among Vietnamese speakers with a strong effort to
centralize control of resources. However, this was insufficient to prevent the
Ming from asserting regional dominance and restoring imperial government in
the lands of old Giao Chi and An Nam. Although the Ming would eventually
abandon this ambitious policy and return to a reformulation of the tributary
relationship, the Vietnamese regime that emerged from these tumultuous events
was shaped not only by the challenge from the north, but also by an internal shift
of power away from the Red River plain and into the southern provinces, with
dramatic consequences for the structure of dynastic government. Le Quy Ly was
the first Vietnamese leader to respond to the Ming challenge and to envision a
new future for Vietnamese government.
Le Quy Ly traced his ancestry to an immigrant of the Ho surname who in the
late 940s came from Zhejiang Province on China’s east coast and received an
appointment as governor of the province in the Ca River basin, presumably from
Duong Tam Kha, who was endeavoring to rule at that time. Leaders in subse-
quent generations of the Ho family served as commanders of an outpost in that
province and on one occasion were honored with marriage to a Ly princess. In
the thirteenth century, a branch of the family moved to the region of modern
Vinh Loc district, beside the Ma River in the foothills of Thanh Hoa Province. It
was adopted into the clan of a local strongman with the Le surname. Le Quy Ly,
born in1336, was in the fourth generation with this surname. Although infor-
mation is lacking, the family probably earned merit with the Tran kings during
the Mongol Wars, for two of Le Quy Ly’s aunts had entered the palace in the
early fourteenth century as consorts of Tran Manh.
Le Quy Ly was well educated, a writer of both prose and poetry. He promoted
writing and reading in the vernacular. He learned how to organize and lead
armies, with some successes yet many failures on battlefields. But he was first of
all an astute politician who spent most of his adult life preoccupied with the
question of dynastic change. He was ruthless yet rational. He imposed radical
solutions upon a society that in the1370s could no longer protect itself. He did
not care if he was hated so long as he was obeyed. With great energy and
willpower he laid the foundations of a new dynasty at a new location and with
a new base of power.
Unlike the founders of the Tran dynasty, who had time in which to establish
their rule before being tested by the Mongols, Le Quy Ly had to deal with Ming
expansionism before he had gained the loyalty of the people in his kingdom,
many of whom remained attached to remnants of the Tran dynasty. By the late
fourteenth century, the Tran aristocracy had become an accumulation of autono-
mous private estates that had to be destroyed before an effective central

government could be rebuilt. Le Quy Ly did not shrink from the task. He
understood the Ming threat and hastened to prepare for it.
After the death of Tran Phu in1394, Le Quy Ly tightened his grip on the Tran
court. He wrote a book of instructions for the16-year-old king, Tran Ngung,
who showed no aptitude for government and was easily isolated from court
affairs. Le Quy Ly moved into a palace beside the central court where his close
associates were given the highest positions. Officials were prohibited from wear-
ing robes at court with large sleeves in which objects, such as weapons, could be
concealed, and anyone heard conversing about people previously killed for
conspiring against Le Quy Ly were put to death.
Before directly challenging the Tran royal family, Le Quy Ly moved to gain
control of the four other major groups with influence in the kingdom: monks,
merchants, scholars, and soldiers. In1396, he attended to all of these groups.
Monks younger than50 years old were defrocked and returned to secular life,
and an examination for knowledge of Buddhist sutras was given as the basis for
appointing people to govern temples, shrines, and monasteries.
As for those who accumulated wealth by commerce, Le Quy Ly attempted to
cut down their power by prohibiting the use or possession of coins, which until
then were the only form of money. All coins had to be exchanged for paper
money. This measure was intended to force the wealth of merchants out into the
open, to make it difficult for them to avoid paying market taxes, and to make
their assets vulnerable to government inspection.
Scholars were given a new curriculum for the civil service examinations. Le
Quy Ly issued an edition of the classical texts in vernacular Nom characters. This
edition no longer exists, but, according to annalists, he wrote an introduction
that presented“his own ideas” rather than following the orthodoxy of Zhu Xi.
Aware of the importance of palace women, he sent female teachers to instruct
them with this edition. The exam for scholars was prescribed to have four parts:
an essay of at least500 words on the classical texts that followed a prescribed
format for developing a philosophical theme; a poem following Tang prosodic
rules and an essay of at least500 words in rhyming prose (phu, which had
become popular in the fourteenth century and was often written in the vernacu-
lar); examples of proclamations, remonstrations, and petitions in prescribed
styles; and a1,000-word essay based on the classics, histories, and current
affairs. The first exam under this new regime was held in1400. Until then,
education officials and aspiring scholars were fully absorbed in preparing for it.
To keep soldiers busy, military leaders were aimed at Champa. An expedition
into Champa in1396 resulted in the capture of a Cham general, who was given a
military command and who faithfully served Le Quy Ly thereafter. In the
following year, another Cham general along with his family and entourage

submitted. He was assigned to guard the southern border. These men owed their
allegiance to Le Quy Ly and not to the Tran dynasty.
With the ranks of monks limited to the elderly and erudite, the monetary assets
of merchants inventoried and shifted from metal to paper, the scholars busy
studying for exams, and generals occupied with the Cham borderlands, Le Quy
Ly was ready to confront the Tran nobles. Thang Long was a Tran city. Le Quy
Ly decided to move the capital to his home district of Vinh Loc in Thanh Hoa
Province, thereby removing the seat of government from the Red River plain
where loyalty to the Tran was strong. The new capital was115 kilometers south
of Thang Long over mountainous terrain; it was170 kilometers by boat down-
river from Thang Long to the seacoast then up the Ma River.
In 1397, within a few months, a wall of about850 meters square was built
nestled among the foothills on the north bank of the Ma River. Palaces were
hastily constructed within. Near the end of the year, the19-year-old king was
taken to the new capital; officials who attempted to warn him that shifting to the
new capital was part of Le Quy Ly’s plan to seize the throne were killed. Thang
Long palaces were dismantled for transport to the new capital, which became
known as Tay Do (western capital). Thang Long was known by different names
over the next few years but in the second quarter of the fifteenth century became
known as Dong Kinh (eastern capital), from which derives the modern term
Tonkin.
In 1398, Tran Ngung, the king, was persuaded to yield the throne to his
2-year-old son, Tran An, a grandson of Le Quy Ly. A year later, Tran Ngung
was sent to a Daoist temple near modern Dong Trieu in Quang Ninh Province,
where he was killed on Le Quy Ly’s orders. A conspiracy among Tran nobles
against Le Quy Ly was uncovered at the annual blood oath ceremony, held at
Tay Do in1399. Le Quy Ly took the opportunity to kill over370 people and to
imprison hundreds more. This dealt the Tran royal clan a mortal blow. Le Quy
Ly imposed tight security measures throughout the kingdom; travel permits were
required to be outside of one’s home district and villagers were afraid to give
hospitality to strangers. A rope was stretched across the Ma River downriver
from Tay Do, forcing boats to stop for inspection. Prisoners were set to work
digging canals in the southern provinces or were scattered among colonies in the
mountains.
Resistance nevertheless emerged under leadership from an unexpected source.
Someone identified as a counterfeiter gathered an army of rebels, reportedly ten
thousand strong, in the northwest of the Red River plain. Le Quy Ly managed to
suppress this uprising after six months of fighting.
As he shifted his government to Tay Do, eliminated the potentially obstreper-
ous young king, and subdued the royal family by killing and imprisoning

hundreds of nobles and their followers, Le Quy Ly also enforced limits on land
ownership that were aimed at the Tran aristocracy, families allied with the Tran,
and ambitious commoners, all of whose power rested upon large private estates
worked by peasants in a slave or serf-like status. Except for the very highest
princes and princesses, land ownership was to be limited to ten hectares. Le Quy
Ly particularly targeted land that in recent generations had been reclaimed from
the sea in modern Thai Binh and Nam Dinh Provinces, which is where many of
the largest private estates existed. All landowners had to declare the size of their
holdings, with excess land passing to the state. Strict rules were laid down for
establishing claims of ownership, and those convicted of crimes had their land
confiscated.
At the same time as these measures were being put into effect, a new system of
provincial government was instituted with differently organized jurisdictions and
new names. Provincial officials were required to make annual reports about men
available for military conscription, tax revenues in rice and in money, and
judicial proceedings. Public land was set aside to support schools, and teachers
were to annually send their best students to the capital for further study or for
appointments in the government.
In 1400, Le Quy Ly took the throne and restored to his family the surname
Ho. He named his kingdom Dai Ngu, “Great Ngu” (Chinese Yu), thereby
claiming kinship with the ancient sage-king Shun, also called Yu Shun (Vietnam-
ese Ngu Thuan), a descendent of whom had later received from the founder of
the Zhou dynasty (around1000 bce) a ducal appointment with which he
acquired the surname Hu (Vietnamese Ho), from whom Ho Quy Ly now claimed
descent. This did not signify an effort to be associated with the imperial history of
northern empires, for Vietnamese considered their inheritance of classical
antiquity to be as authentic as that of the northerners. The invocation of Shun
as Ho Quy Ly’s ancestor evoked the principle of succession based not on blood
but on merit, for Shun was related neither to his predecessor, who chose him, nor
to his successor, whom he chose. Ho Quy Ly aimed to portray the change of
dynasty from Tran to Ho as following a pattern for which the sage-kings of
antiquity were praised.
Ho Quy Ly demoted his small grandson Tran An from the throne, then raised
his second son, Ho Han Thuong, to be king, himself becoming senior king. He
passed over his eldest son Ho Nguyen Truong because his mother was not a Tran
woman. Ho Han Thuong’s mother was a daughter of Tran Manh, so, when
Ming envoys began to invoke the legitimacy of the Tran dynasty, Ho Han
Thuong could be presented as Tran Manh’s grandson. Ho Han Thuong seems
not to have had any particular ability. On the other hand, Ho Nguyen Trung
ably served his father in making plans and leading soldiers.

Ho Quy Ly
During the few years of his rule, Ho Quy Ly presided over a blizzard of activity
aimed at monitoring and suppressing dissent, mobilizing available resources to
push back the Chams, and preparing for an impending Ming attack. His efforts
to control officialdom, private property, the marketplace, manpower, and edu-
cation were steadily expanded. He sent out trusted officers to check on provincial
and local officials. Based on their reports, officials were promoted or demoted.
An important criterion in these investigations was an individual’s sense of loyalty
to the new dynastic regime. At the same time, new regulations for administering
law and conducting local government were published.
A census in1401 was more thorough than previous enumerations had been
and discovered a great increase in the number of men available for conscription
as soldiers. The ownership of slaves was restricted, with excess slaves being
appropriated by the state; this provision was applied even to remaining Tran
nobles, whose landholdings were also restricted at this time. Taxes on land were
dramatically increased and were to be paid in paper money. Market inspectors
were sent to enforce uniform weights and measures and to ensure the use of
paper money, which was resisted by merchants. New taxes were levied on boats
that carried merchandise. Ho Quy Ly was gathering manpower, land, and metal
coins from people who could potentially oppose him.
The degree of disaffection toward Ho Quy Ly was so significant that in these
years there was a large turnover in officials, as many resigned or retired or were
dismissed. The prevailing system of examinations to select men for officialdom
was inadequate to meet the need for new officials. In1400, an examination was
held under the existing scheme and twenty men were graduated. In1404 a new
plan to mobilize more students into the examinations was published, but it was
not implemented because of the urgent preparations for war with Ming that
began to absorb Ho Quy Ly’s attention. Consequently, in 1405 an ad hoc
examination was held that selected170 people for government appointments.
At the same time an even more informal examination produced appointments for
an unrecorded number of officials.
The rapid turnover of officials in these years prevented implementation of a
plan to establish a system of granaries to provide food in times of want. Instead,
when a famine broke out in1405, inspectors were sent to inventory the rice
supplies of wealthy families and to force them to sell rice to the hungry. At that
time, the brewing of rice wine was prohibited to save rice for eating.
One ritual change indicated a shift from loyalty enforced by religious belief to
loyalty enforced by a police system. The annual blood oath, which appealed to

one’s fear of spirits and deities and had been practiced since1028, was aban-
doned. In its place was a cadre of spies and special police who monitored any
detectable sign of disloyalty. Ho Quy Ly, rather than supernatural powers, now
commanded fear and respect. In place of the oath ceremony, Ho Quy Ly
instituted an annual sacrifice to Heaven on behalf of the kingdom to pray for
good harvests and prosperity. This sacrifice was calledgiao (Chinese jiao),
indicating a tradition of Daoist sacrifices that developed in China during preced-
ing centuries to supersede what were considered to be old-fashioned sacrifices to
unorthodox and demonic spirits.
Another ritual change was abandonment of the birthday festival that had been
held upon the accession of kings since the time of Le Hoan during the Hoa Lu
monarchy. Instead, in1405, Ho Quy Ly celebrated his seventieth birthday by
holding a grand reception at Tay Do and by distributing gifts to people in the
kingdom who were the same age as he or older. He reformed the traditional royal
birthday festival from a legitimizing formality to an act of venerating longevity,
bringing to mind the sage-kings of ancient times.
Many people in the Red River plain viewed Ho Quy Ly with sullen disenchant-
ment, being aggravated by his hard policies and nursing nostalgia for what they
imagined to have been a better time under the Tran kings. Facing south, however,
Ho Quy Ly found people who were ready to respond to his leadership, and there
he achieved a brief but significant expansion of his regime. Considering that for
the first twenty years of his public career he was almost exclusively occupied with
desperate efforts to fight off Cham attacks, it is no surprise that after taking the
throne his first order of business was to settle accounts with the Chams. An initial
expedition against the Chams in1401 was unsuccessful, but in the following year,
after building a road with post houses from Tay Do to the border near modern
Hue, Ho Quy Ly forced the Cham king to cede to him what are now the provinces
of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. Some of the people there followed the Cham king
in his withdrawal from those territories, but many Chams remained and were
organized into militia units with Vietnamese officers. There are families in Quang
Nam Province today whose genealogical records indicate that they were originally
Cham and that they took Vietnamese surnames in the time of Ho Quy Ly. Officials
were appointed to govern these new border provinces. Landless people were
settled there and water buffaloes were sent to assist in developing agriculture. In
1404, in a time of food scarcity, rice was sent to these provinces.
In 1403, Ho Quy Ly, determined to utterly destroy the Cham threat, sent
another expedition into Champa and besieged the Cham capital at Vijaya in
modern Binh Dinh Province. However, he was forced to lift the siege and
withdraw when supplies ran out. Thereafter, his attention was turned to the
north where a much more serious threat was materializing.

During the reign of the founder of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang (r.1368–
1398), a disturbing pattern of peremptory demands had developed. In1384, Ming
demanded provisions for its soldiers fighting in Yunnan. In1385, Ming demanded
elephants and transportation facilities for moving soldiers south to fight Champa.
In the same year there was a demand for tropical fruits and for Buddhist monks.
In1395 came demands for monks, masseuses, and eunuchs. In each case, the
demands were at least partially met or plausible excuses were made. One of the
eunuchs sent in1395 arrived at Tay Do with a Ming envoy in1403. Accused of
serving as a Ming spy, Ho Quy Ly ordered him seized and killed.
By this time, Emperor Zhu Di (r.1402–1424) was on the Ming throne and
pursued an expansionary policy. Zhu Yuanzhang, his father, appears to have
viewed Thang Long as a vassal that had acquired bad habits during the Mongol–
Yuan dynasty and needed to relearn proper imperial discipline. He took a dim view
of the fighting between the Vietnamese and the Chams and tended to put most of the
blame on the Vietnamese because they should know better than to behave like
disorderly uncivilized people. On the other hand, Zhu Di viewed Ho Quy Ly both as
an obstacle to the“great peace” of his imperial order and as an opportunity, because
Tran dynasty partisans persuaded him that Ho Quy Ly did not have the support of
the people and could be easily removed. Zhu Di was uncharacteristically outward
looking among the Ming emperors. He allocated resources to build and outfit the
fleets of Admiral Zheng He, which during his reign made several voyages through
Southeast Asia to South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa. Filledwith the
exuberance of reasserting imperial power on the scale of the Han and Tang dynas-
ties, Zhu Di was tempted to bring Giao Chi/An Nam back under direct rule.
By 1403, Ming envoys were, in the words of annalists, coming and going
between Zhu Di’s capital at Nanjing and Tay Do“like the shuttle of a loom,”
and tension between the two newly established regimes increased rapidly. Diplo-
matic exchanges became difficult and unpleasant. In1404, a Ming envoy appeared
suddenly, delivered an accusatory message, and headed back to the northern
border as unexpectedly as he had come. Ho Quy Ly sent men to kill him, but he
escaped across the border before they could catch up with him. In1405,Z h uD i
demanded cession of certain border territories. Ho Quy Ly, seeking to buy time,
agreed to deliver some land, but relations did not improve, and later that yearZhu
Di imprisoned one of Ho Quy Ly’s envoys sent to negotiate an accommodation. It
was becoming obvious that Zhu Di was intent upon striking at Ho Quy Ly.
From 1404, Ho Quy Ly prepared for war with Ming. Landless, unemployed,
and indigent men were organized into special army units. Boats were constantly
on patrol at the border to intercept spies and watch for signs of an imminent
attack. Wooden stakes were planted at strategic points in the rivers to obstruct
invading boats, both from the sea and from Yunnan down the Red River. People

with skills to make weapons were gathered at newly established arsenals. The
army was reorganized and Ho Quy Ly traveled through the kingdom to inspect
the terrain and make plans for defense. He ignored the advice of one general to
engage invaders in the mountainous terrain on the borders and instead prepared
a riverbank defense in the heart of the Red River plain. The key to his plan was
the Da Bang fortress built on the southern bank of the Red River northwest of
Dong Kinh, at the point where Ming armies from Yunnan and from Guangxi
would most likely attempt to join forces.
An anecdote about the construction of Da Bang fortress is emblematic of Ho
Quy Ly’s subsequent reputation. When, in the course of construction, the shrine of
a local spirit was destroyed, the spirit reportedly appeared in a dream to the official
in charge and requested that the shrine be rebuilt. In reply the official wrote apoem
with the words:“It is too bad, but there comes a time when old trees must suffer
axes.” Later historians commented that when“knowledgeable people” heard
about this poem they knew that Ho Quy Ly would come to a bad end. This idea
that Ho Quy Ly and his followers were the victims of their arrogant disregard for
tradition was useful to later historians as an explanation for Ho Quy Ly’sf a i l u r e ,
but in fact he did not have the luxury of time to plant his regime in the minds ofa
new generation before having to face a powerful foe that was determinedto
dominate the region. When he met with his generals and advisors in1405 to
discuss the situation, his eldest son Ho Nguyen Trung prophetically said:“Ia mn o t
afraid to fight. I fear only that the people will abandon us.” The people whose
loyalties were most in doubt were the inhabitants of the Red River plain. Ho Quy
Ly could not rely upon the Red River plain as the source of his military strength as
the Ly and Tran courts had been able to do when resisting invaders in previous
centuries. Instead, the Red River plain became a forward line of defense for his
base of power in the southern provinces and his seat at Tay Do.
A small Ming army came across the northern border in late spring of1406
escorting a man who claimed to be a member of the Tran royal family. The Ming
proposed to place him on the throne and to demote Ho Quy Ly to a provincial post
in the far south. Ho generals engaged the Ming as they emerged from the mountains
into the northeastern foothills of the Red River plain. After a day of bitterfighting,
Ho Quy Ly’s men captured the Tran pretender along with many Ming officers and
soldiers. The Ming commander barely escaped back to the border. This triggered
Ming plans to invade that already had been in preparation for two years.
In the few months before the end of the monsoon rain season, when the land
would be sufficiently dry to enable the movement of large armies, Ho Quy Ly
made his final arrangements for war. Stakes were planted at the river mouths, the
population in the northeastern part of the Red River plain was evacuated to the
south and west, and retired officers were called to duty. But no serious resistance

was given to the Ming armies as they came through the mountains and entered
the Red River plain.
Modern historians have estimated that an army of135,000 men set out from
Guangxi and an army of80,000 advanced from Yunnan. By the end of1407,t h e
two armies had joined forces in the northwestern part of the plain, had overrunDa
Bang fortress, and had occupied Dong Kinh. Ming officers spread the news that they
had come to restore the Tran dynasty. More than half of Ho Quy Ly’s soldiers
deserted. Prominent families in the Red River plain led by Mac Thuy and his
brothers, descendents of a famous scholar-official in the early fourteenth century
named Mac Dinh Chi (1272–1346), offered their allegiance to the Ming.
In early1407, as most of the people in the Red River plain and many members
of the Ho government defected to the Ming, Ho Quy Ly and his eldest son Ho
Nguyen Trung rallied their soldiers and led a final desperate attack up the Red
River to dislodge the Ming from Dong Kinh. They were decisively defeated and
retreated to Tay Do. Pursuing Ming forces quickly expelled them from Thanh
Hoa and chased them down the coast. Ho Quy Ly, his sons, and other family
members along with their followers were captured in what is now southern Ha
Tinh Province and taken to the Ming capital at Nanjing. Ho Quy Ly and Ho Han
Thuong were imprisoned and disappear from recorded history. Ho Nguyen
Trung found a new career as a manufacturer of weapons near the northern Ming
capital at Beijing and died after authoring a book about his native country that
was published in1438.
Pre-modern Vietnamese historians, following historiographical rules estab-
lished by the Song scholar Sima Guang (1019–1086), viewed Ho Quy Ly as an
illegitimate usurper, and he was scorned for having failed to defend the country.
In modern times, scholars have variously viewed him as a feared, even hated,
reformer; as a savior of the Vietnamese state amidst the disintegration of the
Tran dynasty; and as a ruthless yet astute man who deserves some recognition
for what he accomplished under difficult circumstances. He lived in hard times,
but rebuilt a crumbling dynastic regime with imagination and will. He was
stymied by Zhu Di’s expansionist policy, which was beyond his control.
A historic watershed
By mid1407 the Ming announced that the Tran family was extinct and, report-
edly in response to petitions from local leaders and elders, proceeded to organize
the imperial province of Giao Chi. Huang Fu, the senior civil official, immedi-
ately began to establish a structure of government staffed by both local men and
men from other imperial provinces. He spent the next decade in Giao Chi as the

senior administrator. According to the official Vietnamese history (Complete Book
of the History of Great Viet) compiled later in the century, he“was intelligent, was
able to cope with changing circumstances, had talent for government, and was
respected by the people.” His stated aim was“to make a fresh start” after the
turmoil of the preceding thirty-five years. He used the expressioncanh tan(Chinese
gengxin), “change to the new,” the literary equivalent of the vernacular termdoi
moi, generally translated as“renovation,” which has become famous as the desig-
nation of government policy in Vietnam beginning in the late1980s.
This expression has a venerable pedigree in pre-modern Vietnamese political
thought and shows a perception of discontinuity that is at least as characteristic of
historical experience as the more common assertion of continuity. Since the tenth
century, no experiment in establishing a structure of political leadership has lasted
more than a few generations, whether it was personal charisma, maternal kinship,
group solidarity, merit, or despotism. Now there would be an experiment in going
back to the empire. None of these experiments led logically from one to the next.
They each exhausted the possibilities for developing a particular solution to the
problem of leadership in the context of a specific time and place. Each experiment
turned in a new direction that did not necessarily develop from what had gone
before. These experiments were enabled, shaped, or thwarted by the vicissitudes of
powerful empires rising and declining just beyond the northern border.
Vietnamese historians have unanimously viewed the experiment in Ming rule
as a tale of woe with no redeeming features and sure to fall beneath the weight of
its own corruption and the righteous wrath of Vietnamese patriots. However,
this was not a story with a pre-ordained narrative. It was initiated and aban-
doned as a result of decisions made at the Ming court. Like the interventions of
Wang Anshi, Kubilai Khan, and Che Bong Nga, this was not a struggle with an
outcome determined by a law or theme of history but rather by the ambition and
limitation of a particular man, in this case Zhu Di. Furthermore, Ming rule had a
transforming effect on the development of Vietnamese culture and politics. For
one thing, it completed the destruction of the Tran aristocracy begun by Ho Quy
Ly. For another, it inculcated a generation of students with the Confucianism of
Zhu Xi, which thereafter replaced Buddhism as the primary ideological vantage
of rulers. And it also aroused a new style of monarchy that built upon the brief
experiment of Ho Quy Ly in Thanh Hoa.
The senior Ming military commander in Giao Chi, Zhang Fu, was among the
most competent military figures of the early Ming period. After preparing and
leading the Ming invasion, he spent most of the next two decades in Giao Chi
attending to security matters. His main post-invasion task was the suppression of
resistance led by surviving members of the Tran royal family. In autumn of1407,
a son of Tran Phu named Tran Ngoi rallied soldiers to the Tran banner and

proclaimed himself king at Yen Mo district in Ninh Binh Province, near Hoa Lu.
Within two days Ming soldiers attacked him, and he fled south to Nghe An
Province. There, he and his men killed two Tran nobles along with five hundred
of their followers because they refused to abandon their allegiance to the Ming.
Within weeks, Zhang Fu attacked Tran Ngoi and forced him further south. By
mid1408, Zhang Fu had returned to Dong Kinh and Tran Ngoi had returned to
Nghe An, where he was joined by a general named Dang Tat leading soldiers
from the far southern frontier.
With Ho Quy Ly’s defeat, the Cham king had reoccupied Quang Ngai and
Quang Nam. Dang Tat and other officials from those jurisdictions began to fight
among themselves as they withdrew northward. Dang Tat prevailed over his
erstwhile colleagues and then sealed his ascendant status on the border by
pledging allegiance to Ming. He now abandoned this pledge and joined his forces
with Tran Ngoi. He rallied a large army and led it north through Thanh Hoa and
into the Red River plain. Near the end of1408 in Y Yen district, Nam Dinh
Province, on the road to Dong Kinh, he defeated a Ming force that had been sent
to stop him. This was the last hurrah of the Tran dynasty, but it was achieved
under the leadership of a headstrong and careless man. Dang Tat brushed aside
Tran Ngoi’s desire to follow up the victory with an immediate attack on Dong
Kinh and instead led his soldiers from place to place in the lower plain to disperse
Ming garrisons and rally more people to his banner. In early1409, when rumors
spread that Dang Tat was thinking of pushing Tran Ngoi aside to proclaim
himself king, Tran Ngoi had him killed.
This turn of events caused dismay among Tran partisans, and a son of Dang
Tat went south to rally support for Tran Quy Khoang, a son of Tran Phu’s son
Tran Ngac, a nephew of Tran Ngoi. Tran Quy Khoang was proclaimed king in
Nghe An. His partisans captured Tran Ngoi and brought him to Nghe An. By
autumn1409, the two kings had worked out an arrangement with Tran Ngoi
as senior king and Tran Quy Khoang as junior king. The two kings led their
forces north but were defeated in Thanh Hoa by Zhang Fu in an engagement
resulting in Tran Ngoi’s capture by the Ming. Thanh Hoa was thereafter
pacified and incorporated into Giao Chi. Tran Quy Khoang attempted to
invade Thanh Hoa in1410 but was repelled. He was thereafter inactive and
survived for two years until Zhang Fu expelled him from Nghe An, pursued
him to the southern border and captured him there in1413. The Ming had
completed the pacification of the Red River plain and Thanh Hoa by1409;
Nghe An, which included modern Ha Tinh, by1412; and the southernmost
territories down to the region of Hue by1413. Quang Nam and Quang Ngai
were left to the Chams. Irreconcilable opponents of the Ming fled to Champa
and Laos.

Later Vietnamese court annalists criticized Tran Ngoi and Tran Quy Khoang
for being weak leaders and for being addicted to wine and women. Their most
ardent followers and boldest generals came from the Cham frontier. They relied
upon residual loyalty to the Tran dynasty, but their failures and internal rivalries
accumulated, giving them no prospect for overcoming such a strong and relent-
less foe as Zhang Fu.
As long as Emperor Zhu Di remained alive, until1424, the project of making
Giao Chi a Ming province was firmly supported by the imperial court and,
despite problems, was plausibly a success or at least on the way to success.
Huang Fu was governor throughout this time, giving a continuity of leadership
that generated administrative momentum. The later propaganda of the Le dyn-
asty that developed in resistance to Ming rule portrayed Ming Giao Chi as a
cruel, oppressive, exploitative regime. In fact, like nearly every regime that has
tried to govern anywhere, Huang Fu’s administration was a mixture of positive
and negative characteristics. Overall, the positive was no less important than the
negative, depending upon the perceptions of particular localities.
People in the Red River plain tended to support Ming government. People in
the lowlands of the southern provinces of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An were
generally responsive to Ming government as well. But in the foothills and
uplands of these southern provinces was an endemic resistance to Ming rule. In
other words, following a distinction first reported during Tran times, many Kinh
people perceived value in being part of the northern empire, but the Trai people
did not. Thus, in the1420s, after the death of Zhu Di, it was among the Trai
population of the southern provinces that active resistance to Ming developed
most rapidly, particularly in the lower valleys of the foothills south of the Red
River and west of the coastal plains. The Tran terms Kinh and Trai represented
different tendencies on a spectrum of cultural and linguistic practice that in
modern times have been perceived as a difference between Vietnamese and
various peoples collectively called Muong. This difference began to assume a
significant political aspect in the fifteenth century with the building of Tay Do
and with Thanh Hoa becoming the home of kings. Ming rule exacerbated latent
tensions between the Red River plain and the southern provinces that became a
prominent feature of Vietnamese politics for the next four centuries.
Ming Giao Chi
The year of conquest,1407, brought a social and economic disaster. With
disruptions caused by military operations, there was no harvest. Famine com-
bined with an epidemic, and corpses piled up faster than they could be buried.

Huang Fu rapidly established an administration that was integrated with gov-
ernment elsewhere in the empire and conditions gradually improved. Thousands
of local men received appointments at all levels of administration. Thousands
more went to the Ming capital to be trained and evaluated for appointments both
in Giao Chi and elsewhere in the empire. At the same time, men arrived from the
north to receive appointments. They came from all parts of the north, but most of
them were from neighboring provinces and many of them were students who
failed in their examinations or were officials suffering demotion or exile. The
quality of administrative personnel was mixed and not significantly different
from comparable imperial jurisdictions on relatively remote frontiers. By1416 it
was possible for Huang Fu to integrate administrative personnel into the system
for government appointments that prevailed elsewhere in the empire. In that
same year, the procedure for setting up local police and defense forces was
finalized.
Ming educational policies left a strong legacy among the Vietnamese. The
emphasis on a Confucian education that opened the way to civil service
examinations was but part of a much larger educational effort that included
schools for the study of Buddhism, Daoism, medicine, physiognomy, and astrol-
ogy. People with knowledge in these areas were recruited to teach, and some of
them were sent to contribute their knowledge at the imperial court in Nanjing.
Many shrines to Confucius (Van Mieu) and to the God of Agriculture (Xa Tac)
were built throughout Giao Chi, but popular religion was also encouraged with
the building or repair of hundreds of shrines to local deities and nature spirits.
Confucian scholars, Buddhist monks, and Daoist priests were all regulated and
supervised. In1419, Ming sent a new edition of the classical Confucian texts to
Giao Chi, as well as erudite Buddhists to instruct the monks in Giao Chi.
Ming officials organized an up-to-date communication and transportation
system with roads, bridges, waterways, and post houses. This contributed not
only to administrative efficiency but also to trade and commerce. Ming tax policy
in Giao Chi was intentionally light to assist post-war reconstruction and to foster
good will toward the regime. In1411, rewards were distributed to local people
who had earned merit in suppressing the Tran resistance, indicating that by then
Zhang Fu considered the resistance to be under control. At the same time, a
three-year tax holiday was declared for major commodities such as gold, silver,
iron, ivory, plumage from tropical birds, aromatic wood for incense, pearls,
lacquer ware, tea, fans, fish, and salt. These were items traded to cities in the
north. Even rice was exported to the north in1413.
In 1407, immediately after the conquest, several thousand skilled craftsmen
were sent to Nanjing. In 1413, shipbuilders along with their families were
relocated to the north, apparently to assist in preparations for Zheng He’s fourth

voyage, which began that year. In contrast to those with useful skills were those
uprooted by the conquest and its attendant disorders, homeless and wandering
from place to place. This floating population was gathered and assigned to
productive work or to military service.
In 1414, at the end of the tax holiday, a schedule for taxes on rice fields and
mulberry orchards for silk production and for levies on marketable commodities
was instituted. According to theComplete Book of the History of Great Viet,
compiled by Le Dynasty historians, in1415, “Taxes were heavy, levies were
substantial, and so the people had nothing from which to make a living.” This
evaluation is excessively colored by the need to see no virtue in the regime
supplanted by the Le dynasty. But it does indicate the beginning of Giao Chi’s
integration into the imperial system of revenue collection. Corruption, a normal
and ineradicable feature of government, was particularly common in the collec-
tion of lucrative commodities. Enterprising officials found ways to make per-
sonal fortunes at the expense of those who were defenseless against their
demands. There were examples of corruption in nearly all the commodity
markets, but salt was a special case. A government monopoly on salt production
became enmeshed in the assignment of contracts to salt merchants to supply
Ming garrisons in Giao Chi, which offered unusual opportunities for unlawful
enrichment.
The most negative features of Ming Giao Chi came from the arrogance and
prejudice of Ming people toward the local population. Routine corruption easily
became malignant in a situation where northerners viewed local people as less
civilized than themselves. The underworld of corruption can be more biting and
brutal in a colonial context than it otherwise would be. Ming soldiers garrisoned
in Giao Chi dismayed some local people who felt their presence as an intrusion,
an imposition, or even as a subversion of good social relations. The conceit of a
civilizing mission animated positive features of Ming policy in Giao Chi, but it
also contributed to the negative effects of the Ming adventure among the
Vietnamese.
This was particularly obvious in the policy that sought to collect all“hetero-
dox” writings. These were writings in the vernacular, but also historical and
literary writings in the classical language that expressed the perspective of a
separate kingdom in the south or that were in any way critical of northern
dynasties. Many of these writings were destroyed on the spot and many others
were transported north. What is certain is that nearly all of them disappeared.
Consequently, writings by Vietnamese from before the fifteenth century are very
rare. Several works of history disappeared along with collections of poetry and
other writings. The only book among those taken to the north that is known to
have survived, an annal of the Ly dynasty, surfaced in a Qing anthology three

centuries later. Other than that single item, of the books collected by Ming
officials, nothing remains, although today it is possible to encounter myths about
a hidden cache of books waiting to be discovered somewhere in China that will
restore to the Vietnamese their pre-fifteenth-century literary heritage. Some
historical and literary works did escape this effort to eradicate the corpus of
“southern” writings and became the basis of later knowledge about the previous
five centuries.
In addition to changing the ideas in people’s minds and the books that were
available for educated people to read, Ming civilizers also endeavored to change
more material aspects of life. According to theComplete Book of the History of
Great Viet, they“forbade unmarried boys and girls to cut their hair and forbade
women to wear short skirts, in order to change customs in conformity with the
north.” Presumably, the lengthening of skirts promoted a female modesty valued
by proponents of Ming’s dominant Confucian ideology. Similarly, the forbidding
of children to cut their hair follows a rule of filial piety associated with Confu-
cianism that hair, being a gift from one’s parents, should not be cut. These rules
predictably targeted women and children, the most vulnerable people in any
society.
Huang Fu and the best of Ming administrators in Giao Chi espoused an
idealistic desire to provide good government and to foster prosperity and happi-
ness among the people. On the other hand, the underworld of corruption and the
arrogance of northerners who considered themselves superior were more imme-
diate to many local people than were those good intentions. Nevertheless, there is
no evidence from which to judge Ming Giao Chi as significantly more corrupt
than the indigenous regimes that ruled the Vietnamese both before and after the
Ming episode. Resistance to the Ming regime would presumably have faded
away with the passing of generations, but this would have required a longer
Ming commitment than the lifetime of a single emperor.
The abandonment of Ming Giao Chi
After1424, Zhu Di’s successors abandoned the Giao Chi project because they
deemed its cost to be greater than its benefit. Despite the accumulation of private
fortunes by some Ming officials in Giao Chi, government there was a net loss for
the state treasury. This problem may have abated if Zhu Di’s successors had been
as committed as he was to completing the task of governing the Vietnamese. As
soon as he was gone, however, Ming Giao Chi rapidly collapsed.
One result of Ming rule is that for two decades Chinese was again the prestige
language and most educated people learned to speak Chinese. This resulted in

certain words and pronunciations of words that were particular to Ming entering
the Vietnamese lexicon. For example, a seventeenth-century dictionary indicates
that some words had both pre-Ming and Ming pronunciations. The dictionary
registered a preference for the pre-Ming pronunciations over the Ming pronunci-
ations, which were not considered as authoritative as more venerable usages.
Another feature of the linguistic dimension of Ming rule was to hasten, if not
provoke, a phonological trend to abandon sesquisyllabic words, which had an
initial“half syllable,” in favor of true monosyllabic forms.
In 1416, Zhang Fu yielded military matters to Li Bin, a competent commander
who had participated in the initial conquest in1407. The security situation was
basically stable, but the potential for rebellion, particularly among people in
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, lay beneath a surface calm and it required constant
vigilance. When uprisings broke into the open, Li Bin was able to suppress or to
contain them with relative ease. Nevertheless, there were large numbers of people
living in the shadow of the law, particularly in the foothills, who readily rallied
behind plausible rebel leaders, and there were local men serving in Ming govern-
ment who could not always be trusted.
In 1419, a local officer in Nghe An, angry about the extortions of a Ming
official, rebelled and besieged the provincial citadel. Li Bin led reinforcements
that quickly raised the siege and dispersed the rebels across the Laotian frontier.
Meanwhile, a group of six men in localities surrounding Dong Kinh, noting that
the best soldiers had left with Li Bin for Nghe An and that only a small force
remained in the city, united their followers to attack the capital. Li Bin returned
and easily defeated them.
One of Li Bin’s officers, a man named Lo Van Luat from Thach That district
just west of Dong Kinh, had disappeared into the mountains during the Nghe An
campaign. He reappeared in1420 leading a rebel army in Thach That. Li Bin
quickly defeated him. He fled to Laos as Li Bin destroyed the villages of his
followers and pursued them into the nearby mountains where they took refuge in
caves. Li Bin built fires at the mouths of the caves and filled them with smoke,
killing the people inside.
The most famous event of1420 was the uprising of Le Nga, a former slave
who was reportedly handsome and charismatic and who, seeing how aspiring
rebel leaders were fighting among themselves in the mountains northeast of the
Red River plain, rallied large numbers of their followers by saying:“If you want
to be rich, follow me!” He proclaimed himself king in the mountains of Lang Son
Province and marched down to seize Xuong Giang (modern Bac Giang). His
former master recognized him and attacked him but was defeated. Li Bin then
arrived and sent Le Nga and his followers fleeing into the mountains. News of Le
Nga having captured a major town, however, had reached the imperial court and

Zhu Di angrily demanded that he be captured and transported to the Ming
capital. Unable to lay his hands on Le Nga, Li Bin seized an innocent man and
sent him instead, claiming that he was Le Nga. This caused a stir among local
people against this injustice, which required Huang Fu’s intervention.
During these years, a local strongman in the foothills of Thanh Hoa named Le
Loi was a minor nuisance. He was from the region of Mount Lam, around
twenty kilometers southwest of Tay Do, where Kinh and Trai peoples mingled.
Born in1385, he became the head of a prominent family that gained control of a
parcel of land during the years of Tran dynastic decline. After the Ming conquest,
he became a follower of Tran Quy Khoang. In1413, after Tran Quy Khoang’s
defeat, he swore allegiance to Ming. He then became involved in a feud with a
neighboring strongman who denounced him as a rebel to the Ming. Attacked by
the Ming, he fled into the mountains.
Early in1418 he mobilized an army and openly challenged Ming authority. He
successfully ambushed a Ming column on the upper Chu River but was then
betrayed by a turncoat who showed Ming units a way to attack him by surprise
from the rear. His followers scattered and he briefly went into hiding before
collecting enough men to ambush a Ming patrol and force it to withdraw. In
1419, he seized an outpost near Mount Lam held by another local strongman,
apparently the man with whom he was in feud, and he reportedly beheaded300
men captured there. He then spent more than a year marching around in the
uplands recruiting more men. In late1420 he ambushed a Ming patrol. Li Bin
responded by mobilizing Ming and local military forces against him, but Le Loi
achieved a victory over them in the region of Quan Hoa district on the upper Ma
River.
In late1421, a large Ming army ascended the Ma River valley to attack Le Loi.
A Laotian army approached down the valley from the opposite direction. Le Loi
was under the illusion that the Laotians were his allies. However, Lo Van Luat,
who had fled to Laos after being defeated by Li Bin the previous year, viewed Le
Loi as a rival, and he persuaded the Laotians to join the Ming in attacking Le Loi.
After a year of fighting, the Ming and Laotians gained the upper hand. By the end
of1422, Le Loi was utterly defeated and sued for peace. In1423, he returned to
Mount Lam, paid an indemnity with unspecified amounts of gold and silver, and
promised the Ming that he would live in peace. In return, the Ming provided him
with fish, salt, rice, and farm implements. This was the situation when news
arrived in1424 of the emperor’s death.
Within a month of taking the throne, Zhu Gaozhi (r.1424–1425), Zhu Di’s
son and successor, issued a proclamation indicating a dramatic change of policy
in Giao Chi; calling for“reform,” he abolished the collection of commodities. In
other initiatives, he moved to end Zheng He’s voyages, and he downgraded the

role of the military. He wanted to consolidate the core of what had been achieved
by his father and grandfather but had no taste for costly adventures. He recalled
Huang Fu from Giao Chi and lowered the priority of holding that distant place.
After only one year as emperor, Zhu Gaozhi died suddenly of a heart attack, but
his son and successor, Zhu Zhanji (r.1425–1435), continued his policies. Zhu
Zhanji considered affairs in Giao Chi an unnecessary distraction from more
serious threats on the northern frontier. In1425, he expressed the opinion that
it would be better to restore the Tran dynasty and return to the old tributary
relationship. When in1426 Zhang Fu requested permission to reassume com-
mand of Giao Chi to deal with the worsening situation there, the emperor
refused.
In 1426, Zhu Zhanji proclaimed a general amnesty and abolished all taxes
in Giao Chi except for land taxes to be paid in rice, needed to supply Ming
garrisons. The abandonment of commodity collections and taxes was the
beginning of an administrative withdrawal from Giao Chi that represented a
more realistic appraisal of the long-term interests of the Ming dynasty. Zhu
Di’s exuberant expansionism exceeded what the Ming empire was capable of
sustaining given its governing structure. The relatively high degree of bureau-
cratization and the pacifist tendencies of Confucian scholar-officials made the
Ming more like the lesser empire of Song than the greater empires of Han and
Tang.
Considering the degree to which Ming government had been established in
Giao Chi, the promises made to local people, the commitments made by local
leaders, the interests that had become attached to the imperial project, and
especially the fact that tens of thousands of Ming soldiers and officials were still
stationed there, Zhu Di’s successors could not terminate imperial policy in Giao
Chi simply with the strokes of a writing brush. The emperor had severely
diminished the priority of holding Giao Chi, but he had no plan for implement-
ing the logical conclusion of having done so. Instead, the shift in Ming policy
offered an opportunity for Ming enemies in Giao Chi, and it was they who drove
events to a final conclusion. Ming officers went on the defensive amidst a lack of
imperial interest in their plight and minimal pro forma responses by officials in
neighboring jurisdictions.
Le Loi
In late1424, news of the new emperor’s proclamation and of Huang Fu’s recall
prompted Le Loi to set out on a new trajectory. His earlier five-year career as a
rebel leader in the Thanh Hoa uplands had ended with him back at where he had

begun. During that time he had simply endeavored to survive in the mountains of
Thanh Hoa, laying ambushes and avoiding encirclement. Now he went on the
offensive, striking south through the mountains into Nghe An. After ambushing
a Ming force in Quy Chau district, he advanced to Con Cuong district on the
upper Ca River. From there he moved downriver, defeating Ming and local pro-
Ming armies until by the end of the year he had forced his enemies to take refuge
at modern Vinh, which at that time was the provincial headquarters for Nghe
An. He rallied thousands of new recruits into his armies from the upland
population of the Ca River basin.
In 1425, as the Ming court was preoccupied with the death of one emperor
and the accession of another, Le Loi sent armies both to the south and to the
north. In the south, his men defeated a Ming army in modern Quang Binh and
then marched through modern Quang Tri and Thua Thien to gain control of the
southern border. In the north, Le Loi’s men captured a Ming supply fleet in
northern Nghe An, then pursued Ming forces through Thanh Hoa to besiege
them at Tay Do. Gaining momentum from these spectacular successes, in1426
Le Loi sent his armies through the mountains north of Tay Do to emerge at the
head of the Red River plain, threatening Dong Kinh and cutting it off from the
road to Yunnan. When Ming soldiers were recalled from Vinh to reinforce Dong
Kinh, Le Loi, leaving some troops to besiege Vinh, followed the Ming forces as
they moved north, rallying thousands of men from Thanh Hoa as he went.
Pushing into the Red River plain he proclaimed as king a certain Tran Cao,
supposedly a Tran prince. Men from the Red River plain began to join his ranks
as he called for those who had favored the Ming to come to his side and arrested
those who did not. Wang Tong, at Dong Kinh as Huang Fu’s replacement, was
prepared to surrender, but local men who were loyal to Ming persuaded him to
resist. They frightened him with the story of Omar whom the Tran had drowned
in1289 while pretending to let him return north. Consequently, there followed a
year of waiting for Ming reinforcements.
Le Loi was later recorded as saying that at first he had no intention of
overthrowing the Ming regime or of becoming king: he had simply been trying
to stay alive and one event had led to another. This seeming diffidence may have
been true in the years1418–1423 when personal enemies aroused Ming and
Laotian armies against him in the Thanh Hoa uplands. However, upon news of
the death of Zhu Di, he embarked on a three-year campaign that showed
forethought and a bold, aggressive spirit. Attacking Ming and allied forces at
their most isolated and vulnerable points, he quickly gained control of the
southern provinces and recruited into his armies large numbers of men from
both the uplands and the lowlands. Without pause he had rushed his men into
the Red River plain and swiftly placed his enemies under siege.

By the beginning of1427, five major strongholds were under siege. These were
Dong Kinh and Tay Do; Co Long, a fortress built to guard the southern entrance
to the Red River plain in Y Yen district, near Vu Ban in Nam Dinh Province, on
the road between Dong Kinh and Tay Do; a fortress at Chi Linh, near Pha Lai,
that guarded the eastern part of the Red River plain; and Xuong Giang, a fortress
at the modern city of Bac Giang that guarded the route out of the Red River plain
to the northern border. All the Ming garrisons south of Tay Do had surrendered.
Le Loi established his headquarters at Bo De, in Gia Lam district, directly across
the Red River from Dong Kinh.
Le Loi understood that Ming Giao Chi was at its end. The Ming were unlikely to
make any serious effort to reassert their control in Giao Chi. By making Tran Cao
king, Le Loi satisfied the aim of restoring the Tran that had ostensibly led to the
initial Ming intervention and that Zhu Zhanji now considered to be the basis for
terminating intervention. Nevertheless, with imperial forces under siege, Ming
could not be idle. Maintaining the appearance of empire required efforts to reinforce
or to rescue the besieged remnants of Giao Chi. At a more prosaic level, the routine
habits of Ming military officials produced soldiers in response to Wang Tong’sc a l l
from Dong Kinh for help, although they would be relatively few and withoutthe
quality of leadership that had been demonstrated in the past by Zhang Fu. While
waiting for this final crack of Ming’s whip, Le Loi pressed the siege of remaining
Ming fortresses, prepared to defend the borders, and began to act like a king.
Le Loi appointed Nguyen Trai to have responsibility for organizing civil
administration and for writing letters to solicit the submission of Ming officials
and of local people serving the Ming. Nguyen Trai was a grandson of Tran
Nguyen Dan, one of the last prominent Tran princes. Nguyen Trai’s father,
Nguyen Phi Khanh, was a scholar who had served Ho Quy Ly and had been
taken as a prisoner to the north after the Ming conquest. Nguyen Phi Khanh has
left many poems expressing his aspirations for public service. Nguyen Trai had
received an excellent classical education and was a graduate of the examination
held in1400 under Ho Quy Ly. After the Ming conquest, he remained in Giao
Chi and apparently lived for several years in hiding to avoid serving the Ming.
Eventually, he joined Le Loi and served him as an advisor.
Nguyen Trai’s surviving works include several letters to Ming officials and to
local men serving the Ming explaining why they should surrender, a famous
proclamation of victory over the Ming, a history of Le Loi’s career, a geography,
and many poems both in Literary Chinese and in vernacular Vietnamese. Conse-
quently, he has become a towering figure in Vietnamese literary history, particu-
larly since very little has survived from before his lifetime and because he is the
first poet to leave a significant corpus of verse in the vernacular language.
Consequently, although largely based on conjecture, it has been widely assumed

that he was a great statesman and military strategist who devised the plans that
resulted in Le Loi’s success.
There is no firm record of when Nguyen Trai joined Le Loi, although there is a
well-known tale about him traveling to Thanh Hoa to meet Le Loi at Mount Lam
and then deciding to join him. It is very unlikely that this occurred before Le Loi
began to resist the Ming in1418, because at that time Le Loi had no particular
reputation that could possibly have drawn Nguyen Trai’s attention. It is most
likely to have been after the five years of fighting in the mountains of Thanh Hoa
that ended in Le Loi’s defeat and submission to Ming. Le Loi’s reputation as a
fighter and a survivor was established by then, and during the truce of1423–1424
it would have been possible for visitors to find Le Loi at home.
Part of the significance of Nguyen Trai’s role in the events of that time comes
from the fact that he was a man of the Kinh people in the Red River plain while
Le Loi and large numbers of his followers came from the Trai peoples of the
southern provinces. A century later, the differences between these two popula-
tions and regions would lead to prolonged civil war. The image of Le Loi and
Nguyen Trai as a team of brawn and brain representing the two parts of the
country was a useful and comforting symbol of unity, particularly since so many
Kinh people in the Red River plain had supported the Ming. In fact, there is no
firm evidence that Nguyen Trai’s contribution to Le Loi’s regime was more than
as an erudite writer of letters and proclamations, a knowledgeable administrator,
an expert on court music and ritual, and a voice of moderation amidst Le Loi’s
bloodthirsty lieutenants, all of which, while a bit short of the myth, was still a
substantial role in the tumult of that time.
The most plausible way to conjecture an even larger role for Nguyen Trai is to
associate him with the shift in aim, strategy, and tactics that we have noted
between Le Loi’s activities before and after the death of Zhu Di. From a defensive
mentality and merely staying alive in the mountains of Thanh Hoa, Le Loi
suddenly acted to mobilize the upland population of the southern provinces, to
strike at the most vulnerable points of the Ming defense, to build on the
momentum of his successes without delay, and to methodically lay the founda-
tion for a new dynastic regime. This dramatic change may have come from Le
Loi’s own meditations or from consultations with his trusted battle leaders, but it
may also owe something to Nguyen Trai, who possessed a large knowledge of
history, had closely observed Ming administration while evading it, and held
strong opinions about good government. Nguyen Trai is likely to have been more
alert than others to understanding the implications of Zhu Di’s death and of Zhu
Gaozhi’s proclamation of a new policy in Giao Chi. It may even have been these
events that prompted him to join Le Loi and to urge Le Loi to take advantage of
the changing circumstances.

A new dynastic structure
In early1427, aside from collecting rice to feed soldiers, the chief aims of Le Loi’s
civil administration in the Red River plain were focused upon accumulating know-
ledge of the population, finding qualified officials, and establishing rules for their
behavior. Family registers were compiled. Displaced people were sent back to their
villages to grow rice or to engage in trade. In a proclamation, Le Loi called upon
educated “men of ability” to come forward to serve. In one of his first acts after
establishing his headquarters at Bo De, Le Loi authorized a literary examination
that selected over thirty scholars who became the core of a civil court.
Officials who had served Ming but readily turned to serve Le Loi were
assigned to posts in the southern provinces. Checkpoints were established to
authenticate the travel documents of officials, who were admonished to strictly
follow their itinerary and instructions, to report everything that they saw and
did, and to observe“the three proscriptions”: do not be without human feeling;
do not be oppressive and rude; do not be crafty and avaricious.
As more local people who had served the Ming began to come over, proced-
ures for evaluating degrees of guilt by association were devised and levels of
punishment were prescribed. A schedule of ransoms by which guilty men could
redeem their wives, children, and slaves was published. Chieftains in the moun-
tains also began to submit, and trade in salt and fish was forbidden with those
who did not. Envoys from Champa and Laos arrived to make peace with Le Loi,
showing that the shifting tide of power was felt beyond the frontiers.
During the first half of1427, Le Loi was preoccupied with turning a rabble into
an army. Thousands of men were hastily recruited during his march through the
southern provinces. Thousands more were recruited in the Red River plain. After a
spate of fighting around Dong Kinh early in the year, Le Loi not only rewarded some
officers but he also had others executed for failure to follow instructions. He issued a
proclamation to his soldiers urging discipline and obedience. He informed them that
if they obeyed his commands he would take care of them and their families but
disobedience would be punished with death. He also announced that when thewar
ended two-thirds of them would be allowed to return to their homes and fields.
Le Loi announced ten prohibitions that give an indication of what he meant by
indiscipline in the ranks: boisterous behavior; talk of omens that caused loss of
fighting spirit; pretending not to see the flags or hear the drums ordering an
attack; not stopping when the signal to stand fast is given; not retreating when
the gong for retreat is sounded; sleeping or abandoning one’s post when on
guard duty; getting involved with women; hiding unreported wealth or taking
bribes from deserters; venting anger and hatred that obscures the merit or the

crimes of others; being dishonest, thievish, cruel, or at odds with others. Viola-
tions of these prohibitions were to be punished by beheading. Shortly after,
another punishment was announced: all members of units that flee battle and
leave some of their members behind were to be executed.
Meanwhile, catapults and siege engines were being constructed and iron forges
were built to produce and repair weapons. Dikes and walls were piled up to
tighten the siege of Dong Kinh. The northern border was put under the command
of Le Sat, one of Le Loi’s most able commanders. In late summer, a small Ming
army attempted to cross the border but was repulsed. Thereafter the families of
soldiers on the northern border were relocated out of danger and the siege of
Xuong Giang (Bac Giang) was pressed to eliminate this stepping-stone for any
Ming army on its way to relieve Dong Kinh or for any retreat of Ming forces
from Dong Kinh to the border.
The Ming commanders at Xuong Giang understood the importance of their post
and resisted to the death. Le Loi sent troops to throw up earthworks from which to
gain access to the fortress. Élite units with long swords, crossbows, flaming arrows,
and firearms joined the battle, and Xuong Giang fell ten days before the arrival of
the main Ming relief army. Le Loi instructed his generals to prepare what might be
called a“deep dead end” for the Ming army on the road from the border to Xuong
Giang with Xuong Giang as the end of the road and with units closing in around the
Ming force as it advanced. The commander of the Ming relief force did not know
that Xuong Giang had fallen so plunged ahead until he was well caught in the trap.
The Ming army was utterly annihilated.
Banners, standards, and prisoners from this campaign were conveyed to the
Ming army marching downriver from Yunnan, which persuaded its commander
to turn back, and to Wang Tong at Dong Kinh, which persuaded him to
surrender. Le Loi’s generals wanted to attack and kill remaining Ming forces,
but Nguyen Trai argued that nothing was to be gained by this and that they
should be allowed to return north without further injury. Le Loi took Nguyen
Trai’s advice and arranged for the Ming and their supporters to leave the country
in peace.
Le Loi promulgated six rules to be observed by his military officers to curb
their enthusiasm in victory, prohibiting cruelty, bullying, and criminal behavior.
Most local people who had supported the Ming decided to remain and face the
consequences of that. The rest were allowed to depart north with what remained
of the imperial garrison. Within weeks, the Ming court recognized Tran Cao as
king and abolished Giao Chi. Only a few weeks after that, Tran Cao was dead,
probably poisoned, though many stories have been told of his demise.
In 1428, Le Loi presided over an extended session of conferring rewards and
meting out punishments before entering Dong Kinh and taking the throne.

During the five years of his reign, he and his followers attended to all aspects of a
royal court: law, administration, personnel, public morality, finance, defense,
diplomacy, ritual, and succession. The role of Nguyen Trai and other civil
officials was mainly concerned with ritual, diplomacy, and the details of law
and administration. The most influential voices at court belonged to a group of
generals from Thanh Hoa who had served Le Loi from the beginning of his
military campaigns, of whom Le Sat was the most prominent.
Le Loi endeavored to maintain some sense of continuity with the Tran past by
rebuilding the tombs and shrines of the Tran royal family that had been des-
troyed by the Ming. He conducted sacrifices to all former kings and to all
prominent deities that had received royal recognition in times past. He also
reinstituted the blood oath and the royal birthday festival, which had been
abolished by Ho Quy Ly. These were occasions to encourage loyalty and to
distribute gifts among large crowds of new followers.
The business of rewards and punishments continued for quite some time.
Assemblies were organized to distribute rewards to various military units. In
1429, after a year and a half of investigation, a“register of merit” honoring
ninety-three men who had particularly distinguished themselves in wartime
service to Le Loi was published. An official was assigned to investigate anyone
claiming to have been unjustly left out.
Measures for dealing with those who had served Ming reveal that this included
a significant number of people. Stubborn Ming partisans who tried to avoid Le
Loi’s justice were tracked down and beheaded. On the other hand, those who
surrendered to Le Loi could regain their confiscated property. The investigation
to itemize the land and possessions of various classes of people who had served
Ming took ten months, and for several months after the completion of this
procedure officials were still sorting out the disposition of those who had served
not only the Ming but also the Ho, along with their families, dependents, land,
and property. The official dynastic doctrine was that the Le succeeded the Tran
dynasty, and that Ho Quy Ly was an unlawful usurper.
Administrative jurisdictions were reformed and regulations for conducting
censuses, collecting taxes, conscripting soldiers, and authenticating paperwork
were published. Government at village, district, and provincial levels was organ-
ized, and officials were assigned their posts. Literary exams to fill positions were
held in1429, 1431, and1433. Officials were called upon to recommend others
for appointment, but they were punished if anyone they recommended proved to
be incapable. Officials were investigated and categorized into four groups: first,
those with energy, acumen, and both literary and military skill; second, those
with energy, acumen, and knowledge of letters; third, those who could write and
do arithmetic; and the fourth category was for“others.” The emphasis on

“energy and acumen” expresses an appreciation for enthusiasm and intelligence,
and for being able not simply to follow orders but also to take initiative.
At the same time, several edicts were published against corruption, and offi-
cials were repeatedly admonished to refrain from evil and oppressive behavior.
Some such problems were a normal part of any administration, particularly at
the start of a new regime. However, there were likely to have been contradictions
between the Le dynasts, whose base of power was in Thanh Hoa, and the people
in the Red River plain, who for twenty years had been governed as a Ming
province. Ho Quy Ly, the first king from Thanh Hoa, never won the allegiance of
people in the Red River plain. Later events would show that Le Loi and his
successors mitigated this regional antagonism for a time but did not erase it.
In 1429, after a grand military review, four-fifths of the soldiers were demobil-
ized and sent to work in the fields. An especial concern of Le Loi was to put land
back into production. Abandoned and confiscated land was assigned to demobil-
ized soldiers and to other worthy people. Magistrates were instructed that no
land was to be left uncultivated. A new agrarian regime emerged out of Le Loi’s
legislation on land ownership and village government. There came an end to
large estates farmed by slaves or peasants in a serf-like status. Instead, villages
were organized on the basis of free peasants with enough land to support their
families and pay taxes.
This agenda built upon the work of Ho and Ming administrators. The Ho, the
Ming, and the Le all targeted the estates not only of aristocrats but also of
temples. Le Loi ensured that Buddhist temples were restricted not only in their
ownership of land but also in their manpower. He held an examination of all
monks to determine whether or not they would be allowed to continue as monks
or would be returned to lay life. The effort to put people into productive work
was reinforced by Confucian ideas about public morality. One of the first edicts
in1429 was against gambling, playing chess, and sitting around drinking wine.
During the Le dynasty, the standing army was primarily recruited from the
southern provinces. Le Loi collected weapons from the population in the Red
River plain. At the same time, arsenals and shipyards were established to manu-
facture new weapons and war boats. Several campaigns were launched into the
mountains against upland people deemed uncooperative in the modern province
of Lai Chau. Despite tribute missions from Champa and Laos, the Le court
nurtured a long-term desire for revenge against these kingdoms. Champa had
taken the opportunity of Ming rule to recover the territories that Ho Quy Ly had
conquered in1402, the modern provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. Laos
had assisted Ming in its pacification of Le Loi in1421–1422. The Le court would
take its time to prepare replies to these grievances. Meanwhile, more urgent
matters preoccupied Le Loi.

One of these was finance. Annalists observed that Ho Quy Ly had destroyed
nearly all coinage. As early as1428, Le Loi began to cast his own coins, but
demand was initially greater than what could be produced. In1429 the court
debated the issuing of paper money, but this was not done. After a few years, the
monetary situation was stabilized as the production of new coins gradually filled
demand.
An important matter was to regularize the tributary relationship with Ming.
For four years, Ming demanded the return of all Ming people and of weapons left
behind in Giao Chi. In fact, a significant population of Ming people chose to
stay, and Le Loi had no intention of forcing them to leave. Ming repeatedly
demanded that Le Loi find a Tran descendent to restore that dynasty, and Le Loi
repeatedly replied that none could be found. Finally, in1431, the Ming court
recognized Le Loi as king. Thereafter, relations with Ming were amicable and
uneventful.
Le Loi’s eldest son, Le Tu Te, was an adult and had held high positions in his
father’s entourage. However, he had a reputation for being rustic, rash, and
foolish, and Le Loi did not regard him as capable of being king. In1429 he
designated his second son, Le Nguyen Long, born in1423, to be crown prince.
Shortly before he died in1433, Le Loi demoted Le Tu Te and confirmed Le
Nguyen Long as his choice to succeed him. After Le Loi’s death, Le Tu Te was
ostracized from the royal family and eventually demoted to commoner status.
Le Loi led a rough and vigorous life, full of danger, daring, and drama. His
energy was spent enforcing order, discipline, and hierarchy, first among the
people in the uplands of the southern provinces and then among the Kinh in
the lowlands as Ming rule faded away. Rising as a frontier chieftain on the
margins where Trai and Kinh people intermingled, he mobilized the Trai to
make himself king of the Kinh. Although he established his regime at Dong Kinh,
the“eastern capital,” he also maintained a dynastic“home base” at Ho Quy Ly’s
old “western capital” of Tay Do, which lay near his native estate at Mount Lam
and near which he and his descendents would be buried.
According to a popular story, Le Loi’s achievement was made possible by a
magical sword that he received from Heaven as a symbol of his destiny. After
founding his dynasty, Heaven took the form of a great turtle that surfaced in a
Dong Kinh lake and reclaimed the sword as Le Loi passed by in a boat. Today, a
lake in downtown Hanoi is called the Lake of the Returned Sword (Ho Hoan
Kiem) to commemorate this mythical event.
Later Vietnamese historians have understandably chosen to see Le Loi’s war
with Ming as a war of resistance against foreign aggression, but it was also a civil
war between the Kinh and the Trai, between the Red River plain and the
southern provinces, between those for whom the northern empire was the source

of civilization and those for whom the uplands and southern frontiers were
places of freedom from the restraints of civil discipline. Le Loi built his dynasty
as an alliance between these two groups, but it was a fragile alliance, relying
upon unity among men from the south whose personal ambitions were a centri-
fugal force seeking new horizons of fulfillment. The alliance lasted for a century
before lapsing into a new civil war that continued in various forms for three
centuries. For three decades following Le Loi’s death, his generals became great
lords and enforced a peace in which educated men of the Red River plain
accumulated at the royal court.
Great lords and Le Nguyen Long
During ten years of warfare, Le Loi gathered a large entourage of battle leaders.
Ninety-three such men were listed on the1429 roll of honor. They were not
united by a common ancestor, as were the Tran princes two centuries before.
They came from many families and many places, and most of them held the Le
surname as an honorific, given to them by Le Loi in recognition of their service to
him. They were nearly all from the southern provinces and were illiterate. Later
court annalists quoted an unknown writer of a non-extant history to describe
them as“avaricious, boastful, licentious... everywhere putting their relatives
and favorites in positions of authority... openly corrupt... utterly stupid... like
a noisy swarm of bees... like dogs and rats baring their teeth... so thickheaded
that they could not tell the difference between a pig and a goat... so ignorant
that they did not know the four seasons of the year... full of envy and murder.”
This is seemingly an excessively jaundiced view, but these men probably tended
toward rusticity and arrogance. Le Loi kept them under control with his strong
will and severe discipline. After his death, the great lords who emerged at the
forefront of these men passed in succession across the stage of power, each being
pushed aside by the next. This came about because there was no adult king until
the1460s.
Le Nguyen Long was10 years old when he became king in autumn of1433.
He was precocious, strong-willed, and high-spirited. There are stories that his
mother had been particularly close to Le Loi, but she had died in the boy’s
infancy. According to one tale, in1425 she had volunteered to be sacrificed to a
local Nghe An spirit in exchange for Le Loi gaining victory and her son becoming
his heir. This unlikely story provided a popular explanation for her untimely
death and her son’s elevation to the throne at the expense of his elder half-
brother. Le Nguyen Long had made his way through childhood without mater-
nal vigilance. As a small boy, he had witnessed the final stages of the war with

Ming and the events of his father’s reign. He ostensibly ruled without a regent
from the time of Le Loi’s death. The adults who surrounded him were outwardly
deferential while busy with their own affairs.
Le Sat was the most powerful person at court. Although the young king was
consulted on matters of consequence, he was often at odds with Le Sat and with
other officials, showing that the court was in a certain state of contention, with
some people finding access to the boy king as a way of furthering their influence.
In recorded differences of opinion, the king always had the last word, which
indicates either the force of his personality or, more likely, the power of those
seeking to harness him to their ambitions. For his part, Le Sat carried the daily
burden of government, but he did not know how to deal with the boy king.
Already in the first year of his reign,1434, Le Nguyen Long found himself in
the middle of a long argument between two groups of officials, one aligned with
Le Sat and one seeking to push Le Sat aside in favor of those with royal blood,
including the king’s elder half-brother, Le Tu Te. After many arguments that
thoroughly frustrated Le Sat, the king was finally made to understand that
bringing his brother into the court would be a mistake, and the leader of Le Sat’s
enemies was exiled to a distant post.
Also in this year, two of Le Loi’s prominent generals who were not on good
terms with Le Sat suffered demotion or censure. Le Kha, who was Le Sat’s
particular enemy for unrecorded reasons, was demoted to Lang Son Province
on the northern border. Another man, Le Thu, was accused of using soldiers and
dynastic revenue to build an elaborate mansion, something many others of his
class were also doing. After lengthy judicial procedures, he eventually escaped
punishment in consideration of his former service. These two men, among others,
were eager to unseat Le Sat.
Le Sat had a habit of killing people. Shortly after Le Nguyen Long’s accession,
a conspiracy was uncovered and the leaders were beheaded. Not long after that,
perhaps still in a grim mood, Le Sat insisted on beheading a workman at a
Buddhist temple he was building who, reportedly suffering from fatigue, cited a
Confucian cliché to jokingly suggest that the drought then being experienced was
an indication that royal virtue was lacking. Then, when two officials were found
to be making a business of selling royal slaves to other officials, Le Sat beheaded
them. He routinely beheaded officials found guilty of corrupt practices. This was
about the same time that he became angry with Nguyen Trai over an argument
that Nguyen Trai was having with two other officials who wanted to change
some words in a document that he had written. Le Sat was easily angered and
expected everyone to obey him as his soldiers had done. He could not understand
why people had to get into arguments and behaved in what he considered to be a
disobedient manner.

Meanwhile the small headstrong king attracted much concern. In1435, one
official had the temerity to confront the king with six accusations: the king
refused to study with the teacher assigned to him; he disdained, scolded, and
ignored the governess who had been chosen by his father to look after him; he
shut his door against the palace“aunties” who attempted to correct his behavior;
he abandoned his studies to shoot birds with his bow and arrow, and when his
attendants tried to stop him he shot arrows at them; he shunned the children of
high officials sent to study with him and instead played with his servants; he
spent too much time with eunuchs and gave them gifts. Le Nguyen Long was so
angry at this series of rebukes that he sent eunuchs to harass the temerarious
official at home and elsewhere. However, the official persisted and explained that
he was arguing for the king’s best interests, and eventually the king relented.
Despite his adolescent exuberance, Le Nguyen Long seems to have had a rational
mind that could be engaged in argument and discussion.
A few weeks after this fuss, a case came up of seven criminals who were not yet
adults. According to the law, they deserved death, but Le Sat hesitated because he
realized that already there had been“too much beheading.” Nguyen Trai argued
for mercy, so Le Sat assigned him to take responsibility for rehabilitating the
young offenders. Within a very short time, Nguyen Trai reported that they were
incorrigible. Two were accordingly beheaded and the rest banished to remote
places. This demoralizing lesson in efforts to educate wayward youth resonated
with the problem of educating the king.
The king still refused to study. Nguyen Trai and other prominent scholars
were assigned to take his education in hand, but he would not cooperate, which
so infuriated Le Sat that for a time he refused to attend court and demanded the
death of a eunuch whom he considered to be corrupting the king. Finally, an
official reasoned with the king and explained the serious consequences of his
behavior for the whole kingdom and the episode passed.
Shortly after, the king was learning to ride an elephant, and when a wild deer
was presented to the palace he decided to set the elephant and deer to fighting for
sport. When the deer gored the elephant, the elephant in fear backed up, fell into
a well, and died. Le Sat and other officials put a stop to this kind of amusement.
The king held his peace, but he did not forget his accumulation of resentments.
Le Sat had made many enemies with his old-soldier no-nonsense mentality. He
had once gotten into a losing argument with a scholar over whether or not
widows and widowers should have a reduction in taxes. His argument was that
military people worked hard to protect the country and had to pay their taxes, so
it was not fair that people who contributed nothing to the country be given
special consideration simply because they had lost their spouses. He was very
protective of the martial legacy of Le Loi as he understood it, but he could not

grasp the arguments of scholars that were based on books and ancient history.
Meanwhile, the cadre of scholars at court grew.
The biennial literary examinations to select officials that were begun under Le
Loi continued until1435.I n1434, a plan for instituting regular literary examin-
ations in a five-year cycle was published. A preliminary examination that year
selected over one thousand to be given the right to continue their studies, the best
of them being allowed to go to the palace academy.
At the beginning of1437, an ad hoc examination in writing and arithmetic
selected 690 people to be assigned administrative posts throughout the country.
Education officers were dismayed by how the examination process was sub-
verted by the great lords who owed their positions to wartime merit. Such people,
in the words of the Confucian annalist,“were not fond of the Confucianists and
used them only for keeping records, preparing documents, and inscribing litiga-
tion; positions of responsibility were given to sycophants.” Great lords filled
vacant administrative posts with their followers and dependents, regardless of
ability. The annalists reported that half of those chosen in the1437 examination
had not studied but simply feigned knowledge in order to obtain an
appointment.
Le Sat was unaware that the king had nurtured a great hatred of him because
of how he exercised authority at court. He consequently found himself at a loss in
1437when the 14-year-old king insisted on appointing his enemy, Le Kha, as
commander of the palace guard. When Le Sat opposed this, saying that this
would cause him to fear for his life, the king summoned accusations of insubor-
dination against Le Sat and obtained his death. There followed a round of
promotions for Le Sat’s enemies and demotions for his friends. Among those
who benefited most were Le Kha and Le Thu.
The opinion of the workman executed early in Le Nguyen Long’s reign for
suggesting that bad government caused drought eventually became the official
view of the court. Year after year the country experienced both drought and
insect infestations that ruined harvests. The Dharma Cloud Buddha was brought
to the capital to pray for rain. Sacrifices were made to popular spirits and deities
in the country, also to the god of agriculture and to Confucius. Punishments for
criminal acts were reduced to show mercy as a way of eliciting rain. In1438,a
royal edict observed that the successive years of drought and insects might be due
to the king’s failure to appoint good officials, and consequently the king prom-
ised to try harder. Two years later, a similar edict was published. In these years,
Le Nguyen Long was coming out of his adolescent fog and becoming aware of
public affairs.
In 1437, the year in which he ostensibly came of age and obtained Le Sat’s
death, Le Nguyen Long presided over a reform of court music and ritual, the

details of which were entrusted to Nguyen Trai and a eunuch named Luong
Dang, who was a favorite of the king. The work on court music went smoothly
enough because the eunuch was uninterested and Nguyen Trai made arrange-
ments to his own satisfaction. Nguyen Trai supervised the manufacture of
musical instruments and sent stonecutters to make chimes. He also unveiled a
painting of stone chimes and explained the importance of music to influence
people toward study and good behavior. Luong Dang did not dispute Nguyen
Trai’s work on music, which was based on Ming precedents, and this part of the
task was completed easily enough.
In the midst of his work on music, Nguyen Trai also prepared a compilation of
Ho Quy Ly’s vernacular poetry in response to a request from the king. This was a
curious task considering that Le historians considered Ho Quy Ly to have been a
usurper and consequently a“bad” model for royal behavior. These poems are
not known to have survived, but there was apparently something about them
that attracted the interest of this teenage king. Perhaps it was a certain intellectual
adventurousness and spontaneity that resisted the orthodox verities of Song–
Ming Confucianism. At the least, this would explain the fuss that arose between
Nguyen Trai and Luong Dang when they turned to matters other than music.
The two men could not agree on clothing regulations at court. Luong Dang was
not a scholar and was uninterested in bookish precedents. He had his own ideas
about what would look good. The king chose his plan over Nguyen Trai’s
recommendation, which was based on erudition. Offended, Nguyen Trai asked
to be excused from any responsibility for this topic. More serious was the differ-
ence of opinion between Nguyen Trai and Luong Dang over court ritual. Again,
the king was inclined to agree with Luong Dang. Nguyen Trai held his tongue, but
another official exploded, excitedly affirming that ritual forms manifestedeternal
truths and that Luong Dang’s haphazard schemes would“destroy the country.”
This dire prediction infuriated members of Le Nguyen Long’s entourage, and the
intemperate official was banished, barely escaping with his life.
Beginning in1439, Le Nguyen Long led annual punitive expeditions into the
mountains against rebellious vassals. Around the same time he ordered that the
Ming people who had settled in the country must cut their hair and wear clothes
according to the custom of the Kinh people. He was getting out of the palace and
starting to pay attention to what he saw in the city streets and in the countryside.
Whether he had the makings of an energetic and intelligent king or would have
never overcome the feckless frustrations of his youth is a matter for conjecture.
The manner in which he dealt with the question of succession before his untimely
death suggests that he was easily manipulated.
In 1439, his first son, Le Nghi Dan, was born, and in the following year Le
Nghi Dan was made crown prince. In1441, a revolution among the palace

women deprived Le Nghi Dan of this position. Le Nghi Dan’s mother was
demoted for being “proud and obstreperous” and Le Nguyen Long then
announced that the question of crown prince was not yet decided. Shortly after
this,“wayward and insolent” palace women were imprisoned. Finally, an elder
half-sister of the king who had been captured and adopted by a Ming general,
then raised to adulthood in China before being repatriated during Le Loi’s reign,
was forced to commit suicide, being accused of endless conspiracies. Meanwhile,
two more sons were born, and the third son, Le Bang Co, born during the course
of the upheaval among the palace women, was designated crown prince. Le Nghi
Dan was demoted and assigned as prince of the northern border province of
Lang Son. The second son, Le Khac Xuong, was assigned as prince of the
southern border province of Thuan Hoa (modern Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and
Thua Thien).
The guiding hand behind these events in the women’s quarters was Nguyen
Thi Lo, Nguyen Trai’s young and beautiful wife, who had been assigned as
teacher of the palace women and who exercised strong influence over the young
king. Behind each woman in the palace was a family aspiring to greatness
through being related to a king. There were plots to induce abortions in rivals,
and, in this case, to rescind a decision already made about the crown prince.
Nguyen Thi Lo, an intelligent, well-educated, good-looking, and spirited woman
with the benefit of the king’s eye, was in the middle of these affairs. The king was
infatuated with her and kept her at his side“day and night.”
In early 1442, the pregnancy of a particular woman in the palace, Ngo Thi
Ngoc Dao, caused great concern. She was a daughter of Pham Tu, who had been
a follower of Le Loi and who was also a close friend of Nguyen Trai. There are
stories about the discovery of an image of the infant crown prince Le Bang Co
that was designed to summon demons to harm him. Nguyen Thi Anh, Le Bang
Co’s mother, was persuaded that Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao was behind this act of
sorcery. Consequently, there was a plot to harm Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao. Nguyen
Trai and Nguyen Thi Lo intervened to protect her, reportedly with hopes that she
might bear a son who would be king. There are stories of spiriting her out of the
palace to safety.
In early autumn of1442, Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao gave birth to a fourth prince, Le
Tu Thanh. Seven days later, the king paid a visit to Nguyen Trai’s home at Chi
Linh, around fifty kilometers east of Dong Kinh down the Duong River. On the
journey back, he was found dead one morning after spending the night with
Nguyen Thi Lo. She was accused of poisoning him. Twelve days later, Nguyen
Thi Lo, Nguyen Trai, and all members of their families were executed. Two
eunuchs who protested their innocence were also executed. The mother of an
unborn son of Nguyen Trai fled to the mountains of Nghe An. Twenty-two years

later, the boy received a provincial appointment when his father was exonerated
and given posthumous honors.
Insufficient information has survived to explain the death of Le Nguyen Long
and the alacrity of Nguyen Thi Lo’s and Nguyen Trai’s condemnation. Their
involvement in palace intrigues had surely earned them powerful enemies. Given
the eunuchs’suicidal protest, as well as Nguyen Trai’s later exoneration and his
venerable status in later historical and literary writings, everyone who has
written about him has assumed that he was innocent of the king’s death. After
all, he was credited with saving Le Tu Thanh, considered by many later histor-
ians as the greatest of all Vietnamese kings, from infanticide. Official historians
also assumed that Nguyen Thi Lo was innocent and attribute the king’s death to
“a sudden grave illness” or to“a malarial fever.” If the king’s death was from
natural causes, the fact that it was taken as an occasion to eliminate Nguyen Trai
and Nguyen Thi Lo suggests that powerful people perceived them as a threat to
their ambitions. If this was a regicide and Nguyen Trai was innocent, then casting
the onus of guilt upon him would have deflected blame from the conspirators.
Nguyen Trai was the most prominent of Le Loi’s wartime associates who was
not a warrior and was not from Thanh Hoa. Consequently, he was vulnerable
and defenseless.
For nine years, the Le court had experienced the vicissitudes of a rebellious,
adolescent, orphaned king who was susceptible to the influence of others and
finally mesmerized by Nguyen Thi Lo. It may appear as if he learned how to use
eunuchs and officials to have his way when he obtained the death of Le Sat. But it
is more plausible that Le Sat’s enemies, chief of whom was Le Kha, learned how
to use the young king to eliminate Le Sat. As Le Nguyen Long entered adulthood,
great lords and aspiring hegemons, taking a lesson from Le Sat’s fate, found
cause for dismay in the potential for the king becoming more unpredictable and
dangerous. Le Kha and Le Thu benefited from the deaths of both Le Sat and Le
Nguyen Long, but whether regicide was one of their means of advancement can
only be conjectured.
Great lords and Le Bang Co
Six days after Le Nguyen Long’s body was carried back to Dong Kinh, Le Bang
Co was made king. Nguyen Thi Anh, the queen mother, became the pivot of
authority at court. She was designated as regent to rule“from behind the
curtain.” She was from a Thanh Hoa family and established a working
relationship with Le Kha and Le Thu. She took care to educate and discipline
her son to the task of kingship with seemingly acceptable results. Later court

historians praised her wholehearted concern for public affairs, the respect she
showed toward the great lords, the care she took to follow established rules, and
her willingness to retire when her son reached the age of12. This rather cheery
interpretation does not take into account that she was also pliant to the intrigues
of others, was apparently forced into retirement with the fall of Le Kha and Le
Thu, and was ridiculed by a later writer with the cliché of a hen crowing at dawn,
commonly used by Confucian historians when referring to women in positions of
authority.
While the queen mother presided over the court, Le Loi’s old battlefield
associates attended to affairs beyond the capital. There were five such men
who in1442 stood forth to ensure an untroubled accession for Le Bang Co.
All five were prominent on the roll of merit published in1429. Le Kha, Le Sat’s
old enemy, was one of the five, as was Le Thu, who, although initially allied with
Le Sat, had been harassed by court officials for his extravagance and did not rise
to prominence until after Le Sat’s death. Le Kha and Le Thu formed a partner-
ship with the queen mother and their power grew during the1440s.
Two others of the five, Le Boi and Le Liet, had been early allies of Le Sat, but
they had mainly occupied themselves with leading soldiers on the frontiers in the
mid1430s and had escaped the palace dissentions of that time. They now
appeared at court and stood with those raising Le Bang Co to the throne. Le
Boi apparently did not care for court life. He was soon leading soldiers on the
Cham frontier, but then succumbed to a lingering illness. He felt well enough in
1449to pay a visit at court and receive a sum of money in recognition of his
service, but played no further leadership role.
Le Liet had been rising to prominence in the last years of Le Nguyen Long’s
reign. In 1441, amidst the palace intrigues of that year, he was assigned to
announce that Le Bang Co was crown prince. However, he was not part of the
partnership between Le Kha and Le Thu, and in1444 he was slandered to the
queen mother who imprisoned him and his family. His case could not be resolved
for lack of evidence, and he was finally released in1448 after the intervention of
several great lords and a princess. His wife and children were not released to him
until1450. He thereafter stayed out of the way until returning to the center of
court affairs in1459 with Le Xi, the remaining man of1442.
Le Xi had received a promotion after the death of Le Sat in1437, but nothing
further is thereafter recorded of him until1442. Like Le Boi and Le Liet, he seems
to have gravitated toward service on the frontiers. Shortly after leading an army
against Champa in1445, he was dismissed. By1448 he had been reinstated with
responsibility for administering the army, but thereafter he played no recorded
role until1459. In that year, he emerged to finish his career with an important act
of leadership and great honor.

Three of these five men are recorded with different surnames in some records
because they were given the royal Le surname as a mark of merit: Trinh Kha,
Dinh Liet, and Nguyen Xi. The careers of Le Loi’s generals in the mid fifteenth
century reveal a great diversity of characters with many vicissitudes and
intrigues, but few of these men became leading figures at court, and those who
did achieve prominence enjoyed but a brief time in the limelight.
In the 1440s, Le Kha and Le Thu managed to push aside Le Liet and Le Xi
and, with Le Boi in failing health, to gradually gain ascendance at court. They
exerted increasing influence over the queen mother and brought into their circle
of power a third great lord named Le Khac Phuc (his original surname was
Trinh). In1434, Le Khac Phuc’s younger full brother had been killed by Le Sat,
and he was demoted to a minor post. He had not immediately benefited from Le
Sat’s death because at that time he was under investigation for protecting an
official accused of corruption and with making unlawful appointments. He was
apparently slow to master the skills of maneuver at court, but by1445 he was a
major figure, and in that year his eldest son received a princess in marriage.
Le Kha, Le Thu, and Le Khac Phuc tightened their collective grip on the court
during three years of war with Champa. In1444, Cham attacks in Thuan Hoa
prompted Le Boi to lead an army to the border, after which he became ill and
played no further role at court. In mid1445, Le Xi was sent to attack Champa.
He was dismissed a few months later for an unrecorded offense. During the
winter dry season of1445–1446, Le Kha, Le Thu, and Le Khac Phuc all joined
an army as it assembled in Nghe An and advanced down the coast to modern
Binh Dinh Province. There, the Cham capital of Vijaya was taken and the Cham
king was captured. They appointed a new Cham king and surrounded him with
Chams who had resided in Dong Kinh during previous years. Three years later,
in1449, the man designated as the Cham king was killed and replaced by an
elder brother. Thereafter, relations between the two kingdoms began to
deteriorate again.
The Dong Kinh court was quick to report to Ming the details of the expedition
to Champa and to explain it as a response to unprovoked attacks. The Le court
was particularly sensitive to the Ming in these years because of a territorial
dispute that had arisen on the coastal border. The two sides held discussions
about the problem in1447 and 1448, and at one point a false rumor that a Ming
army was about to attack prompted an emergency mobilization of soldiers and
the collection of large amounts of beef and wine with which to beguile the
expected invaders.
Meanwhile, scholars continued to accumulate at court. The first examination
under the new academic system announced in1434 was held in early1442,
shortly before Le Nguyen Long’s death. This and subsequent examinations held

in 1448, 1453, and 1458 produced a total of eighty-nine graduates, although
only four of these were from1458. This was a new generation of educated men
who came of age in a time when, according to a comment in theComplete Book
of the History of Great Viet, “culture and education were in eclipse, those with
ability crouched under injustice, and old scholars were tossed into retirement.”
Many of these graduates would play prominent roles at court later in the century,
some of them still haunted by the fragility of civilized behavior. The examin-
ations were seldom without scandal. The top graduate in1448 was publicly
satirized with graffiti and street songs as “professor pig” when it became
common knowledge that he slept with his mother-in-law.
The great lords did appreciate and protect scholars who attended competently
to their assigned tasks. For example, Nguyen Thien Tich went to China three
times as an envoy to the Ming court and wrote an inscription for Le Nguyen
Long’s tomb. He was known for being strictly impartial when grading examin-
ations, which was so unusual as to be a point of particular praise. When, in1448,
another official who had falsely slandered him was caught embezzling tax
revenues, Le Kha had the man killed, even though the offense did not require
such a severe punishment, simply because he was so incensed that anyone would
dare to disparage a man of such integrity as Nguyen Thien Tich.
Le Kha’s presumption of authority at this time seemed to extend to the smallest
details. The whole court would periodically go to Tay Do for a holiday. On such
an occasion in1448 the local boys and girls in Thanh Hoa Province presented a
performance of dancing and singing, which Le Kha stopped because he con-
sidered it too lewd for the young king to see. Later that year in Dong Kinh he
ordered that a hunting net hanging in a palace courtyard be discarded so as not
to encourage the king to become addicted to hunting. He personally went to
convey the Dharma Cloud Buddha to the capital to pray for rain, and he also
made a trip to Tay Do specifically to build a shrine.
He supervised court appointments and judicial proceedings, advising the queen
mother about how cases should be decided. The employment of mercy and severity
appears random without more information but surely had to do with Le Kha’s circle
of friends and clients, and his list of enemies. In one case, the son of a great lord who
murdered someone in the marketplace escaped punishment in consideration of his
father’s merit. On the other hand, the son of another great lord was executed for
being a thief and a gambler and his father was demoted for having failed to control
him. An example of Le Kha’s idea of justice being disconnected from the opinions of
others comes from1449 when he insisted on beheading an official accused of
corruption despite nearly everyone else at court arguing for mercy.
For his part, Le Thu seemed more interested in reaping personal benefit from
his position at court than in exercising authority. In1448 his son was to marry

the 10-year-old elder sister of the king, who happened to be mute. His prepar-
ations for the wedding were attended by such extravagance and corruption that a
scandal erupted, which nevertheless was quickly smoothed away. Le Khac Phuc,
who was in charge of the wedding arrangements, had married one of his sons to a
princess three years before and was in the middle of many unsavory activities. He
dispensed royal largess by presiding over banquets at which gifts were distributed
to selected officials. He instituted the practice of examination officials taking a
blood oath as a caution against corruption, yet he admitted an unqualified
student to the palace academy in a transparent case of bribery.
The greatest failing of these men was their inattention to agriculture, to keep the
dikes in repair, to guard against the loss of harvests to insects, and to provide for
times of famine. Rural distress is a major theme of the era of great lord ascendancy.
In1445, a flood destroyed one-third of the rice stored in the palace compound; an
edict was published noting that there had been several years of excessive rain,
floods, broken dikes, villages being washed away, insects ruining harvests, ponds
drying up, and vegetables rotting on the plant. The edict, following Confucian
logic, suggested that these troubles resulted from bad government, so, in an effort
to make a new beginning, criminal punishments and taxes were reduced.
In 1448, there was more famine and prayers for rain. Once again an edict
lamented several years of successive floods, drought, and plagues of insects.
A year later, in1449, another edict noted drought, failed harvests, famine, and
misery. This edict expressed royal self-criticism and the same day there was rain.
Thereafter, altars were erected to worship all kinds of spirits, including the gods
of wind, clouds, thunder, and rain. Schools were repaired as an act of good
government to solicit rain. Le Kha and Le Thu sent a public message to the queen
mother suggesting that she consult more extensively with them in order to bring
order to the court and thereby elicit rain. When she issued a statement agreeing
with their suggestion, it rained again. But the overall situation did not improve.
In 1451, another royal edict was published about the chronic disasters in the
countryside. Questions were posed. Why is this happening? What can be done
about it? Many people were asking these questions, and the most plausible
answer was that something was wrong with how the country was being
governed. The standard Confucian explanation was that blame rested upon the
ruler and his ministers. The king was10 years old and represented by a regent.
With the country in such distress, the men who exercised authority in collabor-
ation with the queen mother could not hide from what were widely believed to be
the consequences of dereliction. Accordingly, in the space of two years, a shift of
leadership brought a new regime to court.
The 1451 edict was issued at a time when Le Kha’s harsh, increasingly
homicidal rule had infected the court with fear to the point that his enemies

gathered their courage against him. The queen mother was persuaded that Le
Kha was plotting against the throne, so she ordered him to be killed. Le Khac
Phuc was also killed since there seemed to be no way to retain one without the
other. Less than a year later, Le Thu was imprisoned for not preventing his son
from using sorcery to harm others. In1453, the queen mother was persuaded to
withdraw from court affairs, thus ending the regency. The12-year-old king, Le
Bang Co, began to personally hold court.
Very little is recorded from the six remaining years of Le Bang Co’s reign.
Coins were minted. A census was taken. Edicts on military discipline and public
morality were published. Le Thu was released from prison in1456. In that year
the king enjoyed a music and dance performance during a visit to Tay Do that
featured two favorite items entitled“Defeat of the Ming” and “The Great Lords
Come to Court,” indicating a congratulatory imagination fixed on past glories.
The most memorable event from this time for later historians was the comple-
tion in1455 of the official court history of the Tran dynasty, including the reign
of Ho Quy Ly and the era of Ming rule. Phan Phu Tien, a graduate of the1429
examination, supervised this work. It became the most important source of
information available to later generations about the Tran and about Ho Quy
Ly. Phan Phu Tien emphasized that the last Tran rulers were incapable and had
lost the heavenly mandate to govern and that Ho Quy Ly was an illegitimate
usurper. Thus, he presented the historical basis for proclaiming the Le dynasty.
Many obituaries of great lords are recorded as the generation of Le Loi’s
followers dropped away. But there remained a constellation of aging men who
carried the responsibilities of government. They had been previously elbowed
aside by the more ambitious men of their cohort such as Le Sat and Le Kha, who
had each attained great heights of power before being cut down. The survivors
tended to be men who had kept to the edges of the great factional conflicts of
their time by busying themselves in the provinces, leading soldiers on frontiers,
preferring the open life in the countryside to the headaches of palace intrigue.
Consequently, they were diffident about taking a prominent and open role at
court, even when the king’s youth would appear to require it. The fates of Le Sat
and Le Kha were lessons against seeking the limelight.
The most prominent of the surviving great lords were Le Xi and Le Liet, both
of whom had briefly come forward in1442 during the emergency of Le Nguyen
Long’s death, after which they faded into the background as others pushed
ahead. They were relatively sober men whose sense of public service was at least
equal to their desire for personal acclaim. They continued to stand outside the
circle of power, ready to step forward if necessary.
Many court affairs fell into the hands of the sons of great lords, but there was
no one of stature among them able to exercise leadership. Le Bang Co wandered

into adulthood amidst a royal entourage composed of elderly men filled with self-
importance and fond of recalling the deeds of their youth and the sons of these
men who had grown up learning how to leverage their fathers’ reputations for
personal gain. According to the comment in theComplete Book of the History of
Great Viet mentioned above, there was “injustice without appeal” and “all
public matters were upside down”; prominent civil officials were“almost 80
years old” and leading great lords“could not read one word”; “the young men,
without memory or forethought, acted with savage cruelty, and the old men, not
dying, became agents of ruination.”
The manner in which the reign and life of Le Bang Co came to an end shows
that proper attention was not being given even to the basics of palace security.
Court historians considered that Le Bang Co was a well-educated and well-
behaved young man who gave indications of becoming a good king, but he
lacked the benefit of experienced advisors able to ensure that routine precautions
were observed. One night late in1459, his elder half-brother Le Nghi Dan, who
as an infant had been demoted from being crown prince during the palace
turmoil of1441, benefiting from the complicity of a palace guard officer and
accompanied by around three hundred followers, climbed over the walls of the
palace compound with ladders and killed both Le Bang Co and the queen
mother. Four days later, Le Nghi Dan proclaimed himself king.
Le Nghi Dan’s feat of suddenly penetrating into the center of power, along
with his claim to the throne as a former crown prince, gave him an opportunity
to be king. However, it soon became evident that the homicidal manner in which
he had advanced his claim would be typical of his rule. Le Thu, who had survived
imprisonment during1452–1456, became one of Le Nghi Dan’s victims. Fur-
thermore, Le Nghi Dan was perceived as the tool of other men about whom
nothing has been recorded except their names and that they came from a region
in the Red River plain east of Dong Kinh. For reasons now lost, except for
conceivable conjectures based on class or regional animosities, these men and the
great lords regarded each other as mortal enemies. Resistance to Le Nghi Dan
among the great lords was ostensibly based upon their revulsion against regicide,
but eight months passed before Le Xi and Le Liet brought their men into the
palace to kill the regicide and his followers in an apparent act of striking first to
avoid calamity for themselves.
Le Bang Co’s other elder half-brother, Le Khac Xuong, played an ambiguous
role in these events, for which he was later killed. Le Xi and Le Liet passed him by
in favor of the younger half-brother,18-year-old Le Tu Thanh, whose birth had
been safeguarded by the intervention of Nguyen Trai. Two days after Le Nghi
Dan’s death, Le Tu Thanh was proclaimed king, thereby opening the most
celebrated reign in all of Vietnamese history. Bringing Le Tu Thanh to the throne

earned Le Xi and Le Liet great merit among later historians. It was also the last
event of any consequence that can be attributed to the great lords.
The nearly three decades separating the death of Le Loi and the accession of
his grandson Le Tu Thanh contrast sharply with comparable times in Ly and
Tran dynastic history. Whereas the Ly dynasty began with the successive reigns
of three strong kings and the founders of the Tran dynasty quickly organized a
collective leadership of talented kings and princes, in the early years of the Le
dynasty the royal family was eclipsed by a parade of great lords whose energies
were in large measure absorbed in mutual competition. This was an aspect of
Thanh Hoa political culture that became a fundamental feature of Le dynastic
history with the exception of the reigns of Le Tu Thanh and his son, Le Tranh.
Le Tu Thanh as teacher
In1442, only fourteen days before the death of his father Le Nguyen Long, Le Tu
Thanh was born in the countryside where his mother had found refuge from
homicidal intrigues in the palace. After three years, he was brought to the palace
to be educated with his three elder brothers, all being about the same age: Le
Nghi Dan, Le Khac Xuong, and the king Le Bang Co. According to the annalists,
he was in good relations with all his brothers and in particular earned the
affection of both Le Bang Co and Le Bang Co’s mother who was then serving
as regent queen mother. Annalists described him as unusually handsome, digni-
fied, intelligent, courageous, resourceful, humane, and decisive. He was drawn to
good and gentle people. Most importantly, he was diligent and untiring in his
studies. As time went on, he withdrew from contact with others and spent all his
time with books. The luxury of spending the energy of his youth in study made
him the most erudite man of his generation.
Tran Phong, an examination graduate of1431, was the head of the palace
teachers. Some historians recorded that he quickly perceived that Le Tu Thanh
showed indications of greatness. But others wrote that he favored Le Nghi Dan
and scorned Le Tu Thanh. When Le Nghi Dan seized the throne, like many other
officials, he had no qualms about serving this fratricidal king. Then, a few
months later, when Le Tu Thanh became king, Tran Phong turned to serve
him. For twenty-five years, Le Tu Thanh endeavored to give Tran Phong the
consideration due to a former teacher while at the same time repeatedly rebuking
him for his reprehensible behavior and urging him to mend his ways. Tran Phong
held positions in the judiciary and the Censorate. He became famous for
following the crowd while shamelessly fawning on people of high rank.

In 1465, Le Tu Thanh rebuked Tran Phong for joining others in lodging an
accusation against his own younger brother, thereby abandoning correct
brotherly feelings. In1467, the king turned the tables on his former teacher to
ask: “Why do you not read the books that illuminate the way to correct
yourself?” At that time, Tran Phong had joined a group of officials seeking to
denounce Nguyen Duc Trung, a man who had joined Le Xi against Le Nghi Dan
in1460 and who had subsequently become the maternal grandfather of Le
Tranh, the crown prince. Immediately after doing this, Tran Phong hastened
by night to the house of Nguyen Duc Trung to apologize. Then, seeking to
ingratiate himself further with the maternal family of the future king, he asked
to marry the daughter of Nguyen Duc Trung’s brother, Nguyen Yen. He finally
achieved this after spending an entire day lying prostrate in Nguyen Yen’s
courtyard. Le Tu Thanh observed that, in his unprincipled search for greatness,
Tran Phong“licked Nguyen Duc Trung’s hemorrhoids and sucked Nguyen
Yen’s boils.” In 1474, the king rebuked Tran Phong for his corrupt schemes
and asked:“Why do you not stop your despicable behavior so that you can have
a good name when you retire?”
Finally, in1485, Tran Phong was put to death, accused of obstinate disloyalty.
On that occasion, the official who prepared the accusation against him noted the
king’s repeated warnings and wrote that, among other things, Tran Phong
treasonously resisted Le Tu Thanh’s organization of the royal government,
denouncing it as imitating the Ming instead of following dynastic tradition. Tran
Phong’s dismal career introduces three large aspects of Le Tu Thanh’s reign: the
importance of education, an intense relationship between the king and his offi-
cials, and an unprecedented renovation in the structure of government.
Education was the cornerstone of the half-century“golden age” initiated by Le
Tu Thanh’s accession in1460. Of the2,896 men listed as having graduated at
the level of countrywide, or capital, examinations from the eleventh to the
twentieth centuries,502 graduated in the twelve triennial exams, from1463 to
1496, that were held during the reign of Le Tu Thanh, which is more than17
percent of the total. If we add the six additional exams, through1514, held
during the reigns of his successors before the Le dynasty began to collapse, the
total is714 graduates, which is nearly25 percent of all graduates in the history of
the country. In1484, steles were erected inscribed with the names of all capital
examination graduates beginning with the exam of1442. Thereafter, the names
of graduates were routinely inscribed on steles, which can still be seen today in
Hanoi at the Temple of Literature (Van Mieu).
Behind these few who achieved the honor of participating in the palace exam,
which was held to rank the graduates of the capital exam, there were thousands
who graduated from the regional exams, thereby earning the right to compete in

the capital exams. In1463, nearly4,400 men participated in the capital exam. In
1514 there were 5,700. An average of about4,000 men graduated from the
regional exams to participate in the capital exams every three years, and only
about1 percent of these graduated to take the palace exam.
The proportion of candidates to graduates in the regional exams was surely
greater than it was in the capital exams. The rules for entering the regional exams
involved an investigation into one’s family history, an evaluation of one’s moral
character, and a preliminary dictation test to eliminate non-competitive candi-
dates. Being away from direct scrutiny by the court until1492, when the court
took direct responsibility for the regional exams, the supervision of regional
exams was not as severe as it was for the capital exams. Consequently, the
percentage of regional candidates who graduated to take the capital exam was
certainly greater than the1 percent success rate for candidates at the more
rigorous capital exam. How much greater can be no more than conjecture, but
a hypothetical calculation based on a plausible yet conservative10 percent
success rate will yield an average of40,000 candidates at regional exams in
any given year.
The 1490 census reported approximately 8,000 village-level jurisdictions
throughout the country including the thirty-six urban wards that lay between
the royal compound and the Red River at Dong Kinh, the only“city” in the
country. There were at least seven different categories of rural village-level
jurisdiction. One of these, thexa, was the most typical form of lowland rice-
growing village and made up the great majority of village-level jurisdictions.
During the fifteenth century, the trend of Le dynasty administration of thexa was
toward fewer and largerxa as rural administration became more entrenched, the
agrarian regime became more systematic, and the population grew. Surviving
records do not enable any calculation of an average size ofxa in number either of
households or of population, but, according to one text, by1490 the number of
households in axa could range from fewer than sixty to more than600, which is
not a particularly precise or useful piece of information.
Taking the reasonable but arbitrary hypothesis mentioned above that in each
of the triennial exam years there was an average of40,000 regional candidates,
there would have been an average of five of these candidates for every village-
level jurisdiction in the country as counted in the1490 census. This is not
implausible and strongly suggests, even if it does not indicate with certainty, that
education had spread widely into the villages. Of all those who studied, relatively
few were likely to have gained admittance to the regional examinations, which
suggests that many others nevertheless attained a certain level of literacy.
Behind these thousands of examination candidates were thousands of students
preparing for examinations as well as thousands who failed and took relatively

minor government appointments or became teachers or went into the military or
turned to agriculture or business. They all had some modicum of literacy and to
some extent had passed through the discipline of a pedagogical process, learning
the rudiments of Literary Chinese and the prestige vocabulary. During these
years, the ambitions of young men for fame and fortune were to a large extent
focused upon the mastery of a curriculum based on philosophy, literature,
history, and government.
The examination curriculum during the reigns of the first three Le kings
followed educational policies established during the period of Ming rule. It
was based on the Four Books, which had been emphasized in Song Neo-
Confucian thought and had become the basis of orthodoxy for the Ming
dynasty. These Four Books were theGreat Way, Doctrine of the Mean, Ana-
lects of Confucius, and Mencius. These were philosophical texts that empha-
sized the importance of education in the development of human morality. The
curriculum published for use in the regional examinations of1463 included the
Four Books but not the Five Classics, which had been part of the curriculum
during the Tran dynasty. In1467, the Five Classics (Changes, Odes, Rites,
History, and theSpring and Autumn Annals) were published and teachers were
assigned to teach them in the palace academy. An edict noted that prior to this
time only theClassics of Odesand Classic of Historyhad been studied, not the
others, but that from then all of them were to be studied. The1472 exam
included both the Four Books and the Five Classics, giving particular emphasis
to theSpring and Autumn Annals.I n1473, there was an exam for teachers on
the Four Books and the Five Classics. Subsequently, the1475 exam contained a
more elaborate scheme of questions about the Four Books and the Five Classics
than there had been in1472.
The restoration of the Five Classics to the curriculum reflects an intellectual
eclecticism that eschewed a dogmatism based on authoritative texts oriented
toward ideological certainty in favor of more general fields of knowledge with
practical utility. TheSpring and Autumn Annals, along with its various commen-
taries, is a storehouse of historical situations with lessons for how to govern. The
Classics of Ritesand Classic of Changes contain blueprints for ceremonial
behavior, for analyzing the present, and for thinking about the future. Paying
attention to the Five Classics indicates a wider horizon of thought than is
generally associated with the Neo-Confucian school of Zhu Xi. The1473
teacher’s exam also covered the Tang poet Li Bo’s style ofphu (Chinese fu), a
Han dynasty prosodic form that had been introduced in the1304 exam of the
Tran dynasty and adapted into the vernacular during the early fourteenth cen-
tury. This is another example of turning to pre-Song pedagogical authority,
which cautions against a widely accepted view of this as a time when the Le

court adopted Neo-Confucianism. In terms of pedagogy, the Neo-Confucian
legacy of Ming Giao Chi was contextualized in a larger realm of erudition.
The credibility of the educational system rested upon a perception that the
examinations were administered fairly. Consequently, officials who supervised
the examinations were closely monitored, were quickly promoted or demoted
depending upon their performance, and were the recipients of frequent royal
edicts exhorting them toward excellence. In1492, presumably in an effort to
upgrade standards, the responsibility for supervising regional examinations was
given to court-based officials rather than being left to provincial officials. The
regional, capital, and palace examinations that dispensed academic degrees were
only the most prestigious in a broad system of exams, but they set the criteria for
objectivity that gave credibility to the many other exams that became part of
dynastic educational policy, including exams in medicine and astrology.
Those who taught the élite students who were accepted into the palace acad-
emy were kept alert to maximize the learning process. Edicts warned them
against taking books to their homes, thereby rendering them inaccessible to the
students. They were also instructed to arrange programs of study so that students
would not all be assigned to read the same texts at the same time, which would
inevitably cause an excessive demand for some texts while others were not being
read at all. This level of classroom detail as the subject of royal attention is
typical of Le Tu Thanh. He ruled as if his reign were one long study session for
the entire country.
Exams in letters and math were regularly organized for the children of offi-
cials, and sometimes for others as well, including soldiers and peasants, which
could lead to appointments in officialdom or admission to schools in the capital.
The lives of students at the capital were carefully regulated in terms of study
periods, levels of achievement, tax exemptions, and exemptions from labor and
military service. Poor performance led to assignments in the army. A particular
educational stream was created for the sons of nobles and high officials that led
to examinations for appointments in officialdom. If they failed they were sent to
study the military arts. If they failed the examination in military arts, which could
lead to military appointments, they were sent to serve as menials in adminis-
trative centers outside of the capital. In1478, an examination was held for
military officers to certify their skill in archery. The1471 expedition to Champa,
which was personally led by Le Tu Thanh, became an extended training session
for soldiers. The king published a book of instructions for military drill and
discipline for use during the campaign that was translated into the vernacular
and used“to teach everyone” as the army marched and drilled its way south.
Le Tu Thanh sought to create an atmosphere of study and of literary prowess
in his palace. When the crown prince, Le Tranh, was4 years old, the king

surrounded him with teachers. In1467 he selected thirty officials to take an
examination in writing tu (Chinese ci) poetry, six of whom he chose for the
luxury assignment of being allowed to do nothing but read books in the palace
library. In1471, Ngo Si Lien, a graduate of1442 who had not particularly
endeared himself to Le Tu Thanh with his equivocal behavior during the Le Nghi
Dan episode of1459–1460, was sent to work in the Office of History. Eight
years later he produced a work that reorganized the history of the Ly dynasty
written by Le Van Huu in the thirteenth century and the history of the Tran
dynasty completed by Phan Phu Tien in1445 and adorned them with his
commentaries. Later historians extended this work, entitled theComplete Book
of the History of Great Viet, to the end of the seventeenth century, making it the
official court history up until that time.
Ngo Si Lien’s innovation in historical consciousness was to extend the history
of the kingdom back to the time of the Confucian sages of antiquity. He did this
by drawing upon a collection of tales that were circulating among educated
people at this time, known today asStrange Tales Collected South of the
Mountains (Linh Nam Chich Quai). These tales were ostensibly written down
during the Tran dynasty based on oral lore then current among common people.
They had been subjected to a process of revision and rewriting to discard what
was considered lewd and demonic and to infuse them with Confucian didacti-
cism. Ngo Si Lien used them to give content to an ancient dynasty named Hung
that he purported to have ruled beginning in the third millenniumbce, preceding
the first dynasty in Chinese history. This dramatic and unprecedented excursion
into the past might conceivably be attributed to the episode of Ming rule. In
asserting a hoary imperial prerogative, the Ming could be imagined to have
provoked a counterargument negating that claim by making an even more
extravagant assertion of local sovereignty. TheLinh Nam Chich Quai and
Ngo Si Lien differently recorded the details of how the line of Hung kings
originated, but the basic idea is that the first king was acknowledged as the most
worthy of one hundred brothers. Half of the brothers followed their father to the
sea and half followed their mother to the mountains. Versions of this story have
also been recorded in modern times from oral lore among the peoples called
Muong and can be understood as affirming the common ancestry of upland Trai/
Muong and lowland Kinh. This tale became popular at the royal court in the late
fifteenth century because of the Le dynasty’s origins in the Thanh Hoa foothills.
In 1470, Le Tu Thanh published a book entitledDao Am Thien Tu(One
Thousand Words from a Wayside Cottage). According to the summary of it
that has survived, it described the analogous relationships between, on the one
hand, the unyielding authority of divine Heaven, of a sovereign ruler, and of a
husband, and, on the other hand, the responding pliancy of the Earth, of a loyal

subject, and of a wife, each of which willingly and harmoniously follows its
leading partner without compulsion. He was interested in how to exercise
authority without coercion. His literary interests seem always to have contained
an element of didacticism. In his later years, Le Tu Thanh gathered selected
officials to write poetry with him on assigned themes related to ethics and good
government and then published them in anthologies. He loved poetry and
enjoyed the excitement of competing to display literary skill.
As became the custom of the Le kings, early each year Le Tu Thanh made a
visit to Tay Do and to his ancestral tombs in Thanh Hoa. On one such occasion
he wrote about the scenery and terrain as he observed it while going up the Ma
River by boat. He used the imagery of a dragon and identified various features of
the landscape as the dragon’s nose, its mouth, its jaws, etc. His seeing“the
dragon” of sovereignty in Thanh Hoa symbolizes the historic reorientation of
political geography that had been underway since the time of Ho Quy Ly. Dong
Kinh had been the place of the“rising dragon” (Thang Long) for four centuries
and, according to some texts, before that it had on occasion been referred to as
the“dragon’s belly” (Long Do), the heaviest and most immovable part of the
dragon. Now, with the Le dynasty, the dragon of sovereignty had shifted south,
and for a time it would reside in Thanh Hoa. The“great lords” of Thanh Hoa
who had been mobilized by Le Loi became a force that would drive Vietnamese
politics for several centuries. One of Le Tu Thanh’s achievements was to wrap his
authority around these men and to subordinate them to his will. He did this in
two ways. He absorbed some in study and civil administration; for others he
offered war.
Le Tu Thanh as ruler
Most of all, Le Tu Thanh’s intelligence and erudition enabled him to stay ahead
of his entourage, to truly be“the leader” of the royal court. This was already
clear during the first six months of his reign when, according to court annalists,
virtually every aspect of government was in some way addressed. For three
decades the Le court had been an arena of competition among jostling great
lords, child kings, eunuchs, and palace women. Agriculture, the main source of
wealth for the kingdom, was neglected. Men of ability were elbowed aside by
clambering sycophants. The royal compound was not even kept secure for the
safety of the king. According to theComplete Book of the History of Great Viet,
“It was as if no one was there.” Suddenly, with Le Tu Thanh’s accession, a higher
level of brainpower was at work with royal attention being given to every detail
of public life.

The educational system produced unprecedented numbers of educated men.
Most of Le Tu Thanh’s energy was spent in mobilizing, organizing, supervising,
disciplining, admonishing, counseling, and enjoying the company of these
people. He created an entirely new kind of extended royal entourage with a
structure and a body of rules and regulations that enabled the royal will to be
effective beyond the palace walls to a degree never before achieved. The structure
was inspired by Ming imperial government but cannot in any practical way be
considered as comparable to it. The criticism attributed to Le Tu Thanh’s evil
teacher, Tran Phong, that the government had abandoned dynastic tradition to
follow Ming practice, was superficial at best; at worst, it showed nostalgia for the
corruption and disorder of earlier reigns.
In 1471, detailed administrative regulations were published. The basic struc-
ture was built upon the Six Ministries (Luc Bo) that had been the core of
imperial government in China for centuries and which, in various partially
adapted forms, had also existed in Vietnam since the Ly dynasty. In1466,L e
Tu Thanh reorganized existing offices into the Six Ministries. The Ministry of
Personnel (Lai Bo) handled administrative appointments, promotions, and
demotions. The Ministry of Finance (Ho Bo) handled revenue collection and
monetary disbursements, including the census and other tax-related records.
The Ministry of Rites (Le Bo) was responsible for education and examinations,
ceremonies and festivals, diplomacy, astrology, medicine, religion, theater, and
music. The Ministry of Justice (Hinh Bo) administered the courts of law. The
Ministry of Public Works (Cong Bo) was responsible for all construction
projects, fortifications, dikes, canals, steles, and transport/communication posts.
The Ministry of War (Binh Bo) supervised military affairs, including the palace
guards. Before the time of Le Tu Thanh, the specialized functions of these
ministries were for the most part handled by relatively low-ranking officials.
Le Tu Thanh gave the ministers a high status at court, just below the inner
circle of his military commanders and personal advisors. He also reinforced the
leadership in the ministries with each having two high-ranking deputy
ministers.
The most significant innovation of Le Tu Thanh, a departure from Ming
practice, was the formation in 1471 of the Six Departments (Luc Khoa).
A department was assigned to watch the work of each ministry to ensure that
all was done according to rules and regulations. Departments functioned as
inspectorates with power to report directly to the king. This was in addition to
the less specialized Censorate, which had existed for centuries to report irregular-
ities and corruption among officials. The emphasis on vigilance to monitor
performance and to evaluate results was a key factor in the remarkable success
of Le Tu Thanh’s reign. He understood the distance that separated the formation

of policy from its implementation and accordingly built into the structure of his
government a system for self-scrutiny.
Another innovation, dating from 1466, was to reorganize several areas of
responsibility into the Six Courts (Luc Tu) that performed specific tasks directly
related to the palace. The Supreme Court of Justice (Dai Ly Tu) was attached to
the Ministry of Justice. Four courts were attached to the Ministry of Rites: the
Court of Seals (Thuong Bao Tu) was responsible for safeguarding royal seals;
the Court of Ceremonies and Proclamations (Hong Lo Tu) organized public
events that displayed royal majesty; the Court of Sacrifices (Thai Thuong Tu)
conducted all sacrificial rituals on behalf of the king at temples and shrines; and
the Court of Banquets (Quang Loc Tu) organized official culinary occasions. The
Court of Equipage (Thai Boc Tu) was responsible for royal transportation and
procurement; its relationship with any particular ministry is not apparent from
information available today, but, at least, it must have had to coordinate with the
Ministries of Finance, Rites, and War. The Palace Academy (Quoc Tu Giam), the
most prestigious center of education in the country, collaborated with the Minis-
try of Rites in administering examinations and with the Ministry of Personnel in
recommending students for official appointments.
The Office of Academicians (Han Lam Vien) and the Secretariat (Dong Cac)
reported directly to the king. Many scholars simultaneously held positions in
both of these offices. They were experts in education, in writing edicts and
proclamations, and in diplomatic correspondence with Ming. Le Tu Thanh
tended to stock the Academy and Secretariat with scholars whose opinions he
particularly trusted. Other scholars, if they were not considered suitable for
administrative responsibilities, such as Ngo Si Lien, were sent to the Office of
History, which ranked rather low in the hierarchy of the court.
Provincial governments were organized as triumvirates of military command-
ers, civil administrators, and judicial officers. Censors were also stationed at the
provincial level. After1471 there were twelve provinces: four surrounding the
capital in the Red River plain, four in the northern mountains facing the Ming
border, and four in the south strung out along the coast. According to a map of
the kingdom prepared in1471, these provinces were comprised of54 prefec-
tures, under which were organized178 lowland districts and50 upland districts.
The dynastic hierarchy was based on a schedule of overlapping aristocratic
ranks and administrative grades. After the king (hoang de), the crown prince
(hoang tu), and lesser princes (vuong) came more junior members of the royal
family bearing the ranks of duke (cong), marquis (hau), and count (ba). The
ranks of viscount (tu) and baron (nam), which could be assigned to people who
were not members of the royal family, overlapped with the highest two grades
in officialdom. These were typically men with military assignments or who

personally advised the king and crown prince. Below these people were sixteen
grades. Examples of appointments in this scheme, in descending order, are:
commander of the palace guard; the Six Ministers; the head of the Censorate
and the commanders of provincial garrisons; the twelve deputy ministers, and the
provincial civil governors; the head of the Office of Academicians; the heads of
the Secretariat and of the Palace Academy; the heads of the Six Courts; the head
of communications and information; the heads of provincial judiciaries; prefects;
the heads of the Six Departments and the provincial censors; district magistrates;
the head of the Office of History; the head of land reclamation; the head of
stockbreeding; the head of water control for agriculture.
Members of the royal family received annual cash salaries in addition to
allotments of servants, salt makers, rice fields, ponds for raising fish, and mul-
berry fields for raising silkworms. Officials in the top eight grades received
annual cash salaries and allotments of land. Lower-ranking officials received
cash salaries only. In1477, Le Tu Thanh ordered an examination of the work-
load of all officials and a corresponding adjustment of their salaries up or down.
In1481, when available cash was insufficient to pay all the salaries, the king
ordered to reduce the number of officials by weeding out the incompetent,
corrupt, or unproductive.
The expansion of government had been significant enough that in1467 the
royal compound was enlarged because it was “too small and cramped. ”
According to a census of officialdom in1471, there were around2,700 officials
with appointments at court;70 percent of them were military. A similar number
of officials were in the countryside; of these, only30 percent were military. The
army and the navy were both headquartered at Dong Kinh, which is why
military officers were so numerous there. The army was organized under five
major commands, all stationed near the capital, in addition to which were the
palace guard units. Provincial garrisons, border guards, and local militia kept
watch in the countryside and on the frontiers. Le Tu Thanh met daily with his top
military commanders, and after every public session of court he met privately
with the commanders of the five armies along with the Six Ministers.
Le Tu Thanh was a keen judge of character and kept a sharp eye on the
thousands of men in his government. Early in his reign he established a strong
sense of connection between himself and his officials, praising and admonishing
them individually, revealing detailed knowledge of their lives, careers, and litiga-
tions. On one occasion he sent fruit jam to all his officials as a token of his
appreciation and as encouragement to work hard. Another early edict advised
officials against castrating themselves in a“foolish” effort to gain admittance
into the inner palaces, identifying a temptation that some ambitious officials may
have entertained. Time and again he issued warnings, rebukes, exhortations, and

words of appreciation to officials. He dismissed one military official because the
man’s son had galloped a horse through the streets of the capital and had let his
slaves beat people passing by; the official was held accountable for not teaching
his son how to behave. He once had an official beaten and banished because he
had failed to report corruption existing among those he was supposed to super-
vise. He dismissed a provincial official because“in his jurisdiction there were
many insects eating the crops yet he did not report it but simply sat and watched
calamity come upon the people.”
Le Tu Thanh paid particular attention to officials being recommended for
promotion. He would refuse to promote those he considered unworthy. He once
imprisoned an official for recommending someone he viewed as bad. He insisted
that a man must be in a position long enough to be evaluated before being
promoted to another assignment. Evaluations of officials were to be conducted
every three years, and supervising officers were punished if their evaluations were
not completed on time. Officials in remote upland areas could be reassigned to
lowland appointments after six years if their work had been good. If not, they
would have to spend at least six more years in the mountains. On the other hand,
officials in sensitive border areas were reassigned after relatively short periods to
prevent their“going native” and losing a spirit of vigilance.
Le Tu Thanh’s reign displays a constant stream of edicts instructing and
warning officials about bribery, corruption, dishonesty, greed, laxity, self-
indulgence, wild and undisciplined living, wine, women, marriage procedures,
marrying a woman from the jurisdiction where one was assigned, mourning
regulations, competition for burial plots, excessive feasting, laziness in collecting
taxes, not completing work on time, gathering with others for gossip and not
keeping office hours, hanging around the guard posts as if having nothing to do,
tossing betel quids in the palace yard before entering the court, correct dress and
ways of holding one’s hands at court, how to address one another, not taking
paperwork out of the office to one’s home, returning all papers when leaving a
position, not to speak of court affairs with family members or people outside of
the court, reporting at the palace first before going to one’s home when returning
from assignments outside of the capital, the preparation and submission of
paperwork, apportioning the workload between officials and their subordinates,
and the importance of filling vacancies promptly. The annalists record that, when
the extent to which the king kept a close watch over his officials became well
known, everyone became very careful about their behavior.
At the same time, Le Tu Thanh made it clear that evaluations, promotions, and
demotions were not to be a matter of public discussion or factional struggle; he
announced that if an official was at fault it was a matter between him and the
official and not a case for public accusations at court. He was famous for giving

those who had been disciplined, demoted, or dismissed a second chance so that
they might redeem themselves. He once revealed a sense of humor when he
satirized two officials who pretended to be ill in order to avoid participating in
a poetry competition; he suggested that their jobs were too demanding for them,
causing them to lose their health. He displayed a very rare mixture of strictness,
fairness, and mercy.
Le Tu Thanh valued the opinions of his officials. Administrative innovations
were often the result of suggestions made by his officials. He wanted his officials
to be perfectly open and honest with him, and he once issued an edict against
speaking equivocally. He eventually divided his court into three groups with
which he met separately: the heads of the Six Departments and the Censorate to
discuss the conduct of officials; the heads of the Six Ministries and of the Six
Courts to discuss plans and policies; the nobles and the military commanders to
discuss security matters. He made a point of insisting that everyone speak when
called on and that they address topics of discussion thoroughly, clearly, and
decisively; they were not to follow a faction or be evasive. One man was
appointed to be the“invigilator” for each court session; he was not to participate
in the discussion but was to bring charges against anyone violating the rules of
discussion. These arrangements reveal an effort to maximize the application of
group intelligence to any given problem.
In an edict of 1485, Le Tu Thanh expressed his purpose in building an
administration of officials trained to be moral and efficient. He proclaimed that
government had two main goals: to maintain the happiness of the people and to
nurture agriculture to provide enough food and clothing. He explained that
happiness comes from a moral life and that his officials must do more to teach
ethics to the people and to keep a close watch over the state of agriculture and the
moral behavior of the people, implying a connection between these two aspects
of rural life. Officials in the countryside were expected to react quickly to
drought, flooding, and other rural calamities. The king often inquired about
the condition of agriculture and the well being of the people. He made provision
to send out doctors with medicines to areas affected by epidemics. Local officials
were expected to instruct people in the laws affecting them, particularly laws
about land ownership. They were to take care in appointing village heads and
were not to allow more than one person from a family to serve as a village head
in order to avoid factions and feuds among villages.
Le Tu Thanh was aware of and engaged with how village people lived, both in
meeting their material needs through agriculture and as a society of human
relationships. As king, he believed it was his responsibility to ensure that govern-
ment be the best it could possibly be. He had no expectation of attaining
perfection. But, during more than thirty years, extending his voice beyond the

circle of his officials with the studied repetition of a born teacher, he endeavored
to raise the ethical consciousness of increasing numbers of people with exhort-
ations to moral excellence. His education had taught him that social morality
was fundamentally defined by Confucian ethics. He gave public honor to people
known for their chastity and filial piety. Abortion was prohibited. He issued an
edict forbidding singers and actors from ridiculing parents or officials.
Stories were later written about his view of Buddhism as a vain superstition
that wasted the productive energy of the people. But he was not an agnostic
about supernatural powers and advised his officials to pray to all available spirits
and deities in times of drought, flood, or pestilence. Village ritual life began to
change in the fifteenth century with the development of the village community
hall, calleddinh, as a place for the conduct of local administration and for the
worship of village protector spirits calledthanh hoang.
There are references todinh in Tran times as places to shelter travelers and
where Buddhist statues were sometimes placed. The distinctive architectural
features ofdinh with raised floors bring to mind stilted longhouses still found
in upland regions and suggest that there was a tradition of such structures for
community events. In China,thanh hoangwere protector deities of cities, towns,
and walled administrative centers. Beginning in Tang times and extending
through Tran times, three differentthanh hoangwere recorded for Dai La/Thang
Long. During the era of Ming Giao Chi, imperial officials followed the system
current in Ming China of establishing shrines tothanh hoang at centers of
administration down to the district level. During the reigns of the Le kings in
the fifteenth century,thanh hoangcults came to be placed in thedinh where they
were regulated as an aspect of local administration. Ritual observances associ-
ated withthanh hoangwere conducted by men, in contrast with the prominent
role of women and nuns at many Buddhist temples.
There is little information about Buddhism from Le Tu Thanh’s reign. In1467,
he decreed that Buddhist and Daoist temples that did not have“old thresholds”
could not be rebuilt without permission, implying some effort to place limits on
these religions. A1470 edict against people shaving their heads unless they were
legitimate Buddhist monks or temple wardens suggests a suspicion of people
seeking to impersonate temple dwellers to avoid field work. Despite this seeming
inclination to curb the activities of monks and priests, in1467, amidst an
invasion of crop-destroying insects, the king sent Daoist priests to exercise their
occult powers against the calamity; he also ordered that sacrifices be made to“all
the deities” to stop the infestation.
There were several recorded times of drought and hunger during Le Tu
Thanh’s reign and each time he responded vigorously. In1467, in addition to
sending Daoist priests against the insects and ordering prayers for rain, he also

lowered taxes due to the poor harvest. This same year a typhoon devastated
coastal provinces, breaking dikes, flooding fields with seawater, and causing the
deaths of many people. The king halted all construction projects in the capital
and sent the workers to help in the countryside. Soldiers were excused from drill
and training exercises to assist with repairing the damage from the storm,
including rebuilding the coastal dikes. The price of rice in Dong Kinh was
excessively high, so rice was transported from Nghe An where it was more
plentiful and cheaper.
The drought continued in1468 and prayers for rain also continued. When
rural distress led to disorders and banditry in the coastal province adjacent to the
Ming border, the king closely monitored the situation and sent new officials with
reinforcements to restore calm. Shortly after this, in1469, weapons were col-
lected from private homes. In1473 and in1476, droughts were combated with
prayers that were followed by rains. A drought that began in1489 led to harvest
failures in some provinces in1490. When people began to die of hunger, the
court distributed rice and declared a suspension of taxes. In1492, a famine was
met with people being instructed to plant and eat yams instead of rice. Le Tu
Thanh’s government paid closer attention to village life than any previous
regime. This resulted from the increase in the number of royal officials assigned
to rural localities, from the way that officials were organized to implement
policies and monitor performance, and from Le Tu Thanh’s repeated
exhortations.
Expanding the borders
Le Tu Thanh’s agrarian policy was based on Le Loi’s effort to keep all land in
production by nurturing a peasantry of small landowners able to support them-
selves and pay taxes. One of his first edicts was against idleness, exhorting rural
people to grow as much rice as possible. Tax rates for rice fields were fixed and
family registers, along with records of land ownership, were updated and sched-
uled for revision at six-year intervals. Land could be sold only under certain
conditions to prevent small landholders from selling land to pay their debts and
to prevent large landholders from accumulating more land than they could
cultivate. Mortgages dating from before the founding of the dynasty in1428
were declared void and could not be redeemed. Land disputes were to be settled
promptly by judicial officers. Severe punishments were announced for those who
took over the fields of others by force, pulled up or changed boundary markers,
or cut down trees and bamboo hedges belonging to others. Officials were
repeatedly reminded to check that all available land was in production. If fields

became waterlogged or dried out, officials were responsible for adjusting the
water control system to make them productive again. Coastal lands were being
brought under cultivation as early as the twelfth century, and, while this process
accelerated under the Tran dynasty, evidence of a major rise in the population of
the coastal regions comes from the fifteenth century.
This agrarian policy was designed for the Red River plain. In the southern
provinces, land ownership remained vulnerable to the greed of predatory great
lords. In1467, Le Tu Thanh lamented in an edict that although the region
around Tay Do in Thanh Hoa was the“homeland of the royal family,”“ prom-
inent local families” had unlawfully appropriated all the land there so that
members of the royal family could not find any available land to call their
own. There is no further information recorded about the rural regime in Thanh
Hoa, but Le Tu Thanh presumably shamed the great lords into making land
available for at least some prominent members of the royal family. This is very
different from the Ly and Tran royal families that, in times past, directly con-
trolled much of the most productive land in the country. Le Tu Thanh
endeavored to shift the basis of the dynasty from the pool of martial manpower
in the Thanh Hoa uplands to the peasantry of the Red River plain. As long as he
lived, this experiment was alive, but however much he brought rational govern-
ment to the Red River plain, the feuds and ambitions of Thanh Hoa men, which
had propelled the dynasty to power, remained in the background. Le Tu Thanh
sought to address this potential source of ruin by keeping these men busy with
military adventures.
Early in his reign, Le Tu Thanh ruled that military officials were to have no
authority over civil affairs. He also forbad military officials from engaging in
trade. He wanted to focus the concentration of his military officers on assign-
ments along and beyond the borders. In1467, after consultations with military
commanders, new instructions were issued to units stationed on the borders.
Incidents on the Ming border that year were followed by warnings to border
officers to be especially vigilant. An army was sent to attack Laos and returned in
victory. Military exercises were held at which regulations for issuing rewards and
punishments were announced. In1469, soldiers were once more sent into the
mountains to attack people along the Lao border.
Relations with Ming received careful attention. Envoys regularly departed to
and arrived from the Ming court. Close attention to border incidents was part of
Le Tu Thanh’s method of maintaining peace. This required demonstrations of
alertness and preparedness. In1472, indications of potential border trouble in
modern Quang Ninh Province triggered plans to mobilize soldiers from neigh-
boring jurisdictions. In1480, incidents along the border in Cao Bang and Lang
Son were promptly investigated. Le Tu Thanh decreed that all correspondence

with Ming about these problems be discussed and vetted by three separate
groups of officials to preclude any errors. At this time, perhaps provoked by
rumors about border troubles or some other unknown cause, the officials in
charge of governing the capital began to force all the resident Ming people to
return back north to their own country. Le Tu Thanh immediately stopped this,
rebuking the officials for overstepping their authority, for harming commerce,
and for destroying an important source of tax revenue.
Patrolling the northern border was not a task sufficient to absorb the ambi-
tions of military commanders. It was on the southern border that Le Tu Thanh
found opportunities to entertain the attention of his soldiers. After the expedition
to Champa of1446, Vietnamese efforts to hold the Cham king as a vassal
quickly failed and relations between the two kingdoms deteriorated. The border
was at Hai Van Pass between the modern cities of Hue and Da Nang. In1469,a
Cham raid across the border was recorded. In1470, a Cham army arrived and
besieged the Vietnamese garrison at Hue. The local commander sent appeals to
Dong Kinh for help. The alacrity and scale of Le Tu Thanh’s response shows that
this situation was anticipated. Within weeks, soldiers were mobilized, rice was
collected and transported south, and envoys hastened to inform Ming of what
was planned. Only three months later, at the start of the winter dry season, after
publishing detailed campaign orders to his generals and proclaiming in a long
edict the reasons for the expedition, Le Tu Thanh set out to attack Champa.
As he went south, Le Tu Thanh paused along the way to make sacrifices at
temples and shrines. When he rendezvoused with his soldiers in Nghe An he was
dismayed to find not an army but crowds of undisciplined men. He called in his
generals and warned them that their soldiers were acting“like children playing
games” and that he expected them to bring the army to attention. In the early
weeks of1471 as he moved down to the border and into Cham territory, he put
the army and navy under strict discipline and kept them busy drilling and
conducting exercises. He wrote a book of instructions for the expedition and
had it translated into the vernacular and taught to the men. He observed terrain,
corrected maps, and monitored the transport of rice to ensure that the expedition
would not run out of food. He also scrutinized the behavior of his officers and
occupied himself with promoting and demoting them based on his evaluation of
their ability. In short, he brought with him on campaign the clarity of thought
and the habits of critical supervision that he had been practicing for ten years
within the halls of the royal court. He was29 years old.
As he moved through modern Quang Nam and ascertained the disposition of
the Cham army, he devised a plan that was spectacularly successful. Marching
with his main force down the coast, he sent his right wing through the mountains
to lay an ambush and advanced his left wing by sea to land behind the enemy. He

soon had the Cham army surrounded, causing it to melt and scatter. He pursued
the Cham king and captured him at his capital in modern Binh Dinh Province.
A Cham general fled and established himself as ruler at modern Phan Rang, more
than250 kilometers further south. He and two others, a ruler in the Central
Highlands (the region of Kon Tum and Play Ku) and a ruler on the coast
immediately to the south of Binh Dinh, in the modern provinces of Phu Yen
and Khanh Hoa, submitted to Le Tu Thanh as vassals. The modern provinces of
Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh were annexed to become Quang Nam
Province. Le Tu Thanh assigned garrisons and appointed officials to be respon-
sible for this new jurisdiction. The Cham king was embarked with his multitude
of wives, requiring an additional boat, to be brought to Dong Kinh; he reportedly
died of illness en route.
Certain classes of marginal or undesirable people were subsequently settled
in Quang Nam. In late1471, descendents of people who had served the Ming,
unreliable upland chieftains, unsatisfa ctory royal slaves, criminals, resident
Chams, resident Laotians, and peopleof mixed Ming and local ancestry were
identified and selected to be pioneers of Le authority in the new lands.
Officials who were convicted of corruption or other offenses were sent to
establish administration there. Officials along the coast of the Red River plain
that had been devastated by the typhoon of1467 were particularly warned
that unless they worked harder to restore the dikes and return inundated fields
to production they would be reassigned to Quang Nam. Quang Nam was
categorized along with the northern border provinces as an unhealthy assign-
ment. Many Cham people remained in Quang Nam and Vietnamized their
names. In1472, an edict specified that these names could be only three
characters in length. At the same time an edict warned against Vietnamese
officials and people concealing their possession of Chams, presumably mean-
ing Chams unlawfully enslaved. In1474 as c h e d u l eo fb a n i s h m e n tf o rc r i m -
inals to Quang Nam was established with those guilty of more serious crimes
being sent further south.
Le Tu Thanh did not accompany the other major expedition during his reign.
In the1479–1480 dry season, a large army advancing in five columns set out into
the western mountains. It sacked Luang Prabang, the capital of the Laotian
kingdom of Lan Xang, and, according to Vietnamese annalists, continued west
as far as the Irrawaddy River in Burma before turning back. The return of this
army is not recorded, but the presence in Dong Kinh of the generals who led it is
noted by mid year1480 when Ming envoys inquired about reports from Ming
administrators in Yunnan that a Vietnamese army had attacked people on the
Yunnan–Burma border. A result of this expedition was that from this time
Vietnamese rulers considered it important to have a foothold on the Xieng

Khouang plateau of Laos (called the Tran Ninh plateau in Vietnamese and
known in Western writing as“The Plain of Jars”) to secure their western frontier.
The opportunities for adventure in Quang Nam and in the western mountains
momentarily occupied the lords of Thanh Hoa. In his later years, Le Tu Thanh
distributed gifts to those who accompanied him on his annual pilgrimages to
Thanh Hoa and made a point of publicly honoring the descendents of men who
had fought with Le Loi. He had seemingly pacified his turbulent dynastic
homeland. Yet, he harbored resentment at having had to endure the bluster of
old heroes. On his deathbed he reportedly said that he had erred in two regards.
First, he violated what was right in his desire for fame, seemingly referring to his
military conquests in the south and west. Second, he disturbed the government
by keeping in high positions incompetent men with merit from the past; he
named three men in particular, one of them being Le Liet, who, with Le Xi,
had raised him to the throne in1460.
A historian who was at court during that time lamented that Le Tu Thanh
“excessively visited women and consequently his body was afflicted with chronic
illness.” As a result of this, his senior queen, the mother of Crown Prince Le
Tranh, later known as the Truong Lac queen mother, had retired to a separate
palace and had no contact with the king as his illness increased in seriousness.
His symptoms were described as tumors, swellings, and open sores. Although
annalists did not name the disease, their descriptions of it and their observation
that it came from excessive sexual contact point to syphilis. When Le Tu Thanh
took to bed for the final time in late1496, the queen was allowed to wait on him.
She was apparently angry toward him, for historians recorded that she hid
poison in her sleeve and secretly applied it to his sores to increase the intensity
of his illness.
After proclaiming Crown Prince Le Tranh king and writing a final poem, Le
Tu Thanh died in early1497 at age55. He was the father of fourteen sons and
twenty daughters. Commonly called the Hong Duc King because the last twenty-
six years of his reign were counted as the Hong Duc (“immense virtue”) reign
period, he has been celebrated as the greatest king in Vietnamese history. Confu-
cian scholars in later generations viewed his reign as a golden age of good
government. His most significant achievement was to unite the human and
material resources of the Red River plain and the southern provinces and to
organize these resources to maximize prosperity and to push back the southern
and western frontiers. He did this by promoting education and by mobilizing a
generation of officials trained to respond to moral appeals. The military achieve-
ments would not have been possible without the unprecedented level of efficiency
in civil administration that he achieved, which produced the necessary supplies of
recruits and of rice.

The relatively short reign (1497–1504) of Le Tranh was a mild echo of his
father’s more famous reign. Educated by the best teachers available and by a
father with definite ideas about the responsibilities of kingship, at age36 he
stepped into the pattern of royal leadership created by Le Tu Thanh without
discernibly disturbing the established habits of government. For seven years he
gave the same kind of attention to education, examinations, appointments,
promotions, demotions, moral exhortations, relations with Ming, agricultural
production, local administration, and writing poetry that had been typical of his
father. And, finally, he died in the same way as his father, suffering, in the words
of the annalist,“chronic illness” from “excessively visiting women.” In providing
a worthy successor, however, he did not follow his father’s model.
In the fifteenth century, Le dynasty rulers effected a fundamental reorientation
of government and culture that established norms of public life that would be
honored into modern times, at least in word if not always in action. However,
this was a fragile achievement of one man’s unusual personality. Regional
tensions remained unresolved. When leadership faltered, these tensions erupted
into a series of wars between rival regimes that continued for three centuries and
that coincided with the expansion of Vietnamese speakers down the coast and
into the Mekong River plain.

5 THE BEGINNING OF INTER-REGIONAL WARFARE
Return of adolescent kings and great lords
Le Tranh had six sons. The eldest, although reported to have been intelligent and
well educated, was so obstinate that while still small he poisoned his mother
because she opposed his will. But what most disqualified him to be king was that
he liked to wear women’s clothing. The second and third sons were born only
seventy-five days apart in1488.I n1499, Le Tranh had designated the third son,
Le Thuan, as crown prince. He reportedly passed over the second son, Le Tuan,
because he was“immature, without moral goodness, incompetent, and
unworthy.” While the younger three sons and members of their entourages
appear to have played roles in later intrigues, no further specific information
about them has been recorded. Le Thuan’s mother, a royal concubine, had died
when he was small. His paternal grandmother, the Truong Lac queen mother,
was his adoptive mother.
Objections to Le Tuan being named crown prince were about more than his
personal qualities. His mother had begun as a poor peasant across the river from
Dong Kinh. Destitute, she had sold herself into slavery. When her owner was
arrested for some unrecorded offense, she was confiscated and became the
property of an official who brought her into royal service where she became a
servant of Le Tranh’s mother. Le Tranh took her as a concubine. She died shortly
after giving birth to Le Tuan. Another royal concubine named Nguyen Kinh
raised the motherless boy and attached her aspirations to the prospect of him
becoming king. Nguyen Kinh and members of Le Tuan’s mother’s family were
disappointed when he was not named crown prince. However, this did not put
an end to their hopes.
When Le Tranh died, despite his having designated Le Thuan as his successor,
there was a struggle for the throne among“all the princes.” Le Tuan appears to
have been the most determined of the claimants, but the actions of two officials
thwarted him. Dam Van Le, an examination graduate of1469, was Minister of

Rites and had possession of the royal seal. Nguyen Quang Bat, an examination
graduate of1484, was the head of the Censorate. They considered it their duty to
ensure the accession of the designated crown prince. Dam Van Le hid the royal
seal in his home and the two officials, with the support of the queen mother,
called on the nobles and high officials of the court to proclaim Le Thuan king,
which they did.
Le Thuan died after less than seven months as king. No cause of death has
been recorded. Le Tuan and his supporters moved with alacrity to take the
throne. The main obstacle to Le Tuan’s elevation was opposition from the
Truong Lac queen mother, his paternal grandmother. She was the daughter of
Nguyen Duc Trung, a prominent Thanh Hoa lord who had helped Le Xi raise Le
Tu Thanh to the throne in1460. She did not want her former servant, a peasant
waif and confiscated slave, to be the mother of a king, even posthumously,
because it would open the palace gates to her low-class relatives, a rabble of
peasants and slaves. Furthermore, she was endeavoring to bring another prince
to the throne. Historians have been unable to ascertain the identity of this prince,
but it appears that he was not one of Le Tranh’s sons. Her plans were in vain,
however, for a eunuch in Nguyen Kinh’s clique named Nguyen Nhu Vi moved
quickly upon Le Thuan’s death to seal off the palace and isolate the Truong Lac
queen mother from potential allies. It is recorded that large sums of gold passed
from Le Tuan’s surrogate mother Nguyen Kinh into the hands of certain great
lords.
Three months after becoming king, Le Tuan had the Truong Lac queen mother
killed. Several weeks after that, he obtained the deaths of Dam Van Le and
Nguyen Quang Bat, the two officials who had prevented his accession after the
death of his father. These two men, who stood in the first rank of officialdom,
had such a reputation for rectitude that their murders provoked a widespread
outcry of dismay. Le Tuan was consequently moved to cast all the blame for their
deaths upon Nguyen Nhu Vi and to have him killed. The murder of a queen
mother by a new king was not unprecedented, but the appearance of Dam Van
Le and Nguyen Quang Bat in the middle of a succession dispute is an indication
that Le Tu Thanh’s new structure of government offered the possibility of
scholar-officials participating in royal politics to an unprecedented degree. How-
ever prophetic for the future it may be thought to have been, their case was
nevertheless an episode enabled by the residue of Le Tu Thanh’s reign and not
part of a trend for the future.
In 1505, Le Tuan was17 years old. Gathered around him were relatives of his
deceased mother, men of low origins with little respect for the royal family. In
1506he brought into the palace the family of two sisters with whom he became
infatuated, making the eldest his queen. The family of these sisters claimed

descent from the mother of a Tran king and came from a village near the capital
named Nhan Muc, by which name the family came to be known. There was also
the family of the king’s adoptive mother, Nguyen Kinh, which came from Thuy
Nguyen district in the east of the Red River plain, just north of the modern city of
Hai Phong. The influence of her family members and of those allied with them
spread through the eastern plain and brought people from that region into the
capital. One such person was Mac Dang Dung, who was appointed an officer in
the palace guard in1508. Twenty years later he would be the king.
During Le Tuan’s short reign, his deceased mother’s family dominated the
region north of the capital and the Nhan Muc family dominated the region west
of the capital. Roving bands of armed men scoured the countryside for plunder
and for pretty girls to bring back to the palace. Villagers fled at their approach
and hid until they had passed.
Although the examination system continued to function and produced large
groups of new officials in1505 and 1508, the atmosphere of officialdom had
become stormy. Officials were dismissed or imprisoned for speaking against the
will of the king. Those who in previous years had been cashiered for various
offenses were reappointed. Those who had not supported Le Tuan’s accession
were killed. In one famous case, a relative of the king’s mother seemingly beat a
scholar-official to death and the corpse was tossed over the palace wall, but the
man revived as his family prepared to bury him, and he thereafter lived in hiding
until after Le Tuan’s death.
Le Tuan organized new groups at court, mainly using eunuchs and the rela-
tives of his birth mother, of his queen, and of his adoptive mother. He established
a new military unit to guard his palace and also units of men armed with staves
who staged mock battles for his amusement. He instigated a pogrom against the
Cham population at the capital that came from captives brought north in1471.
He reportedly developed a nightly habit of drinking himself into a stupor while
cavorting with women whom he afterwards murdered. The relatives of his
deceased mother who seized the powers of government presided over a homicidal
regime that produced shock and fear in the population.
Terrorizing common people was one thing. But Le Tuan’s crowd of followers
came to understand that the royal family was their mortal enemy and that with it
there would be a fight to the death. In1509, Le Tuan ordered surveillance on
twenty-six princes, his brothers, his uncles, and his cousins. One fled and was not
heard of again. The others were imprisoned. Only one of these managed to
escape after passing bribes to his jailors. He was Le Dinh, the second son of Le
Tu Thanh’s fifth son. Meanwhile, lesser members of the royal family and
refugees from officialdom gathered at Tay Do under the leadership of Nguyen
Van Lang, a brother of the murdered Truong Lac queen mother. Nguyen Van

Lang was leading an army out of Thanh Hoa when he encountered the fleeing Le
Dinh. Together they returned to Tay Do, issued a call to rally people behind
them, administered a blood oath, and marched against Le Tuan. There followed
days of bitter fighting at Dong Kinh, during which Le Tuan killed his prisoners,
including Le Dinh’s mother and three of his brothers (his father had died in
1502). These murders so infuriated Le Dinh that after Le Tuan was captured and
forced to drink poison the royal corpse was shot from a huge cannon with but a
few grains of ash retrieved for Le Tuan’s tomb. Le Dinh was proclaimed king
without delay. He was15 years old.
Despite the king’s youth, many officials entertained optimism about the future,
believing that after the reign of Le Tuan things could only get better. Luong Dac
Bang (b.1472), a graduate of the1499 examination, was a Deputy Minister of
Personnel when he was forced into retirement in the time of Le Tuan. Now he
was recalled for reappointment. He refused, being pessimistic about prospects for
improvement. His refusal was denied, and so he wrote a long appeal in which he
detailed how officialdom had been corrupted and listed fourteen points that he
considered necessary to correct the government. His fourteen points restated all
the essential lessons that Le Tu Thanh had endeavored to drill into the minds of
his officials during his long reign, revealing the shortness of the court’s insti-
tutional memory. It was recorded that the king agreed with what Luong Dac
Bang wrote.
The educational system continued to function normally. The examinations of
1511 and 1514 were held on schedule and yielded numbers of graduates com-
parable to previous years. In1512 an exam in reading and math was held for
children of officials to select students for higher study in the Confucian classics.
There was a strong interest in historical writing at this time. In1511, a book
produced by the court developed the points that had been made by Luong Dac
Bang. It presented a record of all the iniquities of Le Tuan and argued that now
there would be a return to the ideals and practices of Le Tu Thanh, which were
elaborately itemized. Also in1511, Vu Quynh (1452–1516), an examination
graduate of1478, presented a revised version of the history of the country that
had been compiled by Ngo Si Lien in1479.I n1514, Le Tung, an examination
graduate of 1484, presented an interpretive summary of the works by Ngo Si
Lien and Vu Quynh. Around this time, Dang Minh Khiem, an examination
graduate of1487, also wrote a book of history and a collection of poems in
praise of exemplary people in the past. The perspective on public morality and
good government shared by these men had been formed during the reign of Le Tu
Thanh. They sought comfort for the present in connections with the past.
Regardless of whatever degree of administrative competence that may have
been retrieved from Le Tuan’s witless reign, something had gone seriously awry

in the kingdom. It was easier to tear down a structure of government than it was
to build it back up. The disorders of Le Tuan’s reign had weakened, where it had
not removed, a regime of authority that had given decades of peace to the Red
River plain. The serpents of chaos had been awakened and were testing the
currents of change. Literally, in1513 and 1514, plagues of snakes emerged from
the Red River at high water during the summer rains. In1514 the infestation
lasted for four months. There was a constant shooting of guns and a beating of
drums in Dong Kinh to frighten the reptiles off. The dragon of sovereignty had
become a mass of writhing serpents.
In early 1510, shortly after Le Dinh took the throne, an attempted coup by
supporters of another prince led to a battle in the palace. Less than a year after
this, an official who had graduated in the exam of1508 and who had served Le
Tuan organized a rebellion northeast of the capital, the home region of Le Tuan’s
mother. This rebellion was quickly put down, but later, in1511, Tran Tuan, a
grandson of an official who had served Le Tu Thanh, led a rebellion in the region
northwest of the capital that was much more serious. As the rebel army marched
on Dong Kinh, the city’s inhabitants fled across the river for safety, leaving the
streets deserted. The king was so angry at what he viewed as cowardice that he
sent an official to investigate which families had sent their wives and children
away. When he discovered that this very official had also sent his family back to
his home village he had the man publicly executed. Armies sent against the rebels
were defeated and Tran Tuan’s men were breaking through the defenses of Dong
Kinh.
At this point, a general named Trinh Duy San, in desperation, strode boldly
into the rebel camp and slew Tran Tuan with his sword before anyone could
react. The rebels fled. Trinh Duy San was from Tho Xuan district in Thanh Hoa,
near Mount Lam, the hearth of the Le dynasty. He and his elder full brother
Trinh Duy Dai had followed Nguyen Van Lang and Le Dinh during the march
from Thanh Hoa against Le Tuan. The brothers were subsequently honored for
their service in raising Le Dinh to the throne. They had the same surname and
were from the same village as the woman who became Le Dinh’s queen, which
makes it likely that they were related to her.
In 1512, groups of Tran Tuan’s followers were still being tracked down
through the mountains when a rebellion broke out in Nghe An. The army sent
to suppress it was defeated and the rebels advanced into Thanh Hoa, causing
panic in Dong Kinh. Trinh Duy San once again proved to be the royal protector
as he led his men south and put down the uprising.
In 1515, Trinh Duy San successfully attacked rebels on Mount Tam Dao,
about forty kilometers north of Dong Kinh. A rebellion in Thanh Hoa later that
year was also suppressed. In early1516, the king, now21 years old, personally

directed soldiers that repulsed rebel armies gathered north of the capital. Two
months later, the most spectacular rebellion of this era emerged from the eastern
plains led by a man named Tran Cao. This provoked a series of events that
brought a sudden end to Le Dinh’s reign.
The great rash of uprisings in these years, emerging from virtually every part of
the kingdom, show that the administration emplaced by Le Tu Thanh had ceased
to govern. For more than a decade the kings were teenagers without the educa-
tion, the moral judgment, the experience, or the sense of duty needed to supervise
a structure of administration that could not be maintained without a strong,
competent royal hand. Moreover, it was not simply a matter of neglect. Like Le
Tuan, Le Dinh became a force of negativity at the center of the government. In
1513, a Ming envoy reportedly remarked to a colleague that“his face is hand-
some but his body is tilted; he is fond of debauchery and is nothing but a hog
king; rebellion will soon put an end to him!”
His appetite for women was seemingly insatiable. Large numbers of women
were brought into the palace. Annalists disapprovingly noted that he also spent
time with the women of his predecessor. He relished staging battles between
elephants and tigers. But it was his neglect of government and administration
that opened the countryside to rebels. His attention was absorbed with building
projects at the capital.
In 1512, amidst a drought and famine, he consulted with an engineer named
Vu Nhu To who had plans for a palace with more than one hundred rooms. In
1513, he announced a major construction project, which was the beginning of an
unending frenzy of remodeling and construction that involved expanding the
walls of the royal city, raising extravagant palaces, and digging canals between
palaces and West Lake. Over the next three years these schemes consumed the
energy of thousands of soldiers, laborers, and craftsmen. Presiding over it all was
Vu Nhu To, whose grandiose and constantly expanding visions gave pleasure to
the young king.
Agricultural work and military training suffered as peasants were dragooned
to the construction sites and soldiers were exhausted with digging and carrying.
The sucking of human and material resources out of the countryside and into the
capital, including the transport of logs from the mountains and of food to feed
the workers, disrupted normal military, agricultural, and administrative activity,
leading to chaotic conditions that encouraged rebellion. The king was apparently
unconcerned about this. He was not an astute ruler. He could not discern
between what was important and what was not. For example, he was constantly
sending people into the countryside to collect cotton blossoms; when a court
official objected to this wasteful practice he had the man demoted to a post in
Thanh Hoa.

However much misery he brought to his people, Le Dinh brought disaster
upon himself personally by turning against the royal family and the great lords
who were its protectors. In1514, excited by false accusations against prominent
Le princes, he had fifteen of them killed. Trinh Duy San, a stalwart of the dynasty
who had repeatedly risked his life fighting against rebels, had begun to irritate the
king with his arguments against the way he was ruling. The king had him
publicly flogged. It was a fatal error.
In late spring of1516, riding widespread rumors that a sovereign would arrive
from the east, a man named Tran Cao, from Thuy Nguyen district, just north of
modern Hai Phong, proclaimed himself king. He claimed descent from the Tran
royal family on his father’s side and from Le Tu Thanh’s mother’s family on his
mother’s side. He also claimed to be an incarnation of Indra. He gathered a
group of talented followers, including a Cham named Phan At, who became his
chief military strategist. In less than a month, Tran Cao’s army was camped at Bo
De, just across the river from Dong Kinh. Armies sent to dislodge him were
defeated and three royal generals were killed.
A new army was advancing to attack Tran Cao led by Nguyen Hoang Du. He
was the son of Nguyen Van Lang, brother of the murdered Truong Lac queen
mother, who had rallied against Le Tuan and raised Le Dinh to the throne.
Nguyen Hoang Du had ridden with his father on that occasion and had accord-
ingly been given honors upon Le Dinh’s accession. Nguyen Van Lang had died in
1513 and Nguyen Hoang Du was now the leader of the family, which came from
Ha Trung district in Thanh Hoa, about twenty-five kilometers east of Tay Do, on
the main route leading north from Thanh Hoa to the Red River plain. This
family would be prominent in Vietnamese politics into the twentieth century, by
which time it was the royal family. In the troubles of1516, Nguyen Hoang Du
was a potent but unpredictable figure. Just as he was about to attack Tran Cao,
news reached him that the king had been slain.
Burning with anger at being publicly humiliated by Le Dinh, Trinh Duy San
took advantage of the confusion in the palace provoked by Tran Cao’s approach
to track down the king and kill him. The princes and great lords who gathered
around the king’s corpse shed no tears, but they were in disarray about what to
do next. Two nephews of Le Dinh, both of their fathers having been killed by Le
Tuan, were considered candidates for the throne. Trinh Duy San favored
Le Quang Tri,8-year-old son of a younger brother of Le Dinh. Others proposed
Le Y, 16-year-old son of Le Dinh’s elder brother. The leader of those who
supported Le Y was murdered, and Le Quang Tri was proclaimed king.
Nguyen Hoang Du’s reaction to the news of Le Dinh’s death was not exactly
rational. Apparently dismayed that anyone would kill the king, he led his army
into Dong Kinh intent on seeking revenge against the regicides. Then, apparently

excited by the chaos that had seized the city and frustrated by what had become
of the kingdom, he went on a rampage of looting and destruction that found an
object of rage when he captured the evil architect Vu Nhu To, to whom he gave a
lingering public death that delighted the mob. Trinh Duy San, seeking to placate
Nguyen Hoang Du, sent Le Quang Tri to Tay Do and proclaimed Le Y king
instead; then, fearing what Nguyen Hoang Du might do next and perceiving the
need for more soldiers, he hastened to Tay Do with Le Y in tow. Nguyen Hoang
Du withdrew from the city as Tran Cao crossed the river and took possession of
the capital.
At this point, some people of reputation decided that Tran Cao held the best
prospect for restoring order to the kingdom. The most prominent of these was a
senior prince of the royal family named Le Quang Do, who had supported the
accessions of both Le Tuan and Le Dinh. He and others joined Tran Cao. Within
days, however, fighting erupted in and around the city as Tran Chan, an adopted
son of Trinh Duy San whose home base was in the region west and north of the
capital, fought a series of battles with Tran Cao’s general Phan At. Nguyen
Hoang Du soon joined him, as did Trinh Duy San, arriving with reinforcements
from Thanh Hoa. Only twelve days after entering Dong Kinh, Tran Cao was
forced to flee. Two days later, Le Y was paraded into the city as king. Back at
Tay Do, Le Quang Tri was killed to erase any future repercussions from his brief
abortive reign.
Fighting continued through1516 as Tran Cao was gradually pushed north-
eastward away from the capital. During the course of this fighting, both Phan At
and Trinh Duy San were captured and killed by their enemies. By the end of the
year, Tran Chan had driven Tran Cao beyond the Cau River. Tran Cao stepped
aside in favor of his son Tran Cung, shaved his head, and disappeared into the
monkhood. For the next five years, the Cau River was the border between the
competing dynastic courts of Le Y and Tran Cung.
In 1417, Nguyen Hoang Du and Trinh Tuy, a younger brother of Trinh Duy
San, joined their forces to campaign against Tran Cung, but without success. The
two Thanh Hoa armies returned to Dong Kinh, where junior members of the two
families publicly disparaged one another. Angry words provoked a feud resulting
in battles being fought between the two sides in the streets of the capital. When
the matter was discussed at court, the Nguyen spokesman accused the Trinh of
plotting to overthrow the king. In the uproar that ensued, a royal command was
obtained for the deaths of leading Trinh family leaders, including Trinh Duy Dai,
the eldest of the Trinh brothers and the nominal head of the family. Nguyen
Hoang Du took advantage of this to launch a sudden attack on the Trinh
warriors and to drive them out of the city. Trinh Tuy withdrew to Thanh Hoa.
Tran Chan, the Trinh ally based near Dong Kinh, then led his soldiers into the

city and attacked Nguyen Hoang Du, who was defeated and also took the road
back to Thanh Hoa.
Rise of the east
The fighting of1516 and 1517 had devastated much of the Red River plain.
Armed men brought destruction. Fire ravaged markets and villages. Famine
spread through the countryside. Officials watched helplessly or ran for their
lives. The dead lay unburied in heaps. The eastern part of the Red River plain,
in the region of the modern cities of Hai Duong and Hai Phong, neither of which
yet existed at that time, was least affected by the fighting but had become
dynamic and volatile. It lay off the beaten tracks between Dong Kinh and Thanh
Hoa and between Dong Kinh and the Lang Son border with Ming. It was
nevertheless open to the outside world by sea. Merchants from China and from
countries in Southeast Asia gathered at Van Don, the nearby island seaport.
When government faltered during the reigns of Le Tuan and Le Dinh, this region
quickly felt the slack and began to exude a spirit of energy and anticipation.
Le Tuan’s adoptive mother came from this region and the conduit she pro-
vided for local men to enter the palace was the first indication of this spirit.
Already in1511 rumors that a king would come from the east prompted the Le
court to send a group of officials to Do Son, the easternmost projection of land
into the sea, and today a major resort town, to perform an exorcism to dispel any
royal aura that may have been accumulating there. Tran Cao was from this area
and his followers were initially from this region, though after1516 they were
displaced by the vicissitudes of war and terrain to the northeastern corner of the
plain. There, just beyond Chi Linh and the Cau River, the royal pretension of
Tran Cao’s heir, Tran Cung, offered an alternative focus of loyalty apart from
the Le court at Dong Kinh, which was preoccupied with Thanh Hoa and its
seemingly inexhaustible store of great lords and their soldiers. In the dire condi-
tions of1517, two men in the east successively gained large followings as healers
and performers of miracles. They were both taken into custody and killed by
officials of the Le court.
By 1517, the east had begun to develop a political personality of its own. The
man who came to embody this personality was Mac Dang Dung. He was a
descendent of a famous scholar of the early fourteenth century named Mac Dinh
Chi, a man of very short stature but of high reputation for his astute and erudite
diplomatic work at the Yuan imperial court. A grandson of Mac Dinh Chi, Mac
Thuy, had been in the forefront of those who welcomed and served the Ming in
the early fifteenth century. With the rise of Le Loi, the Mac family sought

obscurity, moving from place to place. A grandson of Mac Thuy named Mac
Binh eventually settled in the coastal fishing village of Co Trai, several kilometers
west of Do Son at the entrance of the Van Uc estuary. Mac Dang Dung was born
in1483, a grandson of Mac Binh. He worked as a fisherman in his youth, was of
large stature, and had a reputation as a wrestler. But he also received an educa-
tion and passed an exam for military officers. As noted previously, he received an
appointment in the palace guard in1508. The details of his career in royal service
during the reigns of Le Tuan and Le Dinh are unknown, except that he received
promotions and obtained titles of nobility. He is reported to have secretly
attended the Do Son exorcism in1511, supposedly rendering it void.
During the fighting between the two major Thanh Hoa families that broke out
in the capital in1517, Mac Dang Dung was in command of soldiers stationed
south of Dong Kinh on the road to Thanh Hoa. When Tran Chan expelled
Nguyen Hoang Du from the capital he sent a message to Mac Dang Dung
instructing him to prevent Nguyen Hoang Du from returning to Thanh Hoa.
Mac Dang Dung ignored this message and let Nguyen Hoang Du pass. This was
his first major step on the political stage. If Trinh Tuy and Nguyen Hoang Du
remained occupied with each other in Thanh Hoa, the only person standing
between Mac Dang Dung and the17-year-old king, Le Y, was Tran Chan. Mac
Dang Dung moved rapidly to gain ascendancy over the royal court.
Mac Dang Dung endeavored to occupy the moral high ground and to gain
followers at court with two long missives addressed to the king in late1517.
They are full of classical allusions and express fully developed analyses of the
political problems facing the country. One of them denounced seditious supersti-
tion that thrived on popular ignorance and called for the death of a magician
who had stirred up a large following in the east. The other denounced the
unprincipled ambitions of great nobles and called for the death of Le Quang
Do, a grand duke of the royal family who had joined Tran Cao. With these
statements, Mac Dang Dung appealed to scholars and to Le loyalists, two
important groups that overlapped.
The bracing effect of Mac Dang Dung’s influence quickly spread through
officialdom and gave a brief moment of confidence to the royal court during
the first half of1518. The capital examination that had been scheduled for1517
and that had been cancelled due to warfare was now held. But the respite from
warfare was short. In mid1518, Tran Chan, the only plausible rival to Mac
Dang Dung, was arrested for treason and killed. His followers in the region west
and north of Dong Kinh quickly mobilized their soldiers and marched on the
capital. Dong Kinh was left deserted as Le Y and his court fled across the Red
River. In the turmoil of shifting the king from place to place, Mac Dang Dung
vied with others to control the royal itinerary, even resorting to murder. The king

sent a plea for help to Nguyen Hoang Du, but Nguyen Hoang Du did not stir.
Instead, Trinh Tuy came marching from Thanh Hoa to join forces with Tran
Chan’s people.
Trinh Tuy was aflame with the idea of proclaiming another king, but his
deeds were even more bungled than had been those of his elder brother Trinh
Duy San in1516. First, he proclaimed as king Le Bang, a fourth-generation
descendent of Le Khac Xuong, Le Tu Thanh’s elder brother and third son of
Le Nguyen Long. Then, for reasons no longer apparent, he discarded Le Bang
and instead proclaimed as king Le Do, ayounger half-brother of Le Bang. Le
Do and Le Bang had the same mother but Le Do’s father was a commoner.
Despite scraping the bottom of the royal barrel, Trinh Tuy rallied a credible
threat to Le Y’s court. This finally aroused Nguyen Hoang Du to lead his men
up from Thanh Hoa to attack Trinh Tuy and his allies. Defeated, Nguyen
Hoang Du returned to Thanh Hoa nearly as quickly as he had come and died
soon after.
By early1519, Le Y and his court were established at Bo De, directly across the
Red River from Dong Kinh and Mac Dang Dung was in command of all royal
soldiers. Trinh Tuy attempted to attack across the river on floating bridges but
was repulsed. There followed three months of drought, which allowed raiders
from the mountains to roam the lowlands on horseback for plunder. When the
rains finally came in mid summer, miring the raiders in mud and sending them
back into the mountains, the soldiers of the two Le kings once again concentrated
on each other. Mac Dang Dung attacked, captured and killed Le Do, and sent
Trinh Tuy, along with his followers, fleeing to Thanh Hoa.
In late autumn, Le Y and his court returned to Dong Kinh. With the elimin-
ation of any imminent threat, Mac Dang Dung spent the next two years building
up his military strength while his allies at court endeavored to re-establish an
appearance of normal government. Chief among these allies was Pham Gia Mo
(b.1476), a graduate of the1505 examination who was Minister of Rites. Pham
Gia Mo came from the same district as Mac Dang Dung and was also related to
him by marriage. In1520, the educational system was placed back on schedule
by holding a capital examination. In1521, a stele was finally erected to com-
memorate the graduates of the 1514 examination. The official assigned to
prepare the inscription wrote an essay that eulogized the efforts of civil officials
to do what was right for the people amidst all the turmoil and fighting during the
preceding years. It may have seemed to him that public affairs were finally on a
positive trajectory, particularly when, in the autumn of that year, Mac Dang
Dung successfully attacked Tran Cung and eliminated the remnants of Tran
Cao’s rebellion. However, it was but an interlude before the next major shock
in the death throes of the Le dynasty.

Le Y, now over20 years old, began to bridle against the authority of Mac
Dang Dung. Nobles and scholars who feared that Mac Dang Dung would bring
an end to the dynasty gathered around him and even managed to imprison some
of Mac Dang Dung’s followers. In mid1522, a series of events suddenly revealed
accumulated tensions. First, there was a great hubbub in the royal palaces when
“bandits” set off fires. Then, a rebellion materialized in the districts across the
river from the capital involving members of the nobility. Mac Dang Dung no
sooner suppressed this than Le Y fled from the capital to take refuge in Tran
Chan’s old stronghold northwest of the capital. There he mobilized local military
units and appealed to Trinh Tuy at Tay Do for help. Mac Dang Dung sent an
army against him but its commander was captured.
Mac Dang Dung then announced that Le Y had been kidnapped by rebels and
raised Le Y’s 15-year-old brother, Le Xuan, to the throne. In his haste to leave
Dong Kinh, Le Y had forgotten to take his brother and his mother along with
him. Mac Dang Dung’s next step was to abandon the capital and bring Le Xuan
and his mother to a fortified camp at Gia Loc district, fifty kilometers east of
Dong Kinh, about ten kilometers south of the modern city of Hai Duong. Here
he awaited events secure in his home territory.
Le Y returned to Dong Kinh, rallied his followers, and issued another appeal to
Trinh Tuy for help. Court officials now had to choose which side to be on. Many
were unimpressed with Le Y’s prospects for overcoming Mac Dang Dung and
hastened to join Le Xuan’s court. There followed weeks of fighting between
partisans of the two courts that sent soldiers chasing one another through large
areas of the plain. Mac Dang Dung’s men slowly gained the upper hand and
finally invaded the palaces at Dong Kinh, forcing Le Y to flee. Dong Kinh once
again became a battleground and Le Y established his headquarters on the
western edge of the city.
Trinh Tuy finally arrived with a large army. Suspicion of Trinh Tuy among Le
Y’s followers had spread during the three months it had taken Trinh Tuy to
appear after Le Y’s first appeal for help. Convinced that he was in danger of
being dethroned and using poor judgment, Le Y killed the general sent ahead by
Trinh Tuy to meet with him and had his head delivered to Trinh Tuy’s camp.
Enraged, Trinh Tuy captured Le Y and returned to Thanh Hoa. By the end of
1522, Mac Dang Dung had pacified the Red River plain.
In 1523 and 1524 there was another effort to regain an appearance of
normalcy at Dong Kinh. Provinces in the Red River plain sent their scholars
for the scheduled capital examination in1523, a census was taken of households
and fields in1524, and the Ministry of Rites compiled a list of113 spirit shrines
in the country. Mac Dang Dung’s brother, Mac Quyet, led an army to Thanh
Hoa that defeated Trinh Tuy and pursued him into the mountains. In1525, Mac

Dang Dung led a large army into the mountains of Thanh Hoa. Trinh Tuy
escaped and was not heard of again, but Le Y and his followers, including a
number of relatively prominent scholars, were captured and brought back to
Dong Kinh. Le Y was demoted, and a proclamation trumpeted the fact that the
country was finally united under Le Xuan.
Officials who had thrown their lot in with Le Y during his Thanh Hoa sojourn
now fled into hiding, committed suicide, were captured and killed, or submitted
to Le Xuan and begged for forgiveness. One official apparently received mercy
because he was famous for his sense of humor; he was sent to take a post in
Quang Nam on the far southern frontier where he died soon after. Another
official, Nguyen Mau, was spared through the intervention of Pham Gia Mo,
who had followed Mac Dang Dung since1519. Pham Gia Mo had high regard
for Nguyen Mau’s ability and integrity despite the differences in their political
loyalties. In1526, the scheduled capital examination was held and Nguyen Mau
led efforts to fill the vacancies in officialdom.
It was after Le Y was captured and returned to Dong Kinh that the direction of
events became clear, and the largest number of deaths for Le loyalists is recorded
in1525 and 1526. Four nobles attempted to flee to the Ming border but were
captured and killed. Five scholars were involved in organizing an unsuccessful
uprising in their home districts northeast of Dong Kinh and committed suicide or
were executed. Mac Dang Dung forcibly summoned three scholars to court. One
leaped into a river and drowned en route to the capital. The other two appeared
before Mac Dang Dung but were executed after one spit in Mac Dang Dung’s
face and the other threw a rock at Mac Dang Dung. At the end of1526, Le Y was
unobtrusively killed. This dynastic transition was the least homicidal of any yet
recorded since the founding of Thang Long more than five hundred years before.
With Thanh Hoa quiet, there would be no heroes marching north to keep the
Le dynasty alive. Mac Dang Dung was the master of the country. But how does
one change the ruling house? The way that Mac Dang Dung answered this
question combined ruthlessness with tact. He withdrew to his home village at
Co Trai. In the fourth month of1527 he received a delegation of nobles who
bore notice of his promotion from grand duke to prince and conferred upon him
items of princely regalia. In the fifth month, he journeyed to the capital where he
called on the king, who offered him a poem about the Duke of Zhou assisting his
young king in antiquity, the last pitiful throb of Le royal hope. After only six
days in Dong Kinh, Mac Dang Dung went back to Co Trai. In the sixth month he
returned to the capital amidst great public acclaim. He went to court to receive
the royal proclamation in which Le Xuan yielded the throne to him. After a small
flutter of resistance among the scholars called on to draft the proclamation, it
was done. A few months later, Le Xuan and his mother went the way of Le Y.

The manner in which the Le dynasty collapsed revealed the vital connection it
had to Thanh Hoa. The leadership of Le Loi and Le Tu Thanh were individual
achievements that rose above the raw martial exuberance of Thanh Hoa and its
hinterland, an exuberance that found a pivot at the Tay Do fortress and an outlet
in the newly acquired southern territories. The Le dynasty was the banner under
which the lords of Thanh Hoa claimed access to Dong Kinh and the resources of
the Red River plain. Mac Dang Dung led a response to this claim. He and his
successors endeavored to turn Thanh Hoa from a royal sanctuary into just
another province. Their eventual failure would be due not only to events in
Thanh Hoa but also to the material and human resources of the long southern
coast.
The early Mac dynasty
From the1530s there began an era of warfare among Vietnamese speakers that
would last until the1670s. There were two major phases of fighting. The first
phase went to the end of the sixteenth century and was a struggle between the
Red River plain and the southern provinces under the leadership of men from
Thanh Hoa. The second phase, in the seventeenth century, is discussed in the
next chapter and had to do with a struggle between the emerging south and
the“old world” of the north. The first phase brought a successful conclusion
to the two-century-long struggle of Thanh Hoa to gain dominance over the Red
River plain.
Much of the information that remains from this time is concerned with
warfare and the politics of dynastic competition. But there are also three other
stories. One is the story of educated people. All competitors for ascendancy
continued to hold examinations in which scholars were given an opportunity
to enter government service; some of these scholars have become important
figures in Vietnamese literary and intellectual history. The second story is one
of drought, flood, pestilence, epidemics, famine, and corpses piling up in the
countryside as dikes broke, irrigation systems became dysfunctional, rice granar-
ies were not maintained, medical systems broke down, men were taken from the
rice fields to the battlefields, and crops failed or were not harvested. This vision
of rural misery must be balanced with indications of peace and prosperity when
large construction projects were undertaken in villages on the Red River plain
that were related to the third story about money and religion. The men and
women who made fortunes bringing weapons and uniforms and food to the
armies invested their surplus capital in Buddhist temples, village community halls
(dinh), and spirit shrines. Old temples were repaired or rebuilt and new deities

and cults appeared as wealthy individuals endeavored to ensure the maintenance
of their ancestral cults and to obtain divine protection for themselves and their
property by patronizing centers of popular religion.
For twenty years the Mac dynasty was stable, peaceful, enjoyed good leader-
ship, and established a foundation for prosperity. In1532, the court annalist
recorded that merchants and travelers stopped carrying weapons to protect
themselves from bandits, nocturnal thieves and robbers ceased, and water buffa-
loes were allowed to graze freely without being penned at night for security:
“Items dropped on the roads were not stolen, and outer doors were not barred;
there were many years of plenty, and the country was rather peaceful.” Even
though in later decades warfare made its rounds, judging from inscriptions that
record the repair, renovation, or construction of village halls and temples, large
parts of the Red River plain continued to benefit from Mac government into the
1590s.
The few officials who were determined to resist Mac Dang Dung had already
met their fates in1525 and 1526 in the wake of Le Y’s capture. After Mac Dang
Dung took the throne in1527, members of the Le royal family and of families
closely allied with it, along with officials whose sense of loyalty to the Le was
finally insurmountable, fled into the mountains, took refuge in neighboring
kingdoms, or changed their names and withdrew into the obscurity of village
life. The number of these people has not been recorded, but judging from
indications of continuity at court it is unlikely to have been very significant.
Two famous suicides were recorded. Thieu Quy Linh, returning from diplomatic
work in China and finding a new dynasty in Dong Kinh, departed in retirement
to his home in Thanh Hoa; on the way he leapt from a bridge and drowned.
A scholar named Nguyen Thieu Tri, who had served Le Tu Thanh and had
retired to his home in the foothills northwest of Dong Kinh, was so angry about
his eldest son serving the Mac that in1533 at the age of92 he killed his son then
cut his own throat.
The vast majority of officials navigated the dynastic change successfully. Mac
Dang Dung made it easy for them to do this by maintaining the structure of
government that had been established by Le Tu Thanh. He quenched apprehen-
sions among officials by preserving the laws and regulations of the Le dynasty
and by continuing its system of education and administration that was the basis
for their careers. During the twenty-two capital examinations held under the
Mac from1529 to 1592, a total of484 men were graduated, an average of
twenty-two graduates per exam. Drawing upon candidates almost exclusively
from the Red River plain, the Mac rate of producing scholars is not as impressive
as that of Le Tu Thanh’s reign, but it compares favorably with subsequent eras
and is far greater than the forty-five graduates of the seven exams held by the

reconstituted Le court in Thanh Hoa from1554 to 1592, an average of fewer
than six and a half graduates per exam.
The most famous literatus of the sixteenth century is Nguyen Binh Khiem
(1491–1586). He was born into the erudite world of palace scholars during Le
Tu Thanh’s reign. His father was a prominent teacher and his mother was an
ambitious and highly educated daughter of a senior court official. Abandoned by
his mother when he was a child, Nguyen Binh Khiem was raised by his father. He
went to study with Luong Dac Bang, a graduate of the1499 capital exam from
Hoang Hoa district in the lower plain of the Ma River in Thanh Hoa. The Luong
family first became prominent at court in late Tran times. Branches of the family
existed in China; Le Loi had executed an ancestor of Luong Dac Bang for siding
with the Ming. Luong Dac Bang had an illustrious career at the Le court, but he
died fairly early after entrusting his son Luong Huu Khanh into Nguyen Binh
Khiem’s care.
Luong Huu Khanh became one of Nguyen Binh Khiem’s most outstanding
students. He entered the capital exam of1538 but quit the competition when
although earning the highest honor it was denied to him because his family was
from Thanh Hoa. He thereafter went to Thanh Hoa to join the reconstituted Le
court and ably served the Le restoration movement until his death in1573.
According to one story, he left for Thanh Hoa in chagrin after failing to gain
the hand of Nguyen Binh Khiem’s eldest daughter in marriage due to his poverty.
Following his father’s death, Luong Huu Khanh’s family had fallen on hard
times, and his mother worked in a Dong Kinh market. He lacked the necessary
resources to initiate marriage rites. Nguyen Binh Khiem instead gave his daugh-
ter in marriage to Pham Dao, son of a prominent official at the Mac court.
During the years of Le collapse and the rise of Mac Dang Dung, Nguyen Binh
Khiem eschewed public life and spent his time teaching. In1535, he finally
competed in the examinations, won the highest honors, and entered officialdom.
In1542, shortly after the death of Mac Dang Dung, he retired to his home village
in Vinh Bao district in Hai Phong, about twenty-five kilometers west of Co Trai,
the home village of the Mac family. According to one story, he retired after
unsuccessfully requesting the deaths of corrupt officials. There is no evidence for
this, but, for Le historians who wanted to portray the Mac as an illegitimate
regime, it put him in the protesting role made famous by Chu An at the dissipated
court of Tran Hao nearly two centuries before. In fact, he retired to avoid being
implicated in the intrigues of his infamous son-in-law Pham Dao.
Nguyen Binh Khiem built a school in his home village that became a gathering
place for students from all parts of the country. Consequently, he was probably
the most informed person in the country through the network of his students and
their families. Mac officials regularly consulted him. He was famous for his

mastery of the numerological method for consulting theClassic of Changes
(Yijing) that had been devised by the Song scholar Shao Yong (1011–1077),
and many tales survive about his ability to predict the future. He wrote prophetic
works that are still consulted today, and he is often called the Vietnamese
Nostradamus.
His most prominent student was Phung Khac Khoan (1528–1613), who went
to Thanh Hoa to join the Le restoration movement in the early1550s after a
succession dispute had broken the momentum of Mac leadership. Phung Khac
Khoan served the Le court for many years before eventually passing the Thanh
Hoa exam of1580; his subsequent diplomatic work and his poetry earned him
honor in his lifetime and the esteem of later generations. Nguyen Binh Khiem and
Phung Khac Khoan wrote poetry reflecting the views of intellectuals living in an
age of warfare. Phung Khac Khoan expressed an ambition to achieve personal
acclaim and an expectation that a time of peace would eventually enable edu-
cated people to make a better world. In contrast, Nguyen Binh Khiem expressed
a self-effacing renunciation of worldly ambitions and a perception of human
affairs being caught in cyclic forces beyond human will.
Nguyen Binh Khiem’s poetry is often conflated and compared with the poetry of
Nguyen Trai because, like Doan Van Kham in the eleventh century, they both
elaborated the contrasting themes of service to one’s country and of withdrawal
for personal cultivation. While Nguyen Trai’s poems praise the joys of retirement,
they remain tied to a sense of duty to serve the public good. Nguyen Binh Khiem’s
poetry, however, is less concerned with public service and more at peace with the
quiet country life. Both men lived in times of violence and change, but while Nguyen
Trai experienced military victory and political achievements, Nguyen Binh Khiem
witnessed a land caught in military and political deadlock. Their shared interest in
both public service and eremitic withdrawal and their exploration of these themes in
both literary and vernacular poetry inked terrain that inspired Vietnamese writers
for centuries. The poetry of these men was laden with standard clichés and well-
worn allusions to ancient texts, which appeared not only in poems written in
Literary Chinese but also in vernacular Vietnamese, showing that classical idioms
had entered the high-register vernacular of educated people. Their vernacular poems
also displayed aphorisms and turns of phrase derived from popular oralculture.
Another man who is generally considered to have been a student of Nguyen
Binh Khiem and who achieved a literary reputation is Nguyen Du, the son of
Nguyen Tuong Phieu, an official who graduated in the1496 capital examin-
ation. He was from the eastern part of the Red River plain, in Gia Loc district,
south of the modern city of Hai Duong, where Mac Dang Dung temporarily
fortified a royal residence for Le Xuan in1522. After passing a regional exam,
Nguyen Du received appointment as a district magistrate but retired after one

year. He is famous for initiating in Vietnam a new genre of fiction writing
modeled on the collection of stories entitledJian Deng Xin Hua(New Tales by
Lamplight) by the Ming writer Qu You (1341–1427). Nguyen Du wroteTruyen
Ky Man Luc(Record of Strange Tales), which was reportedly revised by Nguyen
Binh Khiem. Some of the stories in this collection are taken directly from Qu
You, others are more original, but all in some way follow the theme of human
encounters with ghosts, demons, and deities. Written in Literary Chinese,Truyen
Ky Man Lucwas subsequently translated into the vernacular and inspired many
similar works in later centuries.
Interest in this kind of writing resonated with a strong current in popular
culture at that time. According to a1589 inscription, the Mac court promoted
“the restoration of Buddhism,” an indication that Buddhism had been relatively
neglected in the fifteenth century after the fall of the Tran dynasty. The Mac era
was a time of very active building and renovation of Buddhist temples in the Red
River plain that expressed a revival of Tran dynasty architectural features and
decorative arts, including statuary. The Mac also encouraged popular religious
cults, which heightened interest in interaction between the realm of human
beings and the realm of divine and demonic beings.
References to the Jade Emperor are first recorded among the Vietnamese at this
time as presiding over a celestial court of deities who were sometimes incarnated as
human beings. A collection of over one thousand biographies of deities who were
the objects of local spirit cults was assembled in the1570s, a time when the
fortunes of war gave the Mac an era of relative ascendancy. One such deity was
the Princess Lieu Hanh, a daughter of the Jade Emperor who was supposedly born
among humans in the mid sixteenth century at Van Cat in Vu Ban district, about
fifteen kilometers southwest of the modern city of Nam Dinh, on the road to
Thanh Hoa. This place was a frequent wartime headquarters and stopping place
along the invasion route followed by armies marching both north and south
between the“two capitals” of Dong Kinh and Tay Do. A wide range of stories
from the sublime to the demonic are told about Lieu Hanh’s sojourn among
humans before she eventually returned to her celestial abode. She is still considered
to be a key figure in the pantheon of“Holy Mothers” who preside over a host of
spirits available to mediums and sorcerers. Her major temples today are located on
the invasion routes between Thanh Hoa and the Red River plain. Evidence
indicates that her cult appeared and flourished among women who accumulated
wealth in the markets that served the armies of that time.
Biographies of heavenly beings were compiled to textually authenticate them
as the official protector spirits of villages (thanh hoang) and to obtain the
recognition of their cults by governing authorities. The worship of these deities
was conducted in the village community halls (dinh) that were built in great

numbers during Mac times. Although the earliest survivingdinh date from the
sixteenth century, they existed before and began to assume the characteristics
and functions for which they are known in modern times from the fifteenth
century when officials reorganized the administrative and ritual life of villages
away from Buddhist temples. This effort by educated people to strengthen
Confucian ethical norms among villagers gained unprecedented force after the
chaos of the Tran Cao uprising and the subsequent years of fighting. Mac Dang
Dung enforced an era of relative peace and prosperity in which village life was
rebuilt. Thedinh became the center of village administration and of court-
sanctioned cults devoted to local protector deities. It became a ritual center
dominated by men in contrast to the Buddhist temples where women were
prominent and where, in the Red River plain, adjacent“mother houses” were
frequently built for the worship of female deities.
Records from the reign of Le Tu Thanh and from Mac times indicate that
Buddhist temples anddinh were often built with money contributed by people
who sought to have the ritual observance of their death anniversaries conducted
in those places. Laws were published by royal courts enforcing the obligations of
those responsible for conducting these observances after the deaths of the bene-
factors. Temples anddinh were a favored investment for those who accumulated
money in the markets. It not only gained them public recognition, prestige, and
the assurance of being remembered after their deaths, it also was the surest way
to put surplus wealth out of the reach of thieves, swindlers, and tax collectors.
The great surge of construction in the sixteenth century reveals an overflow of
wealth from the markets. This is reflected in the attention given to coinage by
both dynastic contenders. Beginning in the1530s, coins were cast both by the
Mac and by the Le in Thanh Hoa. While Le coins were traditional copper, and
are likely to have been manufactured in China, the Mac cast coins of zinc and
iron, giving them a distinctive color and heft.
The era of Mac prosperity was brief, for the men of Thanh Hoa and of the
hinterland that they commanded were unwilling to submit to the new dynasty.
The war that ensued brought decades of grief to people in all parts of the country
and finally restored Thanh Hoa’s dominance at Dong Kinh under the banner of
the Le dynasty.
Outbreak of the Seventy Years War
The Le restoration movement was initially led by Nguyen Kim, a son of Nguyen
Hoang Du who was briefly a major figure in the turmoil following Tran Cao’s
uprising in 1516.I n 1529, shortly after Mac Dang Dung took the throne,

Nguyen Kim assembled his family and retainers and went to Laos where he
submitted to King Photisarath (r.1520–1548), during whose reign the kingdom
of Lan Xang, based along the Mekong River at Luang Prabang and Vientiane,
enjoyed an era of power, peace, and prosperity. King Photisarath accepted
Nguyen Kim as a vassal and assigned him territory in the region of Sam Nua
at the headwaters of the Ma and Chu Rivers, which flow down to the sea
through Thanh Hoa. The Mac suppressed Le loyalist uprisings in Thanh Hoa
in1530 and 1531, but survivors found refuge with Nguyen Kim. In1533,
Nguyen Kim proclaimed Le Duy Ninh, an18-year-old son of Le Y, as king.
King Photisarath acknowledged this claim and allocated resources to support it.
Envoys were sent to the Ming court to denounce Mac Dang Dung as a usurper
and to request aid in restoring the legitimate dynasty.
The Ming emperor Zhu Houcong (r.1521–1567), like his predecessor Zhu
Houzhao (r.1505–1521), was not very interested in government affairs. Imperial
administration was enfeebled by neglect, corruption, and intrigue. The question
of whether the Le or the Mac were the legitimate rulers of the vassal state of An
Nam was ignored until1537 when officials prepared to send missions to tribu-
tary states to announce the birth of an heir apparent and there had to be a
decision about to whom the announcement should be addressed. Some officials
argued in favor of the Le and drew up plans for an expedition to suppress the
Mac. Other officials argued in favor of the Mac, citing interpretations of dynastic
policy toward small tributary states, the cost of such an expedition, and the
Mongol threat on the northern border. Although the emperor was inclined to
favor the Le, war preparations were kept in abeyance as border officials were
divided in their opinions and court officials were indecisive. Finally, the Ming
conceived a compromise solution according to which there would be no exped-
ition if the Mac would recognize the Le as suzerain. Mac Dang Dung’s rejection
of this demand triggered the expeditionary project, and by mid1540 an army of
over 110,000 soldiers had assembled on the border. Despite this, both sides were
looking for a way to avoid war. The Mac worried about the growing Le threat in
Thanh Hoa. The Ming worried about Altan Khan (1507–1582), the Mongol
leader who was beginning to pose a serious problem on their northern frontier.
Mac envoys met with Ming officials and worked out an accommodation.
Near the end of1540, Mac Dang Dung and over forty of his officials and
family members crawled on their hands and knees across the border bareheaded,
barefooted, and with ropes tied around their necks symbolizing surrender. Mac
Dang Dung presented tribute and administrative records to the commander of
the Ming army; he yielded a few parcels of border territory and begged to be
allowed to submit peacefully. The Ming army was withdrawn and within a year
the Ming court issued a proclamation recognizing the Mac as administrators of

their territory, albeit at a lower status in the scheme of tributary relationships
than had previously existed for the Le. The proclamation declared that it was not
clear whether or not the aspiring king in Thanh Hoa was really a descendent of
the Le royal family, but if this should eventually be proven to be true, the Le
would be allowed to administer Thanh Hoa Province.
By the time this proclamation was issued in late1541, Mac Dang Dung had
died. Historians later denounced his diplomatic settlement with Ming as an act of
servile capitulation. However, given the context of events, it was an astute way to
exploit the contradictions among Ming policymakers and a small price to pay for
Ming recognition and for peace on the northern border. Nguyen Kim was
beginning to send soldiers into the lowlands of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An and
the Mac needed to concentrate their resources in that direction.
One of those who gathered around Nguyen Kim in the Laotian uplands was
Trinh Kiem. He was from Vinh Loc district in Thanh Hoa, not far from Tay Do.
Some scholars have speculated that he was related to the family of Trinh Duy San
and Trinh Tuy, which was prominent in the uproars that ensued upon Tran
Cao’s uprising in1516, but there is no evidence of this. He reportedly grew up in
poverty and herded buffaloes in his youth, which does not suggest membership in
a prominent family. Nguyen Kim discovered that Trinh Kiem was good at
leading soldiers and made him his son-in-law through marriage to his eldest
daughter Ngoc Bao. It was Trinh Kiem who, during a famine in1539, led an
army out of the mountains and struck the first blow in what became a long war
by defeating a Mac army in Tho Xuan district along the lower Chu River in
Thanh Hoa.
The Mac had initially placed Thanh Hoa in the hands of a eunuch from that
province named Duong Chap Nhat. In 1532, an ambitious nobleman from
Thanh Hoa named Le Phi Thua had persuaded the Mac court to divide Thanh
Hoa and create for him a second command. In1537, he had gone over to
Nguyen Kim. His arrogance was insufferable and Nguyen Kim had him
strangled four years later. But his defection added to the turmoil in the province,
which gained momentum with Trinh Kiem’s victory in1539.B y1542, Nguyen
Kim’s men were attacking into both Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. In1543, Duong
Chap Nhat was besieged at Tay Do and surrendered, after which Nguyen Kim
gained control of all Thanh Hoa. In1545, Nguyen Kim was ready to attack into
the Red River plain. While camped near Hoa Lu in Yen Mo district, Ninh Binh
Province, he was invited to dine with Duong Chap Nhat, who poisoned him
before fleeing back to the Mac.
With Nguyen Kim’s death, Trinh Kiem became the leader of the Le camp. He
was a competent general who repeatedly demonstrated his battlefield prowess
during the next quarter-century. He was also a ruthless politician who was

determined to eliminate all rivals within the Le restoration movement. He
secured the death of Nguyen Kim’s eldest son, Nguyen Uong, in circumstances
that have not been recorded. Nguyen Kim’s other son, Nguyen Hoang (1525–
1613), benefited from the counsel of his mother’s elder brother Nguyen U Di,
who had raised him during his father’s sojourn in Laos, and feigned insanity to
deflect Trinh Kiem’s suspicious eye. In1546, Trinh Kiem gained the submission
of all the provinces south of Thanh Hoa and the situation shifted rapidly in his
favor as the Mac fell into a prolonged succession dispute.
Mac Dang Dung had apparently endeavored to establish a dynastic system
modeled on the Tran by raising his son Mac Dang Doanh to be king in1530
while he became the senior king. When Mac Dang Doanh died in1540, his eldest
son Mac Phuc Hai replaced him as king. But when Mac Dang Dung died a year
later and Mac Phuc Hai might have replaced him as senior king, Mac Phuc Hai
had no adult son to make king. Then, when Mac Phuc Hai died in1546,a
dispute erupted over the succession. Mac Phuc Hai had an infant son named Mac
Phuc Nguyen, who, following the practice of primogeniture, held first claim on
the throne. However, a general named Pham Tu Nghi argued that, considering
the perilous situation in Thanh Hoa, the dynasty could not afford to have a child
king. He championed the cause of Mac Chinh Trung, a younger son of Mac
Dang Dung, and attracted a large following in the home region of the Mac
family.
Opposed to him was the Mac court in Dong Kinh led by Mac Dang Doanh’s
third son Mac Kinh Dien, who stood up on behalf of his small nephew Mac Phuc
Nguyen. Pham Dao, Nguyen Binh Khiem’s son-in-law, was among those
favoring Mac Phuc Nguyen. He was on very close terms with Mac Kinh Dien
because his mother had been Mac Kinh Dien’s wet nurse and was credited with
saving him from a sickly infancy. Mac Kinh Dien fought Pham Tu Nghi for five
years in the eastern plains and along the northern coast until capturing and
beheading him in1551. Mac Chinh Trung fled across the Ming border for
refuge. These events provoked border problems and led to years of discussions
with Ming envoys. As if this were not enough trouble for the Mac court, Pham
Dao’s schemes brought further difficulties, fulfilling the apprehensions that had
led to his father-in-law Nguyen Binh Khiem’s retirement a few years earlier.
While Mac Kinh Dien was busy with Pham Tu Nghi, a feud developed
between Pham Dao’s family and the family of Le Ba Ly, the Mac general in
command of the army facing Thanh Hoa and the most senior Mac commander
after Mac Kinh Dien. Le Ba Ly was originally from Thanh Hoa but he main-
tained a residence in the same village near Dong Kinh that was the home village
of Pham Dao. For unrecorded reasons, the two families nurtured enmity against
one another. Pham Dao denounced Le Ba Ly as a traitor at court and obtained a

royal order for his arrest. However, Le Ba Ly had many friends and allies. He
happened to be the father-in-law of Nguyen Quyen, son of Nguyen Thien, who
was the Minister of Personnel and a senior member of the court. Nguyen Thien,
an examination graduate of1532, had been a classmate of Nguyen Binh Khiem,
and Nguyen Quyen had been Nguyen Binh Khiem’s student. In 1550, when
Pham Dao’s influence proved insurmountable at court, Le Ba Ly, Nguyen Thien,
and other prominent men along with their families and retainers went to Thanh
Hoa and submitted to the Le, leaving the southern border defenseless. Pham
Dao’s baleful manipulations continued until1562 when, accused of treachery, he
was finally killed by the Mac.
In 1551, Trinh Kiem sent Le Ba Ly and others into the Red River plain against
Dong Kinh. The Mac court fled to the safety of the eastern plains as Mac Kinh
Dien guarded the capital until the Le forces withdrew. Thereafter, the two sides
concentrated upon recruiting, training, arming, and organizing their armies.
Finally, in1555, Mac Kinh Dien led a large army up the Ma River against Trinh
Kiem. A short distance downriver from his headquarters near Tay Do, Trinh
Kiem ambushed and defeated the Mac. In1557, Mac Kinh Dien again invaded
Thanh Hoa and was again defeated. Trinh Kiem followed up this victory by
pursuing the Mac army into Ninh Binh Province in the Red River plain. There, he
defeated it again in a battle from which Mac Kinh Dien barely escaped with his
life. A Mac seaborne invasion of Nghe An drew Trinh Kiem back south, but,
after defeating it, Trinh Kiem renewed his invasion of the Red River plain. In a
major battle on the Giao Thuy River in Truc Ninh district, Nam Dinh Province,
he suffered a serious defeat near the end of the year and returned to Thanh Hoa
to rebuild his forces. After the battles of1557, both sides were exhausted and
needed time to rebuild their armies.
During the course of these battles, both Le Ba Ly and Nguyen Thien had died,
whether in battle or of natural causes is not recorded. Nguyen Thien’s son,
Nguyen Quyen, retained a sense of loyalty to the Mac despite the family feud
that had taken him into the Le camp. With his father and father-in-law both
dead, he was susceptible to an appeal from his former teacher Nguyen Binh
Khiem, who sent him a poem and then arranged to meet him, facilitating his
return to the Mac camp. Nguyen Quyen was a gifted military leader and became
one of the most celebrated of the Mac generals.
During this time, Trinh Kiem resolved a small dynastic question. King Le Duy
Ninh had died in1548 and was succeeded by his son Le Duy Huyen. When Le
Duy Huyen died without an heir in1556, Trinh Kiem was said to have consulted
Phung Khac Khoan about what to do. The dilemma was supposedly about
whether or not to declare the Le family line to be dead, possibly opening the
way for Trinh Kiem to claim the throne. According to a story recorded later,

Phung Khac Khoan sent a relative to seek the counsel of his teacher Nguyen Binh
Khiem, whose reply indicated that when a crop fails, one should plant seeds
obtained from earlier harvests. Trinh Kiem subsequently found Le Duy Bang, a
fifth-generation descendent of Le Loi’s second eldest brother, and made him
king. In fact, Trinh Kiem had little practical alternative to this, for his leadership
was based on loyalty to the Le and any effort to change that would have
provoked an uproar among his followers.
The idea of consulting Nguyen Binh Khiem was later used to explain how
another quasi-dynastic question was resolved at that time. The mother of
Nguyen Kim’s son Nguyen Hoang was from a locality near Nguyen Binh
Khiem’s home village. According to this story, she was concerned for the future
of her son and sent an emissary to consult Nguyen Binh Khiem, whose reply
indicated that Nguyen Hoang should go into the south beyond Ngang Pass. In
1558, Nguyen Hoang’s sister, Ngoc Bao, persuaded her husband, Trinh Kiem, to
appoint Nguyen Hoang as governor of Thuan Hoa, which encompassed the
modern provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien. He departed with
his maternal uncle and mentor Nguyen U Di, along with a large entourage of
family members and retainers and made his headquarters near the modern town
of Quang Tri, thus initiating the fortunes of his family in the south. In fact, Trinh
Kiem’s appointment of Nguyen Hoang to Thuan Hoa was an obvious solution to
the perplexity of what to do with him. He was the leader of the Nguyen family,
which still held the loyalty of many people in Thanh Hoa. Furthermore, Mac
agents were becoming increasingly active along the southern coast and the
Nguyen entourage would assist to keep that frontier in the Le camp.
During the following decade the fortunes of war shifted from side to side as
Trinh Kiem and Mac Kinh Dien repeatedly met in battle. For a few years, Trinh
Kiem kept the Mac on the defensive with extended raids that penetrated into
nearly every part of the Mac territories, in both the uplands and the plains. This
prompted the Mac to build a long defensive rampart west of Dong Kinh in1560
to block the points at which Le forces were issuing from the mountains. In1561,
Mac Kinh Dien campaigned for six months in Thanh Hoa with some success. In
1562, Trinh Kiem occupied the southern part of the Red River plain for three
months to collect the rice harvest; during that time he built a fortress in Ung Hoa
district about forty kilometers south of Dong Kinh to shield his activities. He
continued to campaign each year in this region. By1565 he had built up such a
position of strength there that Mac Kinh Dien decided to avoid direct battle and
instead embarked an army and attacked into Thanh Hoa by sea, winning a major
victory over Le forces in Hau Loc district and forcing Trinh Kiem to return to
Thanh Hoa, after which the Mac army re-embarked and returned to Dong Kinh.
For three more years, Trinh Kiem continued to conduct annual raids into the

lower Red River plain, but he was growing ill and weak and during his final two
campaigns had to be carried in a litter.
With news of Trinh Kiem’s failing health, Nguyen Hoang traveled from Thuan
Hoa in1569 to pay his respects and to renew the anti-Mac alliance. According to
surviving accounts, the two brothers-in-law enjoyed an amicable reunion. Before
returning south in early1570, Nguyen Hoang obtained an additional appoint-
ment as governor of Quang Nam, thereby giving him authority over all the
southern territories. Within days of Nguyen Hoang’s departure from Thanh
Hoa, Trinh Kiem died. Several years of tumult within the Trinh family ensued.
Before his death, Trinh Kiem announced that his eldest son Trinh Coi would
be leader in his stead. However, Trinh Coi had a reputation for wine and women,
for excessive pride, and for lack of personal discipline. Within a few weeks of
Trinh Kiem’s death, many of his prominent followers abandoned Trinh Coi and
instead gathered around Trinh Kiem’s second son, Trinh Tung. Within three
months of their father’s death, the brothers were at war with each other. Mac
Kinh Dien quickly took advantage of this by advancing his armies into Thanh
Hoa. Trinh Coi surrendered to him while Trinh Tung resisted. Mac Kinh Dien
took possession of the Thanh Hoa lowlands while Trinh Tung defended the
uplands and harassed the Mac with nighttime raids. Amidst the fighting, much of
the lowland population fled to the hills, no harvest was taken, famine spread,
and many starved to death. At the end of the year, after eight months of
campaigning, Mac Kinh Dien withdrew from Thanh Hoa for lack of food.
In 1571, Mac Kinh Dien advanced to Nghe An. During the previous year, Mac
agents had recruited and organized an army in Thuan Hoa and the Mac were
aiming to recover the southern frontier from which to build a second battlefront
against Thanh Hoa. However, Nguyen Hoang defeated the Mac forces in Thuan
Hoa and Trinh Tung forced Mac armies to withdraw from Nghe An. During this
year of fighting in Thuan Hoa and Nghe An, Trinh Tung tried to resettle the
refugee population of Thanh Hoa back into the lowlands but failed to obtain a
rice crop, so Thanh Hoa endured a second year of famine.
In 1572, Mac Kinh Dien again marched through Thanh Hoa and advanced
into Nghe An. At the same time, a Mac army arrived in Thuan Hoa by sea and
rallied many of the people there. Trinh Tung met the Mac invasion with scorched
earth and sent an army to Nghe An. There was no harvest in Nghe An. Famine
and an epidemic carried away over half the population, and large numbers of
survivors fled from the province. Nguyen Hoang defeated the Mac army in
Thuan Hoa, and Mac Kinh Dien withdrew back to the north.
Meanwhile, resistance to Trinh Tung formed among members of the Le royal
family led by a prince named Le Cap De. Near the end of the year, after the
military campaigns had subsided, Trinh Tung seized and killed Le Cap De. This

prompted the king, Le Duy Bang, to flee to Nghe An with his four eldest sons.
Trinh Tung then raised Le Duy Bang’s fifth son, Le Duy Dam, to the throne. In
1573, Le Duy Bang was captured and killed and a Mac attack on Thanh Hoa
was repulsed. Trinh Tung remained preoccupied with rivals, however, and in
1574he suppressed a group of dissidents within the Trinh family. In that year he
also sent an army to repulse Mac forces that had arrived in Nghe An by sea.
Beginning in1575 and continuing for seven years, the Mac conducted annual
invasions of Thanh Hoa. Mac Kinh Dien led the first five of these, until his death
in1580. After the death of King Mac Phuc Hai in1546, Mac Kinh Dien had led
Mac armies in the field while his youngest brother Mac Don Nhung kept order at
the court of the child king Mac Phuc Nguyen. When Mac Phuc Nguyen died of
smallpox in1561 and was succeeded by his infant son Mac Mau Hop, Mac Don
Nhung continued to lead the court as regent while Mac Kinh Dien attended to
the war. During the campaigns of the1570s, Nguyen Binh Khiem’s former
student Nguyen Quyen emerged as Mac Kinh Dien’s most able lieutenant. In
those years, Nguyen Quyen typically invaded Nghe An while Mac Kinh Dien
invaded Thanh Hoa. This was the apex of Mac military fortunes. Mac armies
dominated the lowlands of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An during the fighting seasons.
Those provinces suffered endemic famine, and Trinh Tung was constantly on the
defensive. Nevertheless, in major battles when Mac Kinh Dien endeavored to
destroy Trinh Tung, he was invariably defeated and forced to withdraw. Nguyen
Quyen achieved some battlefield successes in Nghe An during these years, and
this contributed to his reputation as a great general.
The Le restoration
After Mac Kinh Dien’s death in 1580, the Mac military position steadily
weakened. Trinh Tung’s decisive defeat of the1581 Mac invasion of Thanh
Hoa was a turning point after which he gradually shifted from defense to offense.
The last Mac effort to invade Thanh Hoa was repulsed in1583. In that year,
Trinh Tung made his first raid into the Red River plain, in Ninh Binh Province to
collect rice, and the Mac general opposing him defected to the Le. Thereafter, the
populations of Nghe An and Thanh Hoa lived in peace and slowly restored a
more regular existence.
In these years Mac Mau Hop came of age and his faltering influence was
increasingly felt at the Mac court. He was an unlucky man with little evidence of
talent for government. He had been struck by lightning in1578 and temporarily
paralyzed, and in1581 he had suffered from a brief spell of blindness. In1582 he
built a pleasure palace that was no sooner completed than it burned down. He

repeatedly moved in and out of the capital, spending much time at the Mac
family estate in Co Trai, far from the battlefields. There is a story that in1585 he
heard that Nguyen Binh Khiem was on his deathbed and sent someone to ask the
dying sage for advice. Nguyen Binh Khiem reportedly foretold the fading for-
tunes of the Mac dynasty by indicating that the Mac family would be able to find
refuge for a few generations in the upland valley of Cao Bang on the Ming
border. Whether this message was thought to have given Mac Mau Hop fear or
comfort is not recorded, but his subsequent actions were erratic and self-
destructive.
Trinh Tung conducted regular raids and patrols in Ninh Binh Province,
immediately north of the Thanh Hoa border in the southwestern corner of the
Red River plain. He lacked water transport, so he looked for a way to gain access
to Dong Kinh from the mountains without having to cross major rivers. In1585
he led a large reconnaissance force through the mountains to enter the lowlands
northwest of Dong Kinh in the region of the modern city of Son Tay. This route
was difficult and impractical. He thereafter concentrated his attention on north-
ern Ninh Binh Province in the districts of Nho Quan and Gia Vien. From there he
could ascend the Boi River to Lac Thuy district, Hoa Binh Province, and pass
northward through the uplands to emerge into the Red River plain about forty
kilometers southwest of Dong Kinh at My Duc district, Ha Tay Province. He was
inactive in1586 because of massive floods, drought, then unseasonable rains,
and, finally, a palace fire that brought death to his mother. In1587, however, he
marched his men along the route to Dong Kinh via My Duc district. He defeated
a Mac army that mobilized to block his way into the lowlands and gathered
plunder before returning to Thanh Hoa. In1588, he raided through Ninh Binh
amidst drought, crop failure, and famine. The famine continued into1589 and
people scattered in search of food.
In that year, Mac Don Nhung, Mac Kinh Dien’s youngest brother, who had
overseen the Mac court since the late1540s, concentrated his dynasty’s resources
for an invasion of Thanh Hoa. He led a huge Mac army to the border where, in
the Battle of Tam Diep, it was ambushed and dispersed by Trinh Tung. Trinh
Tung counted over one thousand Mac dead. He captured some six hundred Mac
soldiers whom he fed and released, now confident that the Mac family was in
decline. The year1590 was quiet as both sides rebuilt their armies and prepared
for the next battle.
In 1591, Trinh Tung mobilized a great host and marched from Tay Do to
northern Ninh Binh then north through Lac Thuy district. However, rather than
emerge into the lowlands at My Duc district as he had done in1587,h e
continued through the uplands, cutting his way through the wilderness for over
ten days, to debouch from the mountains directly west of, and only twenty

kilometers away from, Dong Kinh. Mac Mau Hop personally accompanied the
Mac armies as they concentrated against the invaders. In a climactic battle three
days before the lunar new year of1592, the Mac were defeated and fell back.
Trinh Tung’s armies surged forward to envelop Dong Kinh. On the sixth day of
the new lunar year, Trinh Tung took the capital after very bitter fighting during
which the renowned Mac general Nguyen Quyen was captured and left to die in
prison. Mac survivors fled to the north bank of the Red River where Mac Mau
Hop relocated his court at Bo De.
Lacking any means for crossing the river, Trinh Tung occupied himself during
the next several months with extending his control over localities near the capital
and with building floating bridges for crossing the river. During this lull in the
fighting both sides held capital examinations in accordance with the academic
calendar. The Mac at Bo De graduated seventeen men and the Le at Tay Do
graduated three. The regular working of these exams despite the disruptions of
war shows that the educational and administrative system established a century
earlier had become ingrained in public life.
At this time, Mac Mau Hop’s capacity for folly was fully revealed. His queen
was a daughter of Nguyen Quyen. She had a younger sister named Nguyen Thi
Nien who was the wife of Bui Van Khue, one of the few remaining senior Mac
generals. Bui Van Khue had been prominent in many battles and he had fought
stubbornly in defense of Dong Kinh. Nguyen Thi Nien sometimes visited her
sister in the royal palace. Mac Mau Hop became so enchanted with her that he
plotted to kill Bui Van Khue in order to have her. When Nguyen Thi Nien
learned of this, she informed her husband. They withdrew with their retainers
to Bui Van Khue’s home estates near Hoa Lu in Ninh Binh Province. Bui Van
Khue sent word to Tay Do that he wished to submit to the Le. There followed a
series of battles in which Mac forces endeavored to prevent his submission to the
Le and Le forces sought to render him aid. During the course of these battles, Bui
Van Khue gained possession of large numbers of Mac boats, which gave Trinh
Tung the capability of crossing the Red River. Many Mac generals and officials
submitted to the Le as Trinh Tung crossed to the north bank. Mac Mau Hop fled
while abdicating in favor of his son Mac Toan, but both he and his son were
captured and killed.
Trinh Tung pursued the retreating Mac armies into the eastern part of the
plain. Mac Kinh Chi, the eldest son of Mac Kinh Dien, rallied Mac forces at the
strategic site of Chi Linh and began to push back. He constructed a rampart
along the Thai Binh River, which flows through the modern city of Hai Duong.
After weeks of fruitless efforts to break through the Mac defenses, Trinh Tung
withdrew to Dong Kinh at the end of the year to organize reinforcements. A few
weeks later, early in1593, he returned to the offensive, broke through the Mac

lines, captured Mac Kinh Chi along with ten Mac nobles, and beheaded them all.
Fifty-four Mac officials were taken into custody and brought back to Dong Kinh.
Two months later, Mac Kinh Cung, the seventh son of Mac Kinh Dien, rallied
surviving Mac soldiers and people from all parts of the Red River plain and
proclaimed himself king. He briefly established his headquarters at Bo De before
Trinh Tung crossed the river on floating bridges and pushed back his followers.
It became clear that most of the people in the Red River plain remained loyal to
the Mac and were prepared to assist them. Trinh Tung could pacify the western
edge of the plain on the right bank of the river, but Mac followers were busy
building defensive walls to protect the east. Hoping to change the political
atmosphere, Trinh Tung brought King Le Duy Dam from Thanh Hoa and
enthroned him at the battle-ravaged capital in a newly built palace. The restor-
ation of the Le dynasty was proclaimed, but the Mac were far from subdued.
It was at this time that the far southern provinces of Thuan Hoa and Quang
Nam added their full weight to the contest as Nguyen Hoang arrived with ships,
soldiers, elephants, horses, cannon, rice, and treasure. After leading his entou-
rage south in1558, Nguyen Hoang established a reputation for maintaining
well-disciplined and up-to-date military forces while governing with a light hand,
encouraging agriculture, sericulture, commerce, and a level of private wealth
significantly higher than was possible in the north. The international port at Hoi
An attracted Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese merchants. Rice was plentiful.
Sugar and silk were exported for manufactured goods from Japan, including
ceramics, utensils, weapons, and armor. Hoi An was a convenient port of call for
the Portuguese between Malacca and Macau; European artillery and musketry
were quickly mastered. A discernible contrast between northern poverty and
southern prosperity became fixed in Vietnamese regional perceptions. Conse-
quently, the theme of northern tax collectors arriving with their demands even-
tually became a focus for southern resentment.
In addition to his relative wealth, Nguyen Hoang had the benefit of a new kind
of Vietnamese population in the south, people who had learned to rely on their
own resources and initiative to a degree not possible in the north. For several
generations this had already been a place of exiled criminals, fugitives, refugees,
adventurers, and pioneers, and of Chams acculturating to Vietnamese ways of
life. The land was rich and productive. Nguyen Hoang obtained a generous
portion of the surplus without being oppressive. The relative freedom enjoyed
by the civil population was protected by the strict regime he designed for his
soldiers under the command of trusted lieutenants in his close-knit entourage.
Any challenge to his authority was quickly subdued. But beyond that he inter-
fered very little in the lives of the people he ruled so long as they tendered him
sufficient revenue and conscripts.

While Trinh Kiem regarded Nguyen Hoang with equanimity, Trinh Tung was
less secure. In the early1570s, amidst Mac invasions and struggles with rivals
both in his own family and in the Le royal family, Trinh Tung viewed Nguyen
Hoang with mistrust. There is evidence that he secretly encouraged Mac parti-
sans in Thuan Hoa to attack Nguyen Hoang. Nguyen Hoang never gave any
public indication of knowing about this. He benefited from the art of dissembling
learned from his maternal uncle Nguyen U Di. The moment of anxiety passed as
Trinh Tung established himself and both he and Nguyen Hoang accepted the
need for a working relationship.
The year1586 was a troubled year for Trinh Tung with floods, drought, and
hunger in Thanh Hoa that led to cancellation of the examination scheduled for
that year and precluded any military operations; furthermore, his mother,
Nguyen Hoang’s sister, died in a Tay Do fire. Whether it was his needy circum-
stances or the removal of his mother’s restraining hand or both, Trinh Tung for
the first time sent an“inspector general” to investigate the tax base and to collect
revenue in Nguyen Hoang’s jurisdiction. Nguyen Hoang ignored the implication
that he had been neglecting his administrative duties and warmly welcomed the
official. There was no system for registering fields and wealth in the south
comparable to what was standard practice in the north, so Nguyen Hoang
persuaded Trinh Tung’s tax collector that it was unnecessary to calculate the
amount due but that he would simply pay a negotiated amount. The amount he
was willing to pay was generous enough that the official was satisfied, and they
parted amicably. Thereafter, as Trinh Tung pressed his attacks into the Red
River plain he was sustained by annual contributions of treasure from Nguyen
Hoang.
When Trinh Tung announced the restoration of the Le dynasty in Dong Kinh
in early summer of1593, Nguyen Hoang arrived to pay his respects to the king,
but also to bring his military assets to bear upon the conquest of the Red River
plain. He went directly into battle, applying his cannon to demolish Mac defen-
sive walls and providing the breakthrough that led to a series of successful battles
that pushed Mac Kinh Cung out of the lowlands and into the northern border
province of Lang Son. For the next two years, major battles continued not only in
the mountains of Lang Son and of Thai Nguyen but also in many parts of the
lowlands, particularly in the east and south where loyalty to the Mac remained
strong.
During these years the Red River plain suffered from famine during which it is
recorded that one-third of the people in the eastern plain perished. In early1596,
a large Mac army emerged from the mountains into the eastern plain but was
defeated and Mac leaders withdrew to the northern border valley of Cao Bang.
The famine continued for a third year in1596 and annalists recorded that more

than half the people in the plain died. Uprisings subsided but great disorder
prevailed with armed bands of desperate people roving at will, burning, looting,
and killing. According to the annalist, large bands numbered from three to four
thousand and small bands numbered from seven to eight hundred.
Ming border officials reported on the uproar and, in1596, the Ming court sent
a committee to investigate. Mac officers told the Ming that the Le family had
died out and that the Trinh had usurped power. A large delegation that included
King Le Duy Dam, Nguyen Hoang, and Phung Khac Khoan traveled from Dong
Kinh to the border and argued the case for the Le. The Ming court was fully
occupied with the Japanese invasion of Korea and had no intention of getting
involved in the situation. Nevertheless, whatever it did would have an effect
either to confirm or to deny the relationship it already had with the Mac. Ming
officials were not prepared to make a decision to change the status quo, so they
temporized, sending the Le delegation away with hopes for further talks while
accepting tribute from the Mac in exchange for confirming their version of
events.
In early1597, the Mac ambushed a Le delegation on its way to the border and
seized the gold and silver it was bearing as tribute. Shortly after this, the Ming,
seeking to maintain a show of impartiality, sent an envoy to Dong Kinh and
invited the Le to attend a conference at the border. Once again, the king, Nguyen
Hoang, and Phung Khac Khoan went to meet with the Ming officials, which
resulted in Phung Khac Khoan being invited to go to the Ming capital to make
the Le case at the imperial court. His erudition and poetic prowess were reported
to have made a favorable impression on the emperor, but at the end of1598 he
arrived back at Dong Kinh in disappointment, for the emperor decided that for
the time being he would grant equal recognition to both the Mac and the Le. This
allowed Ming to enjoy the competition between Mac and Le tribute offerings
while continuing to avoid any final decision. Many Ming border officials were
sympathetic with the Mac, with whom they had long-standing relations. The
Ming dynasty was already in the early stages of decline and collapse, but its dual
recognition of the Vietnamese rivals helped the Mac to survive in Cao Bang for
another seventy years.
Meanwhile, crops continued to fail in1597, 1598, and 1599, with endemic
famine amidst continued unrest and uprisings in the Red River plain. In1597,
Mac partisans set fires in the capital and an army of Mac supporters gained
temporary control of the eastern plain until scattered in battle. In1598, several
Le armies pushed into the mountains but could not penetrate the Mac stronghold
in Cao Bang. Trinh Tung’s soldiers were getting old and efforts were made
during these years to recruit new soldiers in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An to fill
vacant ranks and to allow veterans to retire.

Despite continued hostilities with Mac partisans, those fighting under the Le
banner were gradually gaining control of the Red River plain, and Trinh Tung
was looking into the future. In1599, he received a princely title that raised his
status above all others at court save the king. When the king died soon after,
Trinh Tung set aside the crown prince, considering him to be“without intelli-
gence,” and raised to the throne a younger prince named Le Duy Tan, for whom
he became the regent. Trinh Tung thereby ensured his continued domination of
the Le court.
A remaining question for Trinh Tung was what to do about his uncle Nguyen
Hoang and about government in the far southern territories. He wanted to keep
Nguyen Hoang close at hand under his surveillance and to gain more direct
control over the south. Nguyen Hoang, however, was looking for a way to
return south without provoking a confrontation with his nephew. He had arrived
from the south several years before in the heat of battle and the excitement of the
Le restoration. Now, with the Trinh solidly entrenched at Dong Kinh, his family
had no scope for its ambitions except in the south. But lacking royal assent,
which he understood would never be given, he could not return south without
putting himself in a state of rebellion. He was75 years old. Trinh Tung appar-
ently hoped that in time the Nguyen family could be destroyed after Nguyen
Hoang’s death. Meanwhile, Nguyen Hoang resided with his men in an encamp-
ment outside the capital near the river where his boats were kept. He had been
assigned a fief there, and Trinh Tung claimed to covet his counsel in governing
the country.
At mid summer in1600 three of Trinh Tung’s generals, who were stationed
with their troops along the lower Red River south of Dong Kinh, rebelled.
Nguyen Hoang requested permission to attack them, which was readily granted.
Burning his encampment, he embarked with his men, passed through the rebels,
gained the coast, and returned to Thuan Hoa. Trinh historians believed that
Nguyen Hoang instigated the rebellion as a cover for his departure. There is no
direct evidence for this, but he is likely to have been in communication with the
rebels, for they commanded the exact route he needed to depart from the Red
River plain. Their complicity in his escape may not have arisen from his instiga-
tion. They may have believed that assisting him to return to the south would earn
them an ally in that quarter. The uprising of these generals was a more general
signal for Mac partisans to rise up in the east and for Mac Kinh Cung to emerge
from the mountains. Mac forces converged on the capital. Trinh Trang sent men
in pursuit of Nguyen Hoang, but when he saw that Nguyen Hoang had eluded
him, he hastened to Tay Do with the king in fear that Nguyen Hoang intended to
seize Thanh Hoa. Mac Kinh Cung entered Dong Kinh. Seeing that Nguyen
Hoang had disappeared into the south, Trinh Tung mobilized soldiers from

Thanh Hoa and marched back to Dong Kinh. After several months of fighting,
he defeated the Mac armies and Mac Dinh Cung withdrew back into the
mountains.
Nguyen Hoang did everything he could to make it easy for his nephew to let
him go in peace. He left behind a son and a grandson as pledges of his loyalty and
explained that he had hastened south to ensure the security of the frontier. Trinh
Tung sent a letter to Nguyen Hoang complaining of his behavior and demanding
the payment of taxes. In reply, Nguyen Hoang proposed a covenant of peace and
sent a daughter to marry Trinh Tung’s son Trinh Trang, thereby renewing the
family connection for another generation. Neither of these men wanted war with
the other. Trinh Tung was still occupied with the Mac and Nguyen Hoang
needed time to organize his domain before his death. A quarter-century later,
their sons would bring the family quarrel to the battlefield.
The events of the sixteenth century reveal that no resolution of differences
between Thanh Hoa and the Red River plain was possible without war. There
was no negotiation and no reconciliation. The matter was settled by conquest
and coercion. There were two kings in the land and, despite the circulation of
merchants and scholars and side-shifting commanders, there was no basis for
common ground. There was no center to hold the country together. There was
even a linguistic dimension to this separation. The language spoken in lowland
Nghe An today remains closer to dialects spoken in the adjacent mountains than
to standard lowland Vietnamese. In the sixteenth century, this was probably also
true of Thanh Hoa.
Educated Vietnamese later proposed the idea that sixteenth-century intellec-
tuals constituted a cultural center that affirmed a single country despite the clash
of regions and dynasties. The stories of how Trinh Kiem, Nguyen Hoang, and
Mac Mau Hop all consulted Nguyen Binh Khiem at critical moments in the
fortunes of their families have served this affirmation. Instead of being united in
loyalty to one king, the Vietnamese were united in following the advice of one
sage. In the absence of a king whom all were willing to serve, a sage announced
the fates of the combatants and thereby the fate of the country. The superficial
impression that Nguyen Binh Khiem was a voice from the center of a unifying
Vietnamese cultural authority ignores the fact that his advice confirmed later
generations in sundered realms.
According to one popular myth, Nguyen Binh Khiem and Phung Khac Khoan,
exemplars, respectively, of Mac and Le intellectuals, were half-brothers, born of
the same mother. Stories about Nguyen Binh Khiem’s mother emphasize her
ambition to give birth to a king and her chagrin at not marrying Mac Dang
Dung. A clairvoyant, she reportedly abandoned Nguyen Binh Khiem in his
childhood after realizing that he would not be a king. Vietnamese still savor

the improbable idea that she became the mother of Phung Khac Khoan. This
provides a common mother, albeit attenuated, for the realms of Mac and Le. As
noted in previous chapters, the potency of one’s mother’s family was a theme
entrenched in Vietnamese political thought for centuries. What is more certain
than this myth is that, despite close family relationships between the Trinh and
the Nguyen, when Nguyen Hoang sped down the coast in1600, his men
mending their cracking oars with silken cords to outrun their Trinh pursuers,
he was inaugurating an age of separation that would last for two centuries.

6 THE FIFTY YEARS WAR
The north
For seven weeks in late1618 and early 1619, sky gazers around the world
watched what came to be called“ the great comet of1618.” Europeans called
it “ the angry star” because of the remarkable length and reddish hue of its tail
and because it was visible even during daylight. Astronomers, astrologers, and
doomsayers in all parts of Europe wrote about it, whether as an interesting
natural phenomenon or as a portent of calamity. The comet prompted such a
degree of popular fear and agitation that King James I of England penned a poem
to remind his subjects that, although it may well be a divine sign, there is no way
to know what it means, for human thought cannot penetrate the purpose of God.
Vietnamese also watched this comet, and the recorded reactions to it in the two
Vietnamese realms show that northerners and southerners were on different
paths of historical experience. Southerners may have felt wonderment, if not
fear, as they viewed the comet but made no recorded connection between it and
public affairs; they simply noted it as a celestial event. Men in the north,
however, viewed it as the climax of a series of heavenly warnings that public
affairs were in disorder.
Celestial phenomena had been cited as omens at dynastic courts in China and
Vietnam for centuries. Sometimes, an omen implying criticism of government
policy was written into the record by later historians to express their judgment of
events. In1618 at Dong Kinh, however, the comet brought to a climax recorded
discussions about the problems of government that had been accumulating
during the previous eight years. During that time, officials from all regions of
the northern realm addressed missives to Trinh Tung describing problems and
proposing reforms. In these years, Trinh Tung was beset with serious difficulties.
He had spent his life leading the fight against the Mac family to restore the Le
dynasty and was baffled by any problem that could not be solved with soldiers.

After Nguyen Hoang’s departure for the south in1600, Trinh Tung continued
to encounter resistance, sometimes passive and sometimes active, from the popu-
lation of the Red River plain. This was encouraged by the continuing Mac threat
based in the mountain valley of Cao Bang. For two years, the outbreak of
warfare accompanying Nguyen Hoang’s departure kept Trinh Tung fully occu-
pied with battling his enemies. When Trinh Tung had hastened with the king to
Thanh Hoa in fear that Nguyen Hoang was planning to seize that province, Mac
Kinh Cung emerged from the northern mountains, rallied wide support in the
lowlands, and gained possession of Dong Kinh. Within a month, Trinh Tung had
expelled the Mac from the capital and from most territories west of the Red
River, but his armies were unsuccessful in penetrating beyond the river to the east
and south until the following year when Mac Kinh Cung was dislodged from his
family’s home region near modern Hai Phong and pressed back into the moun-
tains. Not until autumn of1601 did Trinh Tung consider the capital sufficiently
safe to bring the king back from Tay Do.
With a disaffected and potentially rebellious population in the Red River plain
and an active enemy based nearby in the mountains, Trinh Tung relied upon
soldiers recruited in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An to enforce his authority. This was
in effect a military occupation of the Red River plain by men from the southern
provinces, but the burden of heavy military conscription in Thanh Hoa and Nghe
An provoked distress and unrest even there. Furthermore, the bounty in men and
treasure that Nguyen Hoang had provided from the far south during the1590s
was no longer available. Trinh Tung was paralyzed by the magnitude of his
problems. Meanwhile, as the years passed, the question of his successor came to
the fore but resisted resolution.
In 1610, Trinh Tung was61 years old. In that year, he received two urgent
recommendations from Le Bat Tu (1563–1627), a senior official from Thanh
Hoa, the Trinh homeland, who had gained literary distinction in the1598
examination. First, Trinh Tung must name a successor to take command of the
military and to stabilize the loyalty of the people in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An.
And second, he must destroy the Mac and Nguyen separatists who held the
northern and southern borderlands. Le Bat Tu argued that the military was
presently in excellent condition with experienced officers, well-trained men,
thousands of boats, and hundreds of elephants. However, it was doing nothing
but maintaining the security of the capital, enabling rebels to nurture their
strength in remote places. He foresaw that continued inaction would wear away
the readiness of the soldiers and lead to trouble in the future, and he cited
historical precedents from the Tang dynasty for emphasis.
That Trinh Tung’s heir was still undesignated in1610 shows that this was a
complicated matter. Trinh Tung had nineteen sons. His eldest son died young.

His second son, Trinh Trang, was already34 years old, had held the rank of
grand duke since 1598, and had accumulated years of experience leading
soldiers. However, his third son, Trinh Xuan (d.1623), also had ambitions,
was virtually the same age as Trinh Trang (1576–1657), also a grand duke, and
moreover had allies in the Le royal family as well as in the Trinh family. Trinh
Tung could not find a way to resolve the issue. Within two years of Le Bat Tu’s
advice, he indicated his preference by conferring the position of “ grand
teacher” (thai pho) on Trinh Trang and the lesser position of“ grand protector”
(thai bao) on Trinh Xuan. But this did not put an end to intrigue and uncer-
tainty. The competition between the brothers and their followers could not be
dispelled.
As for military operations, the insecurity of the regime immobilized the thou-
sands of soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An who were stationed in the
capital and in other administrative centers. Nearly all the martial energy of the
Trinh was absorbed in simply maintaining control of the large but disaffected
population of the Red River plain. Not until1613 was an army, commanded by
Trinh Trang, sent to secure the mountainous eastern coastal province bordering
Ming China. The emphasis upon military occupation and control enabled cor-
ruption and abuse, and it hindered civil officials from developing what they
regarded as normal administration.
In 1612, Pham Tran (b.1567, a graduate of the Mac exam of1592 who then
shifted to serve the Le) and Nguyen Duy Thi (1572–1652, a graduate of1598),
both officials in the Censorate and both from the Red River plain, addressed a
long memorandum to Trinh Tung describing how the population was oppressed
and impoverished by corruption. After an introductory passage affirming that
rulers must care for the people and nurture their happiness, they observed that
“the righteous will” of the ruler was not being followed by“ those who imple-
ment policy,” who “ are diligent only in being heartless and cruel and in compet-
ing to live in luxury.” According to the memorandum:
Those in charge of a district bring misery to the people of that district,
and those in charge of a village bring misery to the people of that village.
They harass the people in every possible way, neglecting no method of
oppression, which is why the sons and daughters of our country lack
clothing, why there are no feasts with singing, why poverty makes
wedding ceremonies impossible, why the living are nowhere nurtured
and the dying are nowhere comforted. The means for obtaining daily
food and the necessities of life are lacking everywhere. The poor and
lowly are like bugs in the grass, unable to live like human beings.
The two authors of the memorandum believed that this pitiful situation was the
cause of natural disasters indicating heaven’s judgment against bad government:

Because of these conditions, Heaven and Earth are affected and reveal to
us that the will of Heaven above is not in agreement with our human
affairs, for the calamity of successive floods exceeding what is normal is
certainly related to current government affairs. How can we not be afraid
and mend our ways considering that these woes in the natural world are a
result of crimes among human beings?
Apparently acting in response to a perception of the problem analyzed in this
memorandum, in the following year Trinh Tung sent officials out to all jurisdic-
tions to investigate“ the misery of the people.” He also cancelled corvée obliga-
tions during three years so that debtors who were wandering about could go
home and make their living. This measure implies that excessive requisitioning of
labor was driving peasants off their land. Peasants were being forced to sell or to
mortgage their land to pay their taxes or to meet living expenses when taken
from field work to provide public labor, apparently for the soldiers whose
garrisons functioned as local government authority.
In 1615, an elderly official from the Red River plain named Nguyen Le (1543–
1619, a graduate of the Mac exam of1568 who shifted to serve the Le), then serving
as Minister of Justice, submitted to Trinh Tung a list of eight“ evil practices” that
required reform. Trinh Tung praised and rewarded him for this initiative, butno
record has survived of what the eight items were or of what, if anything, Trinh Tung
did in response to them. Up until this point, voices calling for reform came from men
of the Red River plain, presumably reflecting the effects of the military regime
imposed on that region. In the following year, Trinh Tung received a report about
troubles affecting his ability to maintain the strength of his armies.
In late autumn of1616, a procedure to conscript soldiers from Thanh Hoa
provoked a memorandum from two high officials, both from Thanh Hoa: Le Bat
Tu and Luu Dinh Chat (b.1566, a graduate of the1607 exam). They reminded
Trinh Tung that,“ for the past five or six years, during the season for growing
crops, there has been drought and the farmers have lost hope. This year, as rice
ripened for the autumn harvest, again there was a great drought everywhere,
making two droughts in one year. With disaster coming again and again, the
villagers are resentful.” Le Bat Tu and Luu Dinh Chat then deliver the punch line
that was becoming a common refrain in these years:“ Surely this is related to
current government affairs.” Such criticism of public policy, even from men
representing the home recruiting grounds of the Trinh, reveals how widespread
the perception of misgovernment had grown. The two officials recommended
that the round of conscription in Thanh Hoa be cancelled. Trinh Tung’s reaction
to this memorandum is not known.
In 1617 there were unseasonable storms and floods. Insects infested fields near
the mountains that had escaped the floods, and the autumn harvest was lost.

Early in1618, Trinh Tung roused himself to action in the way he knew best, by
sending soldiers against his enemies. He dispatched armies into the northern
mountains against the Mac, led jointly by his two sons, Trinh Trang and Trinh
Xuan. The Mac avoided large battles and fighting continued inconclusively for
several weeks until an epidemic swept the Trinh camps as the summer rains
began. There was a great loss of men and horses, and the brothers returned in
disarray. There followed a series of signs and wonders. An avalanche was
reported on Mount Dong Co in Thanh Hoa where the mountain spirit resided
in whose name the Trinh performed their annual oath of loyalty. Two odd stars
were observed in the night sky. Then there was successively a yellow rain, a black
rain, and a rain that tasted like sweet wine. Finally, the comet appeared, stimu-
lating a rush of memoranda expressing consternation.
The first missive was from three officials who came from all parts of the Trinh
realm. Pham Tran, who had co-authored the memorandum of1612, was from the
Red River plain. Le Bat Tu, who had submitted recommendations in1610 and had
co-authored the memorandum of1616, was from Thanh Hoa. Ngo Tri Hoa
(1565–1626, a graduate of the1592 Le exam) was from Nghe An. These men
noted the strange happenings of the previous months followed by the comet’s
appearance and concluded that all these unusual events“ are surely related to
current government affairs.” They itemized a list of reforms that included restrain-
ing bullies, forbidding petty harassment of the people, forbidding luxurious living,
and suppressing thieves and bandits. Also on the list was“ to practice virtue in
order to beseech Heaven’s mandate,” a remarkable proposal implying that the
regime had either lost or was in danger of losing its legitimacy to rule.
This was followed by an appeal to Trinh Tung from Luu Dinh Chat, the other
co-author of the1616 memorandum about conscription in Thanh Hoa. There
were apparently those who claimed that the various celestial signs were auspi-
cious, for Luu Dinh Chat argued against this. He wrote that although the black
and yellow rains were definitely bad omens, some avoided saying so and instead
claimed that they were signs of good luck:
Heaven has surely displayed admonitions but we have failed to wake up.
So, now for weeks we see this comet in the southeastern sky. Everyone
can see it and everyone is afraid. Truly this is not an insignificant sign.
Does not our lack of virtue display shortcomings sufficient to provoke
such a sign? Government policies are not implemented as in times past.
Orders and instructions from those wielding power are not in accord with
benevolence but are busy with cruelty and evil, scraping away the
people’s livelihood. The sound of the people sighing and groaning is
enough to move Heaven to warn us with this unusual omen. Those
who rule, seeing this, must examine themselves. I humbly request that

Heaven’s rebuke be taken to heart, that the powerless people be given
love and care, that whatever harms and hinders their welfare be elimin-
ated, and that sound policies be adopted toward them.
Luu Dinh Chat pointedly concluded:“ The generals must be ordered to stop their
brazen appropriation of the country’s wealth so that the source of the country’s
strength can be renewed.” This was not a new analysis. But Trinh Tung was in an
impossible position. He relied on his generals to maintain his power while being
given to understand that their depredations were ruining the country. He made
no recorded response to this appeal.
Discussion then spread to senior officials more generally.“ Court officials”
submitted a memorial to the king that recited the signs and wonders, the
desperate condition of the country, and the need for reform. It was recorded
that the king made no reply. Finally,“ court officials” addressed to Trinh Tung a
long itemization of abusive government practices that explicitly placed the blame
on the subordination of civil administration to military domination and even
implied that treasonous conspiracies were afoot:
When we see strange signs appear successively like this, is it not certain
that those in authority have yet to mend their virtue, that there is disorder
in government affairs, that there are those who are scheming with evil
intent?... evil men go in and out of the inner palaces inciting turmoil...
illegal appointments are made... tax collectors compete in their oppressive
exactions ... false charges are made to imprison people and to seize their
possessions... men are illegally conscripted and military duty is excessively
harsh ... Dynastic laws and regulations exist from past times decreeing that
generals are to supervise only soldiers and not civilians, but now military
officers specialize in supervising the people, taking their possessions,
killing them, seizing them to be soldiers, and using them as their personal
servants... taking taxes at exorbitant rates... they scheme with local
officials to investigate and litigate... they set up unlawful customs stations
on roads and waterways. We beg a proclamation to the generals to urgently
command them to stop this behavior. As for those who secretly have evil
intentions, they are conspirators outside of the law.
The mention of conspiracy was not without substance.
As if punctuating the outpouring of anxious criticism provoked by the comet, fire
destroyed an entire district of the capital at the beginning of the1619 lunar year. But
the accumulation of tensions within the regime was fully revealed when late in the
spring of that year an attempt was made on Trinh Tung’s life. He was ambushed as
he returned to his palace from watching a boat race on the river. At a crossroads,
someone shot a firearm at him. His parasol bearer fell, but he was unharmed. The
would-be assassin was quickly captured and identified as a retainer of Trinh Xuan.

Further investigation revealed that Le Duy Tan, the31-year-old king, had plotted
with Trinh Xuan to kill Trinh Tung. The king hoped to remove Trinh Tung’s
suffocating hand from his royal aspirations, while Trinh Xuan hopedto remove
the benefit of his father’s favor from his fraternal rival, Trinh Trang.
The man who fired the shot was executed. The king was forced to commit
suicide and was replaced with his12-year-old son, Le Duy Ky, a grandson of
Trinh Tung. Unwilling to order the execution of his own son, Trinh Tung
imprisoned Trinh Xuan, but later allowed him to be released. Trinh Xuan had
influential allies.
Trinh Tung was70 years old in1619. He lived for another four years, but he
increasingly relinquished authority into the hands Trinh Trang. Meanwhile,
Trinh Xuan endeavored to keep the succession question alive and assembled a
large armed following. As Trinh Tung lay dying in1623, Trinh Xuan led his men
into the capital, chased away the palace guards, and took possession of his barely
conscious father. He sent Trinh Tung, carried in a hammock, to his headquarters
outside of the city as his men looted the capital of its valuables and set it afire.
Trinh Tung’s younger full brother, Trinh Do, had been a prominent and active
member of Trinh Tung’s entourage. Hearing of what Trinh Xuan had done,
Trinh Do saw an opportunity for himself. He sent his son, Trinh Khai, to
intercept those carrying Trinh Tung and to bring his dying brother to his own
house. His plan was apparently to separately summon the disputing brothers in
the name of their father and put them to death, thus opening a path to power for
his own son. Trinh Khai met with Trinh Xuan and persuaded him that Trinh
Tung wanted to confer highest authority upon him. Trinh Xuan carelessly
walked into the trap and was killed. Trinh Trang, however, was warned by an
official, and he instead secured the young king, summoned all the men loyal to
him, and set out for Thanh Hoa, understanding the logic of the regime that
whoever controlled Thanh Hoa would prevail.
Trinh Do and his son were hastening, with Trinh Tung being carried along, in
pursuit of some now obscure errand on the southwestern edge of the capital
when the old man died. They abandoned the corpse beside the road. A eunuch
picked it up and hastened with it by boat to join Trinh Trang, who gave his
father a proper burial. Realizing his folly, Trinh Do hastened with his son to
make peace with Trinh Trang, who forgave them.
As Trinh Trang concentrated his forces in Thanh Hoa, Mac Kinh Cung’s
nephew, Mac Kinh Khoan, emerged from the mountains, rallied thousands of
recruits from throughout the Red River plain, and marched on Dong Kinh,
camping just across the river at Bo De and making common cause with the
group of nobles and officials who had supported Trinh Xuan. But within a
month Trinh Trang had defeated his enemies. Mac Kinh Khoan’s daughter led

a valiant but suicidal rearguard attack to enable her father to make his escape back
to Cao Bang. Two years later, Trinh Trang sent one of his sons to invade the Mac
territory. Mac Kinh Cung was captured and killed. Mac Kinh Khoan begged to
submit, was forgiven, and assigned to govern Cao Bang. After another two years,
Trinh Trang was ready to lead his soldiers against the Nguyen in the south.
Trinh Trang became known for opening the way for an era of civil adminis-
tration and relative prosperity in the villages. Many educated men trusted him.
The official who warned him against Trinh Do was Luu Dinh Chat, a co-author
of the1616 appeal to cancel conscription in Thanh Hoa and the author of the
1618 argument against military interference in local government. Amidst the
uncertainties of the events provoked by his brother’s attempt to kidnap his dying
father, Trinh Trang was advised by Nguyen Danh The (1572–1645, a graduate
of 1595), who was from a locality near Dong Kinh. Trinh Trang’s ideas about
government were influenced by the agendas for reform that had accumulated in
the time of the comet.
Some of the agrarian distress due to natural calamities recorded in the early
seventeenth century may plausibly be attributed to what has been called“ the
little ice age,” an era of relatively colder weather whose effects were especially felt
in the early seventeenth century, a time when even the River Thames froze in
winter giving Londoners the pleasure of annual“ frost fairs” on the ice. However,
misgovernment due to military rule was a salient factor in writings from that
time. The situation was further aggravated by the prolonged stalemate between
Trinh Trang and Trinh Xuan that prevented resolution of the leadership ques-
tion. Trinh Tung’s great achievement had been to restore the Le dynasty to Dong
Kinh, but in his later years, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of his life, he
was irresolute and incapable of surmounting the contradiction of having restored
a dynasty over a population in which loyalty to another dynasty remained
strong. This contradiction could be dispelled only with the passing of time.
The south
In contrast, Trinh Tung’s uncle, Nguyen Hoang, spent his last years enjoying the
adventure of building a new realm. Descriptions of his return to the south in
1600after an absence of eight years abound with celebrations and expressions of
joy. During the remaining thirteen years of his life, he traveled, he built temples,
he expanded his border southward, he received streams of emigrants fleeing
famine in the north, and he established the rudiments of government.
In 1601, during the course of his travels, he was particularly taken with a hill
on the Perfume River that runs through the modern city of Hue, which did not

yet exist at that time. The hill looked to him like the head of a dragon turning to look
back at its mother in the mountains. He enjoyed sitting at the top of the hill and
viewing the scenery, but he was dismayed to discover a sandy trench that had been
dug along one side of it. When he inquired about this, local people told a story about
the ninth-century Tang general Gao Pian who had brought an end to the violence of
the Nan Zhao War in the860s. Gao Pian was famous for excavating places that,
according to geomantic ideas, were likely to give rise to a king, thereby“ cutting the
dragon vein” that could nurture sovereignty. Geomancers believed that supernat-
ural currents of energy flowed as if in veins through the earth from the Tibetan
highlands down to the sea. Dragons symbolized sovereign power, so these currents
were called“ dragon veins.” If one rearranged the terrain to“ cut” the “ dragon
vein,” then this flow of power would drain away and be lost. Rulers were careful to
cut the dragon veins in their realm to ensure that no rival king would arise.
According to one story, the rise of the Ly dynasty was possible because a Buddhist
monk had restored the terrain and built a temple at a place where Gao Pian had cut a
dragon vein, the place that became Ly Cong Uan’s birthplace.
According to the tale reportedly given to Nguyen Hoang in1601, the sandy
trench had been dug by Gao Pian to cut the“ dragon vein” that gave this place
the potency to nurture a new kingdom. It is unlikely that Gao Pian ever traveled
so far south, but possibly at some time in the past a general leading soldiers from
the north against Chams had performed the geomantic surgery, inspired by the
same thinking that had motivated Gao Pian. Gao Pian was thought to have
introduced the study of terrain and geomancy into the Vietnamese lands, and
many books of geography among the Vietnamese were attributed to him. Stories
about him cutting“ dragon veins” and about how a clever monk had repaired
one of his geomantic excavations to enable the appearance of the Ly dynasty
were well known among Vietnamese.
After hearing the story about the hill on the Perfume River, Nguyen Hoang
was reportedly visited in a dream by a goddess who prophesied that a great lord
would come and build a temple at this place and that consequently a new and
enduring kingdom would be established. The name of the goddess was Thien
Mu, meaning“ heavenly mother.” Nguyen Hoang accordingly built a temple on
the hill, probably on the ruins of an earlier Cham temple. It was ostensibly
“Buddhist,” following a common practice of domesticating spirits by placing
them under the Buddha’s authority. The temple was rebuilt many times through
the centuries. It still remains today as the Thien Mu Temple at Hue. Its distinctive
tower was built in the mid nineteenth century by a king who was an eleventh-
generation descendent of Nguyen Hoang.
At this time, Nguyen Hoang’s headquarters were at Ai Tu, on the Quang Tri
River around fifty kilometers northwest of the Perfume River; the basin of the

Perfume River was a major place of settlement that often held Nguyen Hoang’s
attention. In 1602, near the coast in modern Phu Vang district, where the
Perfume River ends, he built a temple on the ruins of a previous temple and
named it Sung Hoa. This became a thriving center of culture for several
generations.
Also in 1602, Nguyen Hoang made his first visit to Quang Nam. He was
reportedly exhilarated by the view down the coast southward from Hai Van
Pass. He built a headquarters for governing his southern territories at modern
Dien Ban, which commanded the waterways connecting the Bay of Da Nang
with the Thu Bon River. The port of Hoi An lay near the mouth of the Thu Bon
River, and it was already a lively entrepôt attracting Chinese, Japanese, and
Portuguese merchants. Nguyen Hoang built a storehouse and a Buddhist temple
at Dien Ban and assigned his sixth son and designated heir, Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen, to be in command there.
On his1602 trip to Quang Nam, Nguyen Hoang also met with Tran Duc Hoa
(dates of birth and death are unknown; he was active c.1600–1630), who was in
command of the southern frontier in modern Binh Dinh Province. Tran Duc
Hoa’s father had served there before him, and the family had kept watch over the
southern border during the years that Nguyen Hoang had been in the north.
Tran Duc Hoa had a reputation for being well educated, an astute governor, a
keen discerner of character, and utterly loyal to the Nguyen. When, a few years
later, an ambitious and erudite man from Thanh Hoa named Dao Duy Tu
decided to seek his fortune in the south, he entered the service of Tran Duc
Hoa as the first step in what became an illustrious career in government.
Nguyen Hoang continued to take an interest in his southern territories. In1604
he organized local administrative districts in Quang Nam, and in1607 he build a
Buddhist temple at the old Cham capital of Tra Kieu. In1611, news of border
problems with Chams prompted him to send an army to seize control of the basin
of the Da Rang River in modern Phu Yen Province and to organize local adminis-
tration for settlers there, thereby advancing the border southward from Cu Mong
Pass to Ca Pass.
In 1608, a large influx of refugees from famine in the north arrived. They were
likely settled in the basin of the Nhat Le River in modern Quang Binh Province, for
in the following year Nguyen Hoang built a Buddhist temple there, at Le Thuy.
Nguyen Hoang’s final years were serene in comparison with those of his
nephew Trinh Tung. When he died in1613 at the age of88, his 51-year-old
sixth son, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, assumed authority without incident and was
the first to distinguish the family surname as Nguyen Phuc, thereby setting the
ruling lineage apart from other prominent families in the south with the Nguyen
surname.

In his youth, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen had already shown himself to be a daring
and able leader. In1585, at the age of22, he had earned the praise of his father
by taking ten war boats out to sea and sinking two of five large pirate ships
commanded by a Japanese who had been ravaging the coasts. When Nguyen
Hoang went north in1592, he had taken with him the three of his five elder sons
then still living, leaving Nguyen Phuc Nguyen to keep watch over the south in his
absence. When Nguyen Hoang returned to the south eight years later, none of his
sons returned with him, two having died in battle and one having been left with
Trinh Tung as a pledge of good faith. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen was seasoned with
many years of experience in command by the time of his father’s death.
During the years that officials were complaining of misgovernment and human
distress in the north, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen was occupied with improvising a
relatively simple yet versatile system of government for a land of diverse locales
and peoples. He also nurtured an international seaport that attracted trade from
many lands. His eldest son and heir, Nguyen Phuc Ky (d.1632), was sent to
govern at Dien Ban in Quang Nam. Portuguese ships on the route connecting
Goa, Malacca, Macau, and Japan regularly arrived for commerce at the nearby
port of Hoi An, where settled communities of Chinese and Japanese merchants
already existed. Hoi An became known as a well-regulated port with reasonable
duties, easy relations with local people, and where goods were available from
Japan, China, Cambodia, Siam, the islands of Southeast Asia, and the local
region. Jesuits based at Macau established the first Christian mission among
Vietnamese in Quang Nam in1615, and in1618 they opened a second mission in
modern Binh Dinh Province. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen held to a policy of good
relations with foreigners, understanding that trade generated wealth. He was
also careful to maintain trust with the Portuguese because this facilitated access
to European military technology, particularly artillery and musketry.
Nguyen Phuc Nguyen did not have the dilemma of civil versus military control
of government that agitated scholars in the north. Nor did he have the bitter
legacy of civil war with one region having conquered another that aggravated
this dilemma for Trinh Tung. Village governance in the north, and particularly in
the Red River plain, had been decisively affected by the reforms in civil
administration implemented during the reign of Le Tu Thanh over a century
before and subsequently strengthened by Mac Dang Dung and his successors.
The1618 memoranda submitted to Trinh Tung referred to this in terms of
“ dynastic laws and regulations” that had been established in the past, according
to which military officers had authority over soldiers only and not over the
civilian population. This principle of keeping military and civilian authority
separate had been superseded by the violence and contradictions in political
loyalties that characterized the Le restoration in the Red River plain.

Le Tu Thanh’s mode of civil government never extended to the southern
frontier. There, Vietnamese speakers developed a form of social and political life
that was closely related to the maintenance of garrisons, and the Nguyen Phuc
family relied upon the military chain of command to provide the basic structure
of their government. All able-bodied men were expected to be soldiers. The
populations in the major areas of settlement were mobilized to produce taxes
and conscripts for the military. There was no officially recognized civilian
population. Instead, all loyal subjects were“ military people.” Farmers were also
soldiers who trained and could be called to duty at any time. Craftsmen of all
kinds were simply soldiers with specialized occupations. Relatively few men were
members of full-time military units, stationed on the frontiers or at naval bases
along the coasts, and even these were required to be married, to live with their
wives and children, and to be involved at least part-time in some economic
endeavor. The exceptions to this were the élite units serving full-time as the
palace guard.
The Nguyen Phuc rulers were most immediately concerned with the region in
which the central government was located, from the northern border at the
Gianh River to Hai Van Pass. This region was known as Thuan Hoa (the modern
provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien). Aside from the basin of
the Gianh River, which remained a battleground for decades, there were three
main river basins that could support agriculture. The largest was the furthest
south, the basin of the Perfume River where the modern city of Hue is located.
Just north of this was the basin of the Quang Tri and Ben Hai Rivers. The
Nguyen Phuc headquarters was located here until1626, when it was moved
further south into the basin of the Perfume River as the Trinh wars began.
Between this place and the Gianh River was the basin of the Nhat Le River,
where the modern city of Dong Hoi is located. This was the strategic“ choke
point” between the mountains and the sea where major battles between the Trinh
and Nguyen would be fought. Much of the attention of the Nguyen Phuc leaders
in the first half of the seventeenth century was aimed at building up a large, well-
organized population in Thuan Hoa as a bulwark against northern invasions.
To the south, beyond Hai Van Pass, Quang Nam, with the port of Hoi An,
with abundant rice fields and with mines of gold and other metals, was a
secondary focus of attention as a nearby source of manpower and wealth. The
two regions of Thuan Hoa and Quang Nam, often referred to as Thuan-Quang,
made up the heartland of the realm. Regions further south were mostly left to the
vicissitudes of local officers so long as border security was maintained and
surplus resources in cash, commodities, and manpower were produced by way
of taxation and conscription. Although initially all territories south of Thuan
Hoa were considered as part of Quang Nam, the jurisdictions that became the

modern provinces of Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen gradually developed
their own administrative identities as settlements of Vietnamese speakers grew.
Binh Dinh, with the modern city of Qui Nhon, was the most important of these
because it had been the southernmost garrison on the Cham border already for a
century and a half, because of its good seaport, and because it was the terminus
of a trade route going west through the uplands to the Mekong River and
beyond.
The term used to designate administrative centers was initially the word for
“ garrison” (dinh, a southern vernacular pronunciation of doanh, a Sino-
Vietnamese word for“ garrison” ). The meaning of this word expanded in the
south to mean a military headquarters, a place of government authority, and,
combined with the word for“ first” or “ primary” (chinh), the capital or site of
the ruler’s residence (chinh dinh). These etymological shifts reflected changes in
the practice of government as Nguyen Hoang organized a land of frontier
garrisons into a separate country.
In 1614, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen established four offices with administrative
responsibilities that reveal a garrison model of government to rule the country.
Three of these, the so-called“ three offices” (tam ty), were concerned with public
governance, while one of them served the extended household of the ruling
family. Two of the“ three offices” were charged with collecting taxes and
organizing the transport and distribution of supplies and provisions to military
units. The Office of the Guard (Lenh Su Ty) was concerned with units on duty in
the capital and in the districts nearest to it. The Office of the Garrisons (Tuong
Than Lai Ty) was responsible for supply to military units stationed in the
provinces. A third office, the Office of the Commissioners (Xa Sai Ty), was
responsible for administering courts of justice among populations where litiga-
tion was not subject to martial law. The fourth office, of the Inner Court (Noi
Lenh Su Ty), was established to serve the ruling family and the highest levels of
its entourage by supplying tax revenue and commodities from throughout the
realm.
These offices operated in four jurisdictions that overlapped geographically but
served four different classes of people. In the capital district, local administration
was entirely in the hands of the Office of the Guard. There were no civil courts of
law because the capital district was essentially a garrison under military disci-
pline. In districts further from the capital, throughout Thuan Hoa and at stra-
tegic points further south, the Office of the Guard continued to be responsible for
military units while the Office of Commissioners staffed courts of law for people
not inside the system of military command. The Office of the Garrisons was
responsible for military affairs outside of the places under control of the Guard,
and it ensured supplies and trained conscripts for the Guard. The Office of

Commissioners was more prominent in areas more distant from the capital,
where non-military and non-Vietnamese people constituted more of the popula-
tion. The Office of the Inner Court went everywhere to collect goods and
provisions directly for the ruler, his family, and his favorites.
In 1615, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen began to organize his lands into prefectures
and districts. Local magistrates were assisted by clerks who investigated and kept
records about residents, by officials in charge of education, and by ritual experts
who conducted ceremonies and sacrifices at temples and shrines. While magis-
trates collected fees for village festivals and other miscellaneous local expenses,
officials from the offices of the central government collected the head tax in cash
and the field tax in rice. This was different from taxation in the north, which
relied upon village officials to collect taxes.
In the north, taxation was such an onerous subject of contention and negoti-
ation between villages and higher authorities that finally, in the1660s, the system
was simplified so that villages were communally subject to a fixed and unchan-
ging rate, which, by the early eighteenth century, created an entirely new set of
problems. In the south, however, taxpayers paid directly to the central govern-
ment, not to village authorities, and their assessments were subject to triennial
re-evaluations based on their property, age, health, social status, and other
criteria, such as the part of the country in which they resided. Thus, the southern
tax system was much more sensitive to the actual circumstances of the popula-
tion than was the case in the north.
To some extent this reflects the fact that local populations in the south were
constantly changing as people moved about and settled in new areas. This
complicated the ownership of land with disputes involving local officials and
individual residents. Consequently, in1618, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen sent officials
to survey and register the ownership of fields throughout the land, aiming to put
an end to litigation over land ownership and to establish the basis for collecting
field taxes.
A year earlier, in1617, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen opened a bureau in the Office of
the Inner Court to supervise gold, silver, and iron mines; to collect customs duties
on merchant boats from Guangdong, Fujian, and Japan; and to control com-
modities of trade such as fragrant oils, honey, beeswax, elephant tusks, rattan
mats, lacquer and lacquer paintings, aromatic wood, caulking resin, and wire of
brass and steel. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen paid close attention to markets and trade.
One of the features of situating the central government in the basin of the Quang
Tri River was that it was at the eastern terminus of a well-worn route west along
the Cam Lo River through the mountains to the Mekong River where the
modern Lao town of Savannakhet is located; this became colonial route9 along
which major battles were fought during the period 1968–1971. When Lao

bandits were making the route unsafe for merchants in1621, Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen’s response was to collaborate with a group of merchants to lure the
bandits into an ambush. In the following year, a garrison was established on this
route to provide security for trade.
During the first quarter of the seventeenth century, the Trinh and Nguyen
domains moved in different directions. While the Trinh were constricted with
insoluble problems in the north, the Nguyen found themselves in a world of
expanding possibilities. The Jesuit missionaries who arrived at this time per-
ceived two hostile countries. They called the northern country Tonkin and the
southern country Cochinchina, according to the usage of the Portuguese on
whose ships they sailed. Tonkin was the European pronunciation of the northern
capital, Dong Kinh, but Cochinchina derived from the wider world of maritime
commerce.
The Portuguese obtained the term Cochinchina from the Malays, who had
picked it up from the Arabs, who apparently coined the name in the early
fifteenth century when Ming fleets sailed to India, Arabia, and Africa. At that
time, the Ming used the ancient term Giao Chi for Vietnam, pronouncedJiaozhi
in Mandarin Chinese andKawci in Arabic. The Arabs used the termKawci min
Cin (Kawci of China) to indicate that this was a place near China. In Malay,min
was absorbed into a nasalization of the second syllable ofKawci. When they
received the name from the Malays, the Portuguese considered that the name
Cochinchina was meant to distinguish this place from the Cochin that they knew
on the western coast of India. What is probably most significant about this rather
tortuous etymological path is that, although in the early fifteenth century the
term initially appeared in reference to the north, which is where the Vietnamese
were at that time, the Vietnamese place known by this name to the maritime
world in the early seventeenth century was in the south. While northern rulers
never learned the benefits to be derived from encouraging foreign trade, the
southern rulers instinctively understood and wholeheartedly welcomed it.
For the Trinh who ruled the north, the Nguyen south was simply a rebellious
province governed by a family of renegades. It could have no name separate from
or equivalent to the realm of the Le dynasty. On the other hand, the terminology
by which southerners distinguished between the north and the south eventually
affected the vocabulary of all Vietnamese speakers. During the Le–Mac wars of
the sixteenth century, Le partisans referred to themselves as those on the
“inside,” thereby indicating that they were in the center of authority with the
legitimate king. By contrast, they referred to the Mac as being on the“ outside,”
meaning in a state of rebellion. While this terminology was not continued in the
north after the Le restoration, it shifted to a new context among those who went
south with Nguyen Hoang. Southerners called their land the“ Inside” (Dang

Trong) and the north they called the“ Outside” (Dang Ngoai), for they con-
sidered that the Trinh were in a state of rebellion since they held the Le kings as
virtual prisoners.
Nguyen Khoa Chiem (1659–1736), a southerner writing in the early eight-
eenth century about events a century earlier, recorded a poem that he claimed
circulated after Trinh Tung had killed King Le Duy Tan in1619. The poem
assumes that Trinh Xuan had plotted to kill his father because he wanted to
restore supreme authority to the king; yet it also suggests that Trinh Xuan’s
parricidal scheme is evidence that his family, a family of usurpers, is doomed.
The poem reflects a southern perspective on the events in Dong Kinh:
Pity the sad fate of the Le King;
In evil times, men see omens and portents.
Few brave men help the royal court,
But many hands give aid to usurpation.
If Trinh Xuan had planned for certain success
The king would not have had to regret.
As for that son and father seeking to destroy each other:
It is clear that Heaven’s favor has abandoned the Trinh family.
The poet’s voice is from the “ inside,” professing allegiance to the king. It
condemns the Trinh as “ outside” of Heaven’s favor because the Trinh have
usurped royal authority. This ostensibly virtuous attitude was cheap in the south,
where no Le king existed to interfere, even theoretically, with the ambitions of
the Nguyen Phuc family.
The terminology of the south being“ inside” and the north being“ outside”
was eventually generalized to all Vietnamese when southerners took over the
whole country at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Today, when speaking
of traveling in their narrowly vertical country, Vietnamese say they are going
“into the south” (vao nam) and“ out to the north” (ra bac), rhetorical vestiges of
the two hundred years during which Vietnamese inhabited two countries.
War begins
During the1620s the sons of Trinh Tung and Nguyen Hoang commenced a war
that continued for fifty years and ended in stalemate. The exigencies of this war
led to fundamental changes in both the north and the south, with the Trinh
regime expanding its base of support to include the people of the Red River plain
and the Nguyen regime expanding the reach of its armies into the Mekong region
to become involved in Cambodian affairs. Also, during the first half of the

seventeenth century, Europeans joined Chinese and Japanese as important par-
ticipants in foreign trade, and Jesuits introduced a new religion from Europe that
was accepted by many thousands of Vietnamese in both the south and the north.
Trinh Trang’s resolution of the succession crisis at Dong Kinh in1623 and his
relatively successful invasion of Cao Bang to subdue the Mac in1625 produced a
sense of momentum that led naturally to an invasion of the south. Trinh Trang’s
eagerness to extend his hand into the south was demonstrated already in1620,
after his father’s failing health opened opportunities for him to exercise greater
authority. In that year he conspired with two sons of Nguyen Hoang, Nguyen
Hiep and Nguyen Trach, to overthrow their elder brother, Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen. Trinh Trang sent one of his younger brothers with a small army of
5,000 men to the border to divert Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s attention, enabling
Nguyen Hiep and Nguyen Trach to mobilize their forces. Nguyen Tuyen, a son
of Nguyen Hoang’s deceased eldest son, who was Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s most
able commander, learned of the plot and took precautions. When the rebellious
brothers fortified Ai Tu, where Nguyen Hoang had resided from1558 to 1570,
Nguyen Tuyen attacked and captured them. They died in prison, and the Trinh
army returned north without battle.
Trinh Trang was married to a daughter of Nguyen Hoang named Nguyen
Ngoc Tu (d.1631). In1623, after the succession uproar in Dong Kinh and the
deaths of Trinh Xuan and Trinh Tung, she wrote a letter to her brother Nguyen
Phuc Nguyen and entrusted it to Nguyen Cuu Kieu, a high official at the Le court
who opposed the Trinh and was resolved to flee into the south. When he arrived
in the south he told a dramatic story of being trapped at the Gianh River by
pursuing Trinh soldiers, but in answer to his prayers a water buffalo appeared
and carried him swimming across to the other side, allowing him to escape.
Nguyen Cuu Kieu became a loyal servant of the Nguyen Phuc family, served as
an able military commander, and died of battle wounds in1656 at the age of58.
He married a daughter of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen and founded the Nguyen Cuu
family, which produced talented southern generals in every generation for the
next two centuries. The letter he delivered in1623 apparently contained infor-
mation about political events in the north occasioned by the death of Trinh Tung.
The news of Trinh Tung’s death was cause for celebration in the south.
Nguyen Phuc Nguyen ordered three cannon volleys and three shouts of joy at
his court. One of those at court that day was Nguyen Huu Dat (1603–1681). He
was the son of a general, well educated, and had received a court appointment
while still in his teens. Already showing the irrepressible personality for which he
would be known throughout his illustrious career, he reacted to the volleys and
shouts by bursting out in a loud voice,“ What is all this for? Why don’t we take
the chance to invade the north?” Nguyen Phuc Nguyen instructed the young

man’s father to take him aside and explain to him that it would not be right to
take advantage of kinsmen in mourning.
Nguyen Phuc Nguyen realized that Trinh Trang was intent upon war. He
readied his soldiers but maintained a purely defensive posture, rejecting the
advice of generals who wanted to march north. He was determined to avoid
any gratuitous provocation, despite Trinh Trang’s rising crescendo of demands.
In 1624, he sent away Trinh Trang’s tax collectors with the excuse that harvests
had failed for several years. In1626, he moved his court further south, from the
Ai Tu area to the modern district of Huong Dien, in the northern part of the
Perfume River basin. He was64 years old and was relying increasingly upon his
younger brother Nguyen Khe (1588–1646) for attending to details. In that year,
Trinh armies began to assemble on the border and Trinh envoys arrived with a
royal edict demanding taxes and summoning Nguyen Phuc Nguyen to the Le
court. This reportedly provoked great indignation among Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen’s followers, who were eager for war. He was said to have calmed them
by saying that, although the Trinh sought to provoke hatred, he would not
trouble himself with earning ridicule by replying in kind. He sent the northern
envoys away with the message:“ Do not pursue a petty feud.” He did not
welcome war, but neither did he shrink from it when it came.
At the beginning of1627, Trinh envoys demanded that Nguyen Phuc Nguyen
send a son to the Le court with thirty bull elephants and thirty large ocean-going
ships, supposedly to bear tribute to the Ming. They also conveyed a request that
the children of Nguyen Hiep and Nguyen Trach, the deceased rebels, be sent to
stay with their aunt, the wife of Trinh Trang. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen understood
that war was now imminent. He replied that the elephants and ships were
beyond the normal tribute schedule, that all the children were busy preparing
weapons to defend the border, and, implying a threat, that his family would
come to pay their respects to the king in a few years, which would be soon
enough.
By this time, Trinh Trang had placed the palace women and his treasury in Tay
Do for safekeeping and was already moving south, King Le Duy Ky in tow, with
a large fleet, while the bulk of his army marched by land. He issued a long
proclamation accusing the Nguyen of rebellion and announcing his punitive
expedition against them. The Jesuit Alexandre de Rhodes (1593–1660) observed
the expedition as it went down the coast. He described an advance guard of two
hundred ships filled with soldiers followed by twenty-four large ships bearing the
headquarters staff and the royal retinue. Five hundred boats carrying provisions
brought up the rear. Three hundred elephants bearing artillery accompanied the
land force. De Rhodes estimated the total number of men in the expedition, both
on land and on sea, at two hundred thousand. Most were probably recruits from

the Red River plain with likely no more than one-quarter of the number from
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. Many men from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An would
have been left at Dong Kinh to ensure security while Trinh Trang was away in
the south.
This war among Vietnamese broke out in the context of Ming dynastic
weakness. In the early seventeenth century, the empire to the north was steadily
declining and about to collapse. Trinh Trang understood that there was no
danger of a Ming threat materializing on his northern border to take advantage
of his being preoccupied with war in the south. The significance of this is clear
from the fact that the Trinh ceased the war as soon as the nascent Qing dynasty
was firmly established later in the century.
The Trinh campaign of1627 lasted several weeks in the spring of the year.
There was heavy fighting around the mouth of the Nhat Le River both on land
and on water until a southern elephant charge somewhat pushed back the
northerners. Nguyen Huu Dat, the youth who had cried out for war in1623,
was in the midst of the southern effort, and he played on Trinh insecurities by
forging a letter that was passed to Trinh Trang implying that members of his
family were plotting against him at Dong Kinh. Trinh Trang’s nerve broke, and
he rushed back north with his army following after. This turned to his advantage
as he learned while on the way back that Mac Kinh Khoan had led his men out of
the mountains and was moving through the waters of the Red River plain with
large numbers of boats, once again rallying the people of the plain still loyal to
his family. Trinh Trang’s sudden appearance with his army marching north out
of Thanh Hoa sent Mac Kinh Khoan fleeing back to Cao Bang.
After the Trinh retreat, the governor at Qui Nhon, Tran Duc Hoa, came to
congratulate Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, to whom he introduced his son-in-law Dao
Duy Tu. Dao Duy Tu (1572–1634) became Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s most prom-
inent advisor during the next few years. His ideas about defending the south
from the north, both militarily and diplomatically, shaped the southern attitude
toward the northern threat. He was from a Thanh Hoa family of musicians and
theatrical performers but had devoted himself to study. In1625 he went to seek
his fortune in the south. Hearing of Tran Duc Hoa’s reputation, he sought and
obtained service in the entourage of this venerable and highly respected gov-
ernor. He wrote and sang vernacular poetry, which reportedly won him the
attention of Tran Duc Hoa, who gave him a daughter in marriage. Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen was quick to perceive that Dao Duy Tu was a man of unusual qualities:
erudite in both literary and military matters, wise, and utterly loyal to the
southern cause.
Dao Duy Tu was a breath of fresh air for Nguyen Phuc Nguyen. He had come
of age during the final years of fighting between the Le partisans and the Mac

during the 1590s and had watched the Trinh fight their way into power from
their stronghold of Thanh Hoa. He spent many years studying the dynastic
histories and classical literature, but he was blocked from seeking a government
career because his father was an entertainer, a profession despised by the north-
ern scholars. When he went south, he was in some sense going home, to a place
where his abilities were appreciated and to a culture of public service that valued
ability over ancestry.
Dao Duy Tu was one of the first poets to write long vernacular poems in the
“ six-eight” (luc-bat) mode, which became increasingly popular thereafter and is
commonly regarded as a typical Vietnamese form of poetry, easy to memorize
and to recite or sing because of its complicated but regular tonal and rhyme
scheme. The poem that he wrote and supposedly sang to catch the attention of
Tran Duc Hoa, and which Tran Duc Hoa passed to Nguyen Phuc Nguyen by
way of introducing him, was a“ six-eight” work in 136 lines about the third-
century general Zhuge Liang, who spent many years in study and thought before
becoming the most brilliant strategist of his generation. Zhuge Liang was prom-
inent in the battles of the“ Three Kingdoms” era that followed the collapse of the
Han dynasty in the third centuryce. Many southerners came to regard Dao Duy
Tu as a Zhuge Liang in their own time.
Dao Duy Tu is widely thought to have introduced theater into the south, and
his poetry is distinctive for its musicality, its exuberant joy in nature, and the
absence of the weary cyclicity, eremitism, veneration of the past, and preoccupa-
tion with poverty and disappointment that had come to characterize northern
poetry. He wrote a332-line “ six-eight” poem in praise of the Nguyen rulers and
can easily be considered as the first southern poet. His more immediate contri-
bution to the south, however, lay in his analysis of how to respond to the
diplomatic and military challenges from the north, for Trinh Trang was fixed
on a policy of quelling the south to complete the Le dynasty restoration.
After the failure of his southern campaign and the brief reappearance of the
Mac ghost, Trinh Trang was faced with the familiar problems of natural calam-
ities, rural distress, misgovernment, and fear of treachery. There was drought
and famine in1629 and there were floods and famine in1630 when even the
capital was inundated. In1631 there were devastating storms with destructive
winds and deadly hailstones accompanied by fires and floods in the capital.
Furthermore, signs and wonders accumulated from year to year. An investigation
revealed that most military commanders were corrupt and habitually abused the
people and that the worst of this was in Thanh Hoa, the regime’s homeland.
Another investigation revealed that two high ministers had been playing a
profitable scheme of appointing large numbers of corrupt officials who were
seizing land in their jurisdictions and oppressing the people.

Amidst these problems, Trinh Trang endeavored to identify men he could trust
and who knew how to govern. He promoted those who had stood with him
during the crisis of1623, and he turned to the examination system to bring new
talent into government. In the capital examination of 1628, sixteen of the
eighteen passing candidates were from the Red River plain. One of them was
Pham Cong Tru (1602–1675), from the eastern part of the plain that had once
been the Mac stronghold. Pham Cong Tru became the foremost scholar and
statesman of his generation, and under his leadership a major reform of govern-
ment was implemented at mid century. This became possible because of his close
personal relationship with Trinh Trang’s son and heir, Trinh Tac (d.1682).
The date of Trinh Tac’s birth is unrecorded, but he was given the rank of grand
duke in1614, which is likely to have been conferred sometime between the ages
of 7 and 12.I n1631, he was put in command of the southern border jurisdic-
tions of Nghe An and Bo Chinh, an important assignment that showed he had
earned his father’s confidence. During the next fifty years, Trinh Tac, through
many vicissitudes, implemented changes that eventually brought men from the
Red River plain into the center of government and eased the generals from Thanh
Hoa and Nghe An out of the arena of decision-making.
Meanwhile, after1627, both sides prepared for the next campaign. Realizing
that the south was stronger than he had expected, Trinh Trang needed time to
overcome his difficulties and to assemble a larger military force. He also wanted
to strengthen his argument with his brother-in-law Nguyen Phuc Nguyen. In
1629he had a royal appointment sent to confirm Nguyen Phuc Nguyen as
governor of the southern territories while at the same time summoning him to
bring soldiers to help suppress the Mac in Cao Bang. His thinking was that in the
unlikely event that the appointment and summons were accepted and obeyed
then it would be easy to dispose of the southern leader as he came north, but if
the appointment was rejected then he would be clearly justified in pursuing the
war since the south would unambiguously be in a state of rebellion against the
king.
When the royal appointment arrived in the south, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen heard
two conflicting opinions. Men who were nervous about the accusation of rebel-
ling against the Le dynasty advised that since the appointment was from the king
there was no way it could be refused. Men who were ready to throw over the Le
monarchy countered:“ We have our own kingdom here. Why do we need this
appointment?”
Dao Duy Tu’s view was focused on practicalities. He saw that the Trinh were
trying to ensnare the southerners with a royal edict and that refusing it would
certainly elicit another invasion from the north, for which the south was not
prepared. There had been a major mobilization of men into the military during

1628, but no definite steps for defending the northern border had yet been taken.
Furthermore, a Cham invasion of Phu Yen was just then drawing attention to the
southern border. Dao Duy Tu advised to pretend to accept the appointment in
order to buy time for preparing border defenses and then find a way to return it.
This is what Nguyen Phuc Nguyen did.
The apparent acceptance of the royal appointment elicited a northern request
to forward taxes from the southern territories. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen was
inclined to meet this demand, believing that the south was so small and weak
compared with the north that the best way was simply to pay the north off. Dao
Duy Tu disagreed, reportedly saying:“ Times are changing. This land is no longer
part of the royal domain. Here you are the lord. Build walls to keep the
northerners out.”
Dao Duy Tu and southern mobilization
Dao Duy Tu traveled throughout the Nhat Le River basin to study the terrain.
The river collects water flowing from the mountains that is caught behind a large
stretch of coastal sand dunes sixty kilometers long and, on average, five kilo-
meters wide, oriented from southeast to northwest. The river flows north and
enters the sea where the dunes narrow and end. Much of the basin is swampy and
subject to inundation, but the northern third of it, where the mountain slopes are
less than ten kilometers from the coast, comprises the historic choke point that
had made this a borderland for centuries.
In 1630 and 1631, two walls were built across the northern part of the Nhat Le
River basin. One wall reached the coast at the mouth of the river. It was initially
known as“ the wall of the teacher” (Truong Thay), in reference to Dao Duy Tu. Later
generations called it the Wall of Dong Hoi, after the name of the city now located
there. A second wall was roughly parallel to the first wall and around twelve
kilometers further south. It was called the Wall of Truong Duc, which might be
translated as“the long‘heave ho’ wall,” bringing to mind that virtually the entire
able-bodied male population of the southern realm was mobilized to construct these
walls. These walls were around six meters high with cannon mounted every twelve to
twenty meters. A third line of fortifications, called the Wall of Truong Sa, or“the long
sand wall,” was built facing the sea along the crest of the dunes between the other two
walls. An iron chain was prepared for stretching across the mouth of the Nhat Le
River to block enemy ships in time of battle. Finally, the Dinh Muoi fortress was built
in the middle of the rectangle formed by the walls and the mountains.
With this system of fortifications materializing, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, taking
Dao Duy Tu’s advice, sent an envoy to the north bearing a chest containing

treasure and a hidden compartment in which was placed the royal edict and a
coded message meaning“ the appointment is not accepted.” Southern historians
recorded a long interview that the envoy supposedly had with Trinh Trang in
which he cleverly countered all the northern arguments against the south and
after which he managed to get away back to the south before the secret compart-
ment was discovered.
At this time, the death of Trinh Trang’s wife, Nguyen Ngoc Tu, daughter of
Nguyen Hoang and sister of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, removed a living link
between the Trinh and Nguyen Phuc families. She had been an active presence
in Dong Kinh society, patronizing Buddhism and building at least one temple.
The death of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s wife occurred around the same time. She
exemplified another significant family connection of that time. She was a daugh-
ter of the renowned Mac prince and general Mac Kinh Dien. After the death of
her father in1580, she had been taken as a child to the south by an uncle, Mac
Canh Huong. She was an aunt of Mac Kinh Khoan, who in the1620s and1630s
led the Mac family and who, after his brief submission to the Le court in1625,
continued to harass Trinh Trang from his stronghold in Cao Bang.
Mac Canh Huong’s service in the entourage of Nguyen Hoang from the1580s
on suggests the complexity of Nguyen Hoang’s political calculations. Nguyen
Hoang was an enemy of the Mac in his commitment to restore the Le dynasty,
but he was an ally of the Mac against the ascendance of the Trinh. A son of Mac
Canh Huong was married to a daughter of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen and had been
adopted into the Nguyen Phuc lineage with the name Nguyen Phuc Vinh. He was
a good general and led the army that successfully expelled the Cham invaders
from Phu Yen in1629. The Mac remained a worrisome but increasingly minor
threat to the Trinh until the1660s, capable of distracting raids whenever Trinh
armies marched south. However, if some kind of implicit anti-Trinh alliance
existed between the Mac and the Nguyen Phuc, conditions were never suffi-
ciently favorable to enable it to materialize.
During the course of constructing the walls, Dao Duy Tu met a young military
officer who so impressed him that he made him his son-in-law and introduced
him to Nguyen Phuc Nguyen. This young man, Nguyen Huu Tien (1601–1666),
was given an important command and became known for training his men to a
remarkably high level of skill and discipline. He became one of the two southern
generals to especially gain fame in the battles of the next thirty years. The other
general was Nguyen Huu Dat, the young man who had called for war in1623
and had participated in the battles of1627.
The emplacement of so many cannons on the Nhat Le walls as well as the
arming of ships with cannons required a large and reliable supply of artillery. In
1627, a Portuguese named Manuel Tavares Bocarro had established a gun

foundry in Macau that for the next half-century produced cannons sold in many
parts of Asia. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen purchased Bocarro cannons, but he needed
more. In1631, using methods learned from the Portuguese, a foundry for
making guns and cannons was constructed near the walls, and the people of
two villages were assigned to acquire the skills necessary for working there. One
administrator, thirteen supervisors, and eighty-six workers were assigned to
work at the foundry.
In 1632, Dao Duy Tu supervised a reform of procedures for mobilizing human
and material resources that was ostensibly based on the late fifteenth-century
model of King Le Tu Thanh, who had scheduled census registrations for taxation
and conscription at six-year intervals and literary exams at three-year intervals.
Population registers were to be kept up to date to facilitate a major military
conscription every six years and a smaller mobilization during the intermediate
third years. The country was organized into ten mobilization districts. Five of
these were in Thuan Hoa, two were in modern Quang Nam, one in Quang Ngai,
one in Binh Dinh, and one in Phu Yen. This may indicate the relative size of
populations in these regions, but it surely indicates that the Thuan Hoa popula-
tion was more militarized than those of areas further south. Three of the five
districts in Thuan Hoa were in modern Quang Binh Province, namely the Nhat
Le River basin and the territory north to the border. From this it is clear that the
strategic border region was heavily populated with military settlements and may
have provided around three-tenths of all conscripts.
Each district had a designated assembly point, and, during the years of major
mobilizations, men with education could report to these places to take a one-day,
two-part literary examination to measure ability in writing poetry and prose.
Local magistrates gave a preliminary evaluation of these exams and judges in the
Office of Commissioners decided the final results. The best candidates were
exempted for five years (until the next large mobilization) from the head tax to
allow them to continue their studies and to seek recommendations for govern-
ment service. There was also an examination simply on ability to write classical
characters, and from those who took this exam men were chosen to work as
clerks in the“ three offices.” If there were still vacancies to be filled in the“ three
offices,” they could be filled with men who contributed certain amounts of cash
or rice and who presumably were in a position to assist in securing provisions for
the military.
While some form of field tax was implemented to collect rice, this appears to
have been done according to a relatively flexible method for supplying military
units handled by the Offices of the Guard and of the Garrisons, for no specific
information about this survives. It is probable that some rice was obtained by
purchase rather than outright taxation. The main form of taxation was based

upon the regularly updated population registers and was a head tax in cash
levied on all male inhabitants. The head tax was based on the eight categories in
which people were registered: active-duty soldiers, reserve soldiers, civilians,
elderly (over50 years old), disabled, mercenaries, indigent, and deserters. The
tax rates were variable depending upon whether one was registered in Thuan
Hoa or in the jurisdictions further south and whether one was classified as
“primary,” meaning a full citizen, or as a“ guest,” which apparently meant a
relatively new settler who was still in the process of establishing a new life.
In general the head tax for“ guests” was around one-half to two-thirds the
amount levied on “ primary” taxpayers. There was no tax on indigent or
deserting “ guests,” probably indicating that such people did not exist in any
significant number if at all. It is a mystery how the tax levy recorded for deserters
was enforced, unless it was treated as a payment allowing one to be registered
out of that category. The rates for“ guests” were a bit lower in Thuan Hoa than
in the southern regions, perhaps indicating that refugees and settlers arriving
from the north were encouraged to settle there. The rates for“ primary” taxpay-
ers show minor variations for the two jurisdictions, except for mercenaries who
in the southern regions were taxed significantly higher than in Thuan Hoa and
who, while constituting only one category in Thuan Hoa, were separated into
three categories with different rates further south. This may indicate that“ mer-
cenaries” were more numerous in the south where military units were organized
comprised of Chams, uplanders, and eventually Khmers and Chinese. Soldiers,
both active duty and reserve, had the highest tax rates, indicating that, far from
being a fiscal liability, military men and their families were integrated into the
productive economy. The level of discriminating detail displayed in the head tax
schedule suggests that the authorities were concerned to ensure that the rates
were an appropriate and workable compromise between the government’s desire
to maximize revenue and the taxpayer’s ability to pay.
Within a few years, Dao Duy Tu’s initiatives had affected nearly every aspect
of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s government. He also successfully discouraged policies
of which he did not approve. For example, in1632, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen
wanted to establish government monopolies for luxury goods such as pepper,
bird nests, and other southern exotica. Such monopolies were standard in the
north. Dao Duy Tu, however, felt that this would distract government with
unnecessary opportunities for corruption and would stifle commerce that could
more profitably be taxed. He made his point by appearing in court dressed as a
merchant. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen reportedly understood his point and abandoned
the idea.
In just a few years, Dao Duy Tu’s leadership had reorganized southern military
and fiscal operations to channel human and material resources into a system of

fortifications that protected the Nguyen Phuc realm from northern attacks
during the remainder of the war. His unusual combination of abilities, unable
to be exercised in the intellectually and socially constrained north, were appreci-
ated and utilized in the south.
Trinh mobilization
In1632, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s eldest son and heir, Nguyen Phuc Ky, who had
been governing the southern territories from Dien Ban in Quang Nam since
1614, died. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, now70 years old, immediately designated
his second son, Nguyen Phuc Lan, as his heir, keeping him at his side while
sending his third son, Nguyen Anh (d.1635), to replace Nguyen Phuc Ky at Dien
Ban. Nguyen Anh coveted the family inheritance and began to plot with Trinh
Trang to coordinate an attempt to seize power with a northern invasion.
To facilitate his conspiracy, Nguyen Anh wanted to obtain command of the
border region. He won over to his side the ranking civil official there and, by
spreading false rumors, succeeded in having the prince in charge of the border
dismissed and having himself named to replace him. But he was off on an
extended hunting expedition when his father wanted to confer with him about
his new appointment. This demonstration of disrespect and indiscipline so
angered Nguyen Phuc Nguyen that he appointed another prince to the northern
border instead. Despite this setback, Nguyen Anh continued his plans, evaluating
the new commander on the border as likely to be timid in battle, which he
imagined would offer an opportunity for his plans to prevail.
In late1633, after twice sending out officials to examine the performance and
loyalty of local administrators and, when necessary, appointing new men whom
he trusted, Trinh Trang led his armies south and, for the first time, saw the walls.
He hesitated to attack until his supposed ally, Nguyen Anh, showed his hand.
However, the southern forces were vigilant and Nguyen Anh had no opportunity
to implement his plot. Trinh Trang fired his cannons giving the prearranged
signal to Nguyen Anh, but there was no response. In early1634, as Trinh Trang
paused in indecision, Nguyen Huu Dat led a southern attack that sent the Trinh
army fleeing back north.
Both countries were absorbed in their internal affairs for several years after
this. In1634, Trinh Trang was58 years old. He increasingly relied upon his son
Trinh Tac, already around40 years old. Both men were concerned to cultivate
the loyalty of people in the Red River plain where most of the human and
material resources of their realm were located. They aimed to do this by bringing
literati families who had served the Mac into the government and following their

ideas about how to govern. These families had been squeezed into poverty after
the Le restoration but had maintained a tradition of learning and were respected
by local people.
One such family was the Vu lineage, which traced its ancestry back to a ninth-
century Tang governor who had settled near the modern city of Hai Duong. Five
brothers in this family, great grandsons of a man who had risen to high position
at the Mac court in the sixteenth century, enjoyed public careers and prospered
under the patronage of Trinh Tac. One of the brothers, Vu Duy Chi, became
Trinh Tac’s closest friend and confidant. Pham Cong Tru, the scholar-official
mentioned above as a close associate of Trinh Tac and the leading literatus of his
generation, came from the same area as the Vu in the eastern plain, as did many
other literati who rose to eminence in the mid seventeenth century.
Trinh Tung had been chiefly concerned with military matters and gave little
attention to the examination system. During his time, relatively few candidates
were selected at the triennial capital exam, only enough to staff the royal court
and to attend to diplomatic relations with Ming. During the eleven examinations
during the thirty years from the Le restoration in1592 until the death of Trinh
Tung in1623, sixty-eight men had graduated.
During the next eleven examinations, held during the time Trinh Trang was in
power, there were150 graduates. Six of these eleven exams were held during
times of war, when an average of only eight men were graduated in each exam.
During the five exams held in years of peace, an average of twenty-one men were
graduated in each exam.
The six exams held during the celebrated Vinh Tho and Canh Tri reign periods
(1658–1671), which marked the ascendance of men from the Red River plain
and the apogee of Trinh Tac’s rule, saw104 men selected, despite one of these
exams, in 1667, yielding only three graduates during a time of intense conflict
among officials.
The Trinh had two constituencies during these years. One was the generals and
their associates from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An who were determined to pursue
the war against the south. Victory in the south would offer them prospects for
enrichment in a conquered land. The other constituency was the literati officials
and their allies in the Red River plain. They were in a position to mobilize the
men and wealth of their region that was necessary to continue the war, thereby
earning a place for themselves in Trinh government. Yet, they saw no long-term
benefit for themselves in continuing a war that nurtured the prerogatives and
aspirations of the Thanh Hoa and Nghe An warriors. While the warriors saw the
restoration of the Le dynasty as a purely military matter of subordinating separ-
atists, the literati understood the restoration as a process of rebuilding the kind of
government that had been established by King Le Tu Thanh in the late fifteenth
284 / A history of the Vietnamese

century. This was not simply a regional contest. Each constituency had allies in
the other camp, and Trinh Tac spent most of his life balancing the interests of the
two groups while leaning his weight toward the literati at critical times.
After the expedition to the south in1633–1634 ended in fiasco, the Trinh were
confronted with the familiar problems of drought and famine. In1638 another
effort to subdue the Mac in Cao Bang ended in defeat. It was nearly a decade
before the Trinh were in a position to attempt a new attack on the south.
Meanwhile, as a signal to men in the Red River plain that their loyalty to the
regime would be rewarded, a79-year-old man, Nguyen Thuc (1555–1637), from
the vicinity of Dong Kinh, who had graduated in the exam of1595 and had
served the regime faithfully for decades, was in1634 honored as an“ elder of the
country,” and when he died three years later he was given an especially high
posthumous title. The examinations in1637 and 1640 together selected forty-
two men, many of whom would play prominent roles in reorienting the govern-
ment during the next three decades.
The direction of this reorientation is apparent from edicts promulgated at this
time. In1635 a proclamation of twelve articles was aimed at corruption in the
judiciary. In1639, an edict restored a1503 law forbidding excessive confiscation
of property as compensation in litigation. This law specified that compensation
could be taken only from property belonging to the person at fault along with his
wife and children. If this was not enough, the law could obtain additional
compensation from the person’s parents and siblings, but the whole family
lineage or the entire village could not be held responsible for compensation. This
edict reveals a kind of judicial abuse, against which it was aimed, that had
apparently become prevalent, and it also shows a vision of returning to the
model of relatively benevolent government that had been envisioned by Le Tu
Thanh. Also in1639, another proclamation of twelve articles was published
urging officials to follow the law, to serve dutifully, and to win the affection of
the people. What in1618 had been ineffectual cries for justice by comet watchers
was now embedded in official government policy.
In 1642, Trinh Trang sent four of his sons to the four major administrative
jurisdictions of the Red River plain to wipe out bandits and to adjudicate
accumulated litigation. Assigned to each prince was a literati-official. The team
sent to the southern part of the plain containing the strategic routes linking Dong
Kinh with Thanh Hoa was Trinh Tac and Pham Cong Tru. This exercise in
bringing order and justice to the Red River plain was apparently intended to
stabilize administration while mobilizing men and material for a new expedition
into the south, which was scheduled for the following year.
Although the participation of literati in government was being encouraged and
the examination system was becoming a focus of access to public careers, the

general level of learning and erudition had greatly deteriorated since the Le
restoration in1592. The Mac had maintained an educational level comparable
to what had been achieved under Le Tu Thanh, but the Trinh, preoccupied with
war and with their entourage of warlords, gave no particular attention to
learning and simply made passive use of the examination system as a source of
the few men needed to draft edicts and maintain relations with the Ming. Some of
these men made themselves useful in other ways, for example by actively assisting
Trinh Trang in the succession struggle, although others of them were penalized
for having been too close to King Le Duy Tan or to Trinh Xuan.
There are many anecdotes recorded in the eighteenth century about the low level
of learning in the seventeenth century and of how this was demonstrated during
capital examinations. Discipline was not enforced in the examination yard so that
candidates consulted among themselves about how to respond to questions,
resulting in many identical answers. Those thought to be most erudite among the
candidates took the lead in composing answers that were copied by others but were
sometimes ludicrous with error. The examining officials often failed to recognize
mistakes and passed exams based on trivial or random considerations.
A famous example of the low level of learning at this time was the story of
Nguyen Minh Triet (1578–1672), from Chi Linh in the Red River plain, who
spent decades in study and took the exam of1631 at the age of53. His exam was
so erudite that none of the examiners could read it. Finally, it was discovered that
a woman known as Le Phi, who had once passed a Mac examination in Cao
Bang disguised as a man and was subsequently captured during the Trinh attack
on Cao Bang in1625, was able to read the exam. She was employed as a teacher
of the palace women.
One of the palace women who may have benefited from Le Phi’s learning was
a daughter of Trinh Trang named Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc. She had been married to
an uncle of King Le Duy Ky, but in1630 her father imprisoned her husband so
that she could be made Le Duy Ky’s queen. The king, whose mother had been a
daughter of Trinh Tung, was23 years old at that time. King Le Duy Ky was
known as a well-educated and intelligent man with a great devotion to
Buddhism, a particular dislike of being king, and a lack of discipline over the
kinds of people he allowed into his palace. In1643, he was able to escape his
royal tasks when allowed to raise his14-year-old son Le Duy Huu to the throne.
He is known to have traveled extensively to visit Buddhist temples. But his son
died in1649, and he was forced to return to the palace and to be king once again.
Queen Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc and the palace instructress Le Phi were both
fervent Buddhists. Both took nun’s vows in their later years, and in the1640s
Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc endowed fields and money to rebuild the But Thap Temple,
several kilometers east of Dong Kinh. These women may also have been

concerned about the problems of education in their time. A Han–Nom (Literary
Chinese–vernacular Vietnamese) dictionary entitled Chi Nam Ngoc Am
(Explanation of the South’s Pearly Sounds) was published at a Buddhist temple
in Dong Kinh, possibly in1641. Some evidence encourages the conjecture that it
was compiled under the supervision or patronage of Trinh Thi Ngoc Truc.
According to the prefaces to the dictionary, it was prepared as an aid for students
to master the literary language in order to pass the examinations. It was written
in“ six-eight” prosody making it easy to memorize. Furthermore, it paired Han
literary expressions with vernacular equivalents that were mostly written in
forms of Nom based on single Han characters used for their pronunciation
rather than in the more common compound forms of Nom that combined
elements of two Han characters to indicate meaning as well as pronunciation.
This dictionary reveals that Nom was used as a pedagogical tool for mastering
Han. The prefaces argue that complex Nom characters were too difficult for
students to learn, since their semantic elements already required mastery of Han
in order to be understood. The dictionary was meant to address the pedagogical
problem of how to provide students with an accessible form of Nom that could
be used as a step into Han. The compiler expects resistance to more simplified
forms of Nom and admonishes readers not to laugh at them, for using them will
assist students to be successful. The arguments in the prefaces of this dictionary
imply a solution to an apparent pedagogical crisis. Nom writing, which
according to some traditional thinking was simply a means of amusement for
retired scholars, was being reformed to be a more effective aid for teaching Han.
This apparently lies behind the temporary shift toward simpler forms that Nom
scholars have perceived in seventeenth-century texts. It was a response to the
decline of education after the Mac had been expelled from Dong Kinh.
In the1630s, both the Nguyen Phuc and the Trinh adjusted their policies of
domestic governance to more efficiently mobilize their populations for war.
Southerners organized to defend their northern border. In the north, people from
the Red River plain were brought into the government and used to establish a
regime of civil administration capable of mobilizing men and rice, while the
warrior clans of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An were diverted from their occupation
of the old Mac kingdom to focus on overrunning the separatists in the south.
Christianity
In1651, Alexandre de Rhodes, already mentioned in connection with Trinh
Trang’s 1627 expedition against the south, published a Vietnamese–Portuguese–
Latin dictionary in Rome. It is the first dictionary to use a Romanized

transcription of the Vietnamese language. Because of this, Alexandre de Rhodes
is commonly thought to have invented the Vietnamese alphabet, but in fact it was
initially devised by Portuguese and subsequently adopted by the Jesuits as an aid
for language learning. Alexandre de Rhodes, from Avignon in France, was one of
the early Jesuit missionaries to work among the Vietnamese. After spending a
year and a half in the south for language study, in1627 he entered the north,
where he remained for three years before being expelled. After spending a decade
in Macau, he returned to the south for five years (1640–1645) and then departed,
arriving in Rome in1649.
Alexandre de Rhodes introduced knowledge of northern Vietnam to Euro-
peans with his1651 account of the“ Kingdom of Tonkin,” published in Italian in
1650, in French in1651, and in Latin in1652. Accounts of the north by other
Jesuits followed shortly. Joseph Tissanier (1618–1688), who resided in the north
during the years1658–1663, published an account in French in1663. In the
same year, Giovanni Filippo de Marini (1608–1677), who served in the north
during 1647–1658, published an account in Italian, of which a translation into
French was published in1666. An account of the south by Christoforo Borri
(1583–1632), who lived in Binh Dinh Province from1618 to 1622, was pub-
lished in Italian in1631 and within two years had been translated into Latin,
French, English, Dutch, and German. Alexandre de Rhodes wrote an account of
the mission in the south published in French in1652. Behind these accounts were
the experiences of dozens of Jesuits who lived in the two Vietnamese realms
during the first half of the seventeenth century.
The beginning of Christianity among Vietnamese is commonly associated with
the missionaries who wrote accounts in European languages, and especially with
Alexandre de Rhodes because of his dictionary and also because of his Latin–
Vietnamese catechism published at Rome in 1658. However, the man who
probably had the greatest long-term impact on early Vietnamese Christianity
has not been much remembered outside of Vietnam. Geronimo Maiorica (1589–
1656), originally from Naples, spent four years, 1619–1623, in Goa before
proceeding to Macau. After a brief time in Makassar in1624, he arrived in
southern Vietnam about the same time as Alexandre de Rhodes and spent four
years in language study before returning to Macau in1628–1630. After a failed
attempt to establish a mission in Champa, he went to Dong Kinh in1631.I n
1632 he went to Nghe An and spent the next eighteen years in the area of the
modern city of Vinh, relatively distant from Dong Kinh and the vicissitudes of
court politics. There he nurtured one of the most successful of the early Christian
missions, which by1634 numbered twenty-six churches and over4,000 Chris-
tians. By 1647, he reported fifty-three churches with Christians from over
seventy villages. When he departed Nghe An in1650, he estimated that there

were approximately40,000 Christians in the province. From Nghe An he went
to Dong Kinh, where he resided until his death, serving as head of the mission in
the north. The Christian community that he served in Nghe An has remained to
this day.
A common misperception created by Alexandre de Rhodes’ dictionary is that
Christian missionaries used alphabetic writing in their proselytizing work. The
alphabet was used by the Jesuits to study Vietnamese and by Vietnamese catech-
ists to study Latin, and also both Europeans and Vietnamese wrote some alpha-
betic works for the education of new missionaries or for personal reasons.
However, the writings for use in the daily life of the Christian communities were
in Nom, and Geronimo Maiorica, during his years in Nghe An, produced a large
literature in Nom about saints’lives, the sacraments, biblical stories about Jesus,
practical morality, liturgical aids to worship, and devotional exercises. These
have been used through generations of Vietnamese Christians into contemporary
times.
The use of Nom by Christians is one aspect of the development of Nom in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that has received little attention by modern
scholars. But, during the last quarter of the twentieth century, dictionaries
compiled by Christians, Vu Van Kinh and Father Tran Van Kiem, have pion-
eered the development of modern Nom studies. These scholars included texts
attributed to Maiorica among the source materials for their dictionaries.
The relative success of Christian proselytizing among Vietnamese, with a Jesuit
estimate of250,000 Christians in the north alone by1655, was part of a more
general religious ferment at this time, which was also expressed in the flourishing
of Buddhism, Daoism, and spirit cults. Buddhists published many Nom texts at
temples in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries containing stories about
Buddhas and bodhisattvas, translations of sutras, and instructions for perform-
ing rituals. King Le Duy Ky and the royal family patronized Buddhist temples,
large numbers of which were built, rebuilt, or repaired in the seventeenth
century. This was also the time when spirit pantheons appeared or were elabor-
ated with hierarchies of spirits to be called on by mediums during séances. In
response, a Buddhist sect known as the“ School of the Inner Religion” special-
ized in subordinating popular spirits to the Buddha’s authority. Daoists likewise
wrote texts claiming popular spirits for their tradition. The pantheon of the
“holy mothers” appeared contemporaneous with veneration of Mary the“ holy
mother” of Jesus by Christians. It was a time of lively religious activity that was
either stimulated by the appearance of Christianity or, at least, in which Chris-
tians participated.
One the Jesuits’ assets that recommended them to Vietnamese rulers was the
mathematical and astronomical learning that some of them possessed and that

enabled them to predict eclipses and to keep calendars more accurately than local
specialists. Foreknowledge of eclipses and an accurate keeping of calendars were
an important demonstration of a ruler’s competence to govern, and European
ability in this area of expertise was appreciated. In1627, Trinh Trang was
especially pleased with the gift of a clock from Alexandre de Rhodes. Jesuits also
gained favor because of their medical knowledge and were often summoned by
rulers to attend to the sick in their palaces.
European missionaries and Vietnamese Christians suffered periodic episodesof
persecution led by local authorities or leaders of other religious traditions. Never-
theless, they mostly enjoyed the forbearance, if not the favor, of rulers during these
years because they were viewed as a means of eliciting the assistance of European
powers in the continuing struggle between north and south. In the south, relations
with the Portuguese and Macau were firmly established by the time war brokeout
in the1620s. Southerners quickly mastered Portuguese expertise in gunnery, both
in manufacture and in use, including the skill of firing cannon on ships at sea. The
Trinh turned to the enemy of the Portuguese, the Dutch.
Maritime trade
While Western accounts feature the activities of European merchants in the two
Vietnamese countries during the seventeenth century, Chinese, and for a time
Japanese, merchants were more important in the overall economy of foreign
trade for both the north and the south. Europeans joined a system of maritime
trade that had its own Asian tempo. In the early seventeenth century, a peaceful
Japan, recently unified under the Tokugawa Shogunate, drove this tempo with a
surging market for silk and large amounts of copper coins and silver specie to pay
for the silk.
At the same time, Ming China, the main source of silk, was not only in decline
but had prohibited trade with Japan. Consequently, Chinese and Japanese
merchants gathered in Vietnamese ports where Chinese silk was exchanged for
precious metals from Japan. As the Manchu conquest disordered China and the
availability of Chinese silk fell, Vietnamese silk began to enter the market and
became an increasingly large part of the trade. Large profits could be made, and
the Portuguese and Dutch endeavored to join this trade. For their part, Vietnam-
ese rulers in wartime valued trade with Europeans as a means of gaining access to
European-style cannons and muskets, which were superior to the weapons
previously available from Chinese manufacturers.
Northern and southern Vietnamese policies toward foreign merchants were
very different. In the north, foreign trade was primarily a government monopoly,

so merchants had to deal with an array of mandarins and eunuchs who imposed
duties, fees, and bribes for their own enrichment as well as that of their lords.
Furthermore, unlike Hoi An, which was near the sea at a place where sea-going
ships could anchor and which was allowed to prosper without excessive govern-
ment intervention, doing business in the north meant getting to Dong Kinh,
where the governing authorities were located, and this in itself was a complicated
task.
Ships could not ascend the main branches of the Red River because the currents
flowed too fast. Rather, they entered the plain at the Thai Binh estuary and
anchored in the Thai Binh River at a place in modern Tien Lang district. From
here, merchandise was transferred to river boats and taken upriver. At the junction
of the Thai Binh and Red Rivers lay Pho Hien, the modern town of Hung Yen.
Here a customs station controlled all traffic passing upriver. Many foreign mer-
chants resided and maintained warehouses at Pho Hien, going to Dong Kinh only
to transact business. The community of Chinese merchants was particularly large
at Pho Hien, where they even built temples. Europeans also maintained residences
here, for obtaining permission to reside permanently at Dong Kinh was a special
mark of favor by the Trinh authorities. Consequently, in order to even arrive at the
place of business in Dong Kinh, foreign merchants had to run the gauntlet of two
groups of predatory officials, one at the Thai Binh estuary and one at Pho Hien.
And once in Dong Kinh, one still had to be ready with gifts for the highest
authorities before actual business could be conducted. The Trinh authorities were
in general disdainful of merchants. This may have been partly due to a Confucian
prejudice against the merchant class, but it was more fundamentally due to a
vigilant and avaricious Trinh policy of preventing any class of people from
accumulating wealth. Foreign merchants submitted to the difficulties of doing
business in the north in the seventeenth century only because the profits to be
gained from selling Vietnamese silk in Japan were so high.
The southern rulers were more dependent upon and eager for foreign trade
than were the Trinh. The port of Hoi An was more accessible to maritime routes
than was the north, it offered a greater array of merchandise, it was basically a
free port without duties, and it was governed with a sense of order based on
market principles. Nguyen Hoang actively solicited foreign merchants. For
example, during the first decade of the seventeenth century he repeatedly sent
letters to the ruler of Japan to encourage Japanese investment in trade with his
country. He even formally adopted a Japanese envoy to give his contact with the
Japanese ruler the aura of a family relationship.
At that time, the Tokugawa Shogunate was seeking to sort out pirates from
merchants by issuing “ red seal” documents to ship masters who would then
benefit from the protection of official recognition. The“ red seal” trade was most

active during the rule of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen (1613–1635). In 1635, it was
discontinued and, thereafter, Chinese and European merchants handled most of
the trade with Japan. During the time of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, over32 percent
of all“ red seal” ships registered for Southeast Asian ports went to Hoi An, sixty
out of a total of185 ships. By comparison, only twenty-eight went to northern
Vietnam, thirty-one to Siam, thirty-one to the Philippines, twenty-four to Cam-
bodia, and one to Champa. Trade with Hoi An amounted to around one-fourth
of all Japanese foreign trade in these years.
While he did not attempt to monopolize trade, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen neverthe-
less participated in it, even marrying one of his daughters to a Japanese mer-
chant. Major exports from Hoi An to Japan were silk, sugar, pepper, rattan,
calambac, deerskins, and precious wood. Imports were ceramics, utensils,
swords, armor, silver, and copper. Much of the copper was in the form of old
coins no longer officially accepted in Japan, which arrived in large quantities
during the1620s and 1630s. Copper coins from Japan were an especially
important item of trade at that time. Those of inferior quality were melted down
to make cannon while the rest entered the cash economy. Behind the“ red seal”
ships, Chinese and European merchants also participated in the trade between
Japan and Hoi An. When the“ red seal” system was abandoned in1635 and
Japanese ships could no longer officially participate in the silk trade, the Portu-
guese and Dutch were quick to pick up the slack.
Large Chinese and Japanese communities developed at Hoi An and built up the
culture of the port with Buddhist temples and Christian churches. The early Jesuit
missionaries, who first entered the Vietnamese-speaking world at Hoi An in the
1610s, were assisted by Japanese Christians who arrived to escape persecution in
Japan or who had become part of the Jesuit organization based at Macau. Ten
kilometers upriver from Hoi An lay Dien Ban, the Nguyen Phuc headquarters for
governing their southern territories and for overseeing foreign trade.The Hoi An/
Dien Ban area and the region of Qui Nhon, the second most important seaport on
the southern coast, were the first places for Jesuits to reside, learn Vietnamese, and
begin to proselytize.
The Hoi An market was part of a relatively monetized economy by Asian
standards at that time. The significance of money in the southern economy is
reflected in the tax policy, which relied upon the head tax in cash rather than
upon the collection of rice, which was the main form of taxation in the north.
Unlike in the north, where foreign trade mainly benefited high-ranking officials
and their clients, commerce was an important part of southern life and many
people of all classes profited from it. The regime benefited from this both by
participating in it and by encouraging ordinary people to do so, not by taxing
commerce per se but by insisting that taxpayers produce cash.

One reason that a tax on rice was not an important source of tax revenue in
the south was that not very much rice was grown there. Much land was planted
with mulberry trees and sugar cane to supply silk and sugar for the Hoi An
market. Rice was imported from Cambodia to meet local needs. When the
Cambodian king forbade the export of rice in1637 because of a poor harvest,
a serious famine resulted in Thuan Hoa, forcing the government to distribute rice
from its storehouses. According to annalists, only Thuan Hoa was affected by
this, probably indicating the large military population there.
The port of Hoi An was a point of concentration for goods from the moun-
tains, the coasts, the sea, and from islands and coasts across the sea. While in the
north foreign trade affected a relatively small part of the population, in the south
many local economies, and also economies beyond the Nguyen Phuc domain,
were mobilized to support the market demand at Hoi An. The wealth generated
by this was critically important to the Nguyen Phuc, for it enabled them to buy
modern weapons needed to defend the northern border, particularly cannon,
muskets, and gunpowder. The Portuguese were prime suppliers of these items
and enjoyed a special relationship with the Nguyen government in the south
from its beginning.
When, early in the century, the Dutch sailed into Asian waters and attempted
to trade at Hoi An, Portuguese envoys from Macau demanded of local author-
ities that they be excluded. The southern Vietnamese rulers were sufficiently
solicitous of good relations with the Portuguese that they complied, though the
exclusion was not always strictly enforced if the Portuguese happened not to be
noticing. The Dutch and Portuguese were in a state of war during the first half of
the seventeenth century.
Since 1568, the Dutch had been at war with Spain in a struggle that, after
eighty years, eventually led to recognition of Dutch independence in 1648.
From 1580 to 1640, Portugal was united with Spain under the Spanish Bour-
bon monarchy and thus was an enemy of the Dutch. Furthermore, the initial
Dutch goal in going to Asia was to monopolize the Moluccan Spice Islands,
which at the beginning of the seventeenth century were held by the Portuguese.
The Dutch seized the Portuguese fort at Ambon in the Spice Islands in1605.I t
was there that in1623 they executed ten Englishmen along with one Portuguese
and nine Japanese, the so-called Amboina Massacre that poisoned Dutch–
English relations for decades but achieved for the Dutch a long-lasting domin-
ance of the Spice Island trade. In addition to these factors was that the Dutch
were Protestant Christians who, in the ongoing wars of Reformation versus
Counter-Reformation in Europe, were enemies of the Catholic Iberians. Conse-
quently, the Dutch in Asia attacked the Spanish and Portuguese at every
opportunity.

The Portuguese and Spanish had pioneered European trade with Japan, but in
1600 a Dutch ship sent to attack the Portuguese and Spanish in Asia arrived in
Japan and thereafter the Dutch became increasingly important participants in the
Japanese trade, establishing a trading station in1609 and breaking the Iberian
monopoly on European trade with Japan. In1619, the Dutch established their
Asian headquarters at Batavia, modern Jakarta, on the island of Java, located to
keep a firm grip on the Spice Islands and to take advantage of the westerly winds
along the direct route across the Indian Ocean from the southern tip of Africa to
the Sunda Strait separating the islands of Java and Sumatra, thereby avoiding the
Portuguese bases at Goa and Malacca. This route was called the“ roaring
forties” because of the strong westerly winds that blew along forty degrees
latitude. From 1624 to 1662, the Dutch maintained a strong presence on the
island of Formosa. They frequently attacked the Portuguese at Macau and at
Malacca. In1641, they finally seized Malacca.
Considering that an amicable and satisfactory relationship had already existed
between the Portuguese and the southern Vietnamese rulers before the appear-
ance of the Dutch, it is not surprising that the Vietnamese absorbed from the
Portuguese a certain suspicion and wariness toward the Dutch. The Portuguese
at Hoi An did all they could to prejudice the southern Vietnamese rulers against
the Dutch. For their part, the Dutch perceived with distaste the close relationship
between their Iberian enemy and the southern Vietnamese authorities and were
inclined toward a jaundiced view of the southern realm. The first Dutch attempt
to do business at Hoi An was in the context of potential enmity.
Dutch sailors had already been killed along the southern Vietnamese coast
when in1601 Dutch merchants arrived at Hoi An to negotiate an agreement to
open trading relations. A rumor that they were about to be ambushed provoked
the nervous Dutchmen to flee, plundering and burning a village on their way out
to sea. A second attempt to open trade relations in1613 also ended in failure
with a Dutch merchant being killed. During the next two decades, ships sent by
the Dutch to Hoi An never arrived, either because of the distraction of attacking
Portuguese shipping or because the crews refused to go there, fearful about their
safety.
In 1632, a Portuguese ship that had been seized by the Dutch drifted ashore
near Hoi An. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen sent the Dutch survivors to Batavia on a
Chinese ship with an invitation to trade at Hoi An. However, during the next
two years, Dutch efforts to trade at Hoi An were thwarted by Portuguese and
Japanese competition, and the salvageable goods from three Dutch ships
wrecked on the southern Vietnamese coast were confiscated. Dutch demands
for compensation were refused by the Vietnamese authorities, and Dutch expect-
ations of benefiting from the end of“ red seal” shipping in1635 were dashed by

the decision of the Japanese merchant community in Hoi An to do business with
the Chinese rather than with them. Subsequently, the Dutch abandoned further
attempts to do business at Hoi An, deciding to go to the north instead.
Understanding the close relationship between the Portuguese and the south-
erners and the enmity between the Portuguese and the Dutch, Trinh Trang
warmly welcomed the Dutch when they first arrived at Dong Kinh in1637.H e
permitted the Dutch to reside at the capital and lost no time in initiating discus-
sions to elicit Dutch naval participation in his next expedition against the south.
A group of Dutchmen thereafter resided at Dong Kinh. Some of them took
Vietnamese wives whose local knowledge enabled them to profit from fluctu-
ations in the supply of silk. During their first few years at Dong Kinh, the Dutch
enjoyed the fruits of Trinh Trang’s benevolence, inspired by an expectation of
Dutch military assistance against the south. The Dutch were spared the worst of
extortionate practices and happily found that the price of silk in the north was
around half the price in the south, where it was not so plentiful, allowing them to
make huge profits in Japan.
Hendrik Baron was among the early employees of the Dutch East Indies
Company assigned to reside at Dong Kinh. He learned Vietnamese and con-
tinued to work at Dong Kinh until his death in1664. His son, Samuel Baron,
born of a Vietnamese mother, grew up in Dong Kinh but was sent to Europe in
1659. In the1670s Samuel Baron returned to Asia with the English East India
Company and subsequently spent several years trading at Dong Kinh. In1685 he
wrote “ A Description of the Kingdom of Tonkin” that was eventually published
in 1732 at London. Baron’s account, reflecting conditions in the late1670s and
early 1680s, after the end of the Trinh–Nguyen wars, portrays the Trinh govern-
ment as viewing foreign merchants primarily as targets for extortion. The diffi-
culties in doing business that he describes led to the departure of all European
commercial enterprises from the north by the end of the century. The era of
European trade with the north was an aspect of the Trinh search for arms and
allies in wartime.
New leaders in an old war
After the Trinh army withdrew north in early1634, there was a change of
leadership in the south. Dao Duy Tu died later that year, and Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen died a year after that. His son, Nguyen Phuc Lan, was35 years old when
he came to power in1635. He was assisted by an uncle, Nguyen Khe, by a
cousin, Nguyen Tuyen, and by his full brother, Nguyen An, all capable and loyal
men. When Nguyen Anh, the royal brother whose schemes had failed to benefit

from the Trinh invasion of1633, openly rebelled, he was captured and killed
after a battle that left many dead. Nguyen Phuc Lan moved the site of his
government a bit further south, into what today is the northern fringe of the
modern city of Hue.
Nguyen Phuc Lan viewed the northern border with relative complacency, and
events in 1640 tended to confirm this attitude. Nguyen Khac Liet, the Trinh
commander in charge of Northern Bo Chinh, on the northern bank of the Gianh
River, which served as the border between the two realms, was apparently overly
excited by his position on the border and, some years before, had begun to play a
traitor’s game by secretly pledging allegiance to Nguyen Phuc Lan. However, his
arrogant behavior subsequently lost him the trust of both Trinh Trang and
Nguyen Phuc Lan. When his activities began to stir unrest in Southern Bo Chinh,
on the southern bank of the Gianh River, Nguyen Phuc Lan consulted with his
generals. Following the advice of Nguyen Huu Dat, a letter was sent to Trinh
Trang reporting Nguyen Khac Liet’s treachery and pretending that his offer to
serve Nguyen Phuc Lan had been refused. The idea was that if Trinh Trang sent a
force to arrest Nguyen Khac Liet, the Nguyen would call on his previous pledge
of allegiance to facilitate the movement of Nguyen forces across the river.
Whichever way he turned, Nguyen Khac Liet would be easily eliminated, either
by the southerners or by the northerners.
When a northern army approached to arrest Nguyen Khac Liet, the southern-
ers attacked across the river and sent him fleeing into its arms. He was taken
north and starved to death in prison. Meanwhile, the southerners gained control
of Northern Bo Chinh. When Trinh Trang requested the return of this territory,
Nguyen Phuc Lan agreed, having succeeded in establishing a new measure of
peace along the riverine border.
In the wake of these events, a certain noble at Nguyen Phuc Lan’s court cited the
ancient sages and Trinh perfidy to advocate a more aggressive policy towardthe
north. Nguyen Phuc Lan responded by calling the man a fawner and dismissed him.
Yet, two years later, when he decided that he wanted to attack the north, he found
that his“ boat soldiers” were not in a state of readiness, so he instituted a program of
intense training for them. As it turned out, Trinh Trang was a step ahead ofhim.
In the dry season of1643–1644, a large Trinh expedition marched and sailed
south. Trinh Tac and Pham Cong Tru led the van. Trinh Trang and the king
came with the main body of troops. The northern army brushed aside southern
forces in Southern Bo Chinh and advanced to the wall at Dong Hoi, but northern
efforts to break through the wall were repulsed. When the hot summer weather
arrived, an epidemic ravaged the northern camp and the Trinh army withdrew.
The Dutch also participated in this campaign, having arranged with Trinh Trang
to join in combined action against the south.

The hostile Dutch attitude toward the south had hardened after two of their
ships en route from Formosa to Batavia were shipwrecked on the southern
Vietnamese coast in late1641. All salvageable merchandise was confiscated
and the eighty-two survivors were detained and placed under the supervision
of the Japanese community in Hoi An.
Early the next year, the commander of a Dutch ship sailing to Batavia with a
Trinh envoy was persuaded by the envoy to stop at Da Nang Bay to seize
hostages. He seized over100 people. Then, hearing about the Dutchmen held
at Hoi An, he tried to negotiate an exchange with a local official. Thinking he
had an agreement, he released the people he had seized, but he kept the Nguyen
official and the official’s Japanese interpreter pending release of the Dutchmen.
The Vietnamese authorities then refused to release the Dutchmen until not only
the official and the interpreter were released but also the northern envoy was
handed over. Worried about rumors of approaching Vietnamese war galleys, the
Dutch weighed anchor and sailed off to Batavia.
Apparently seeking to appear conciliatory, the Nguyen Phuc authorities
allowed fifty of the Dutch hostages to board an unarmed ship and sail for
Batavia. However, the Portuguese attacked the boat at sea and all the Dutchmen
perished except for fourteen who washed up on the Cham coast where they were
enslaved. One of them escaped to Cambodia from where he made his way to
Batavia. The friendly gesture of releasing the fifty men was lost on the Dutch
authorities at Batavia, who were determined on revenge for what they considered
to be southern Vietnamese hostility toward them.
Thinking that the Trinh were planning to campaign against the southerners in
1642, in that year the Dutch sent five ships with over200 sailors and soldiers to raid
the coast and seize hostages before joining the northern army at the border. In
Quang Ngai, they burned down several hundred houses, as well as a rice granary,
and seized dozens of captives. At Cu Lao Cham, an island off the coast near Hoi An,
a Dutch foray was repulsed with heavy losses. After this, Dutch demands for the
release of their men were ignored and the Dutch killed some of their hostages before
sailing north. Discovering that there was no Trinh campaign that year, the Dutch
met with northern authorities to plan for a campaign the following year.
In early1643, five Dutch ships arrived in northern Vietnam from Formosa to
coordinate with the Trinh campaign, but the Trinh forces were not scheduled to
depart for the south until later in the year. The Dutch commander would not
wait, but agreed to leave one ship to go with the Trinh expedition, and then
departed for Batavia. Contrary winds forced back two of the Dutch ships, so
three Dutch ships were available to accompany the Trinh campaign.
Learning of this, the authorities at Batavia ordered three ships under the
command of Pieter Baeck to sail from the Straits of Malacca to the Gianh River

border on a schedule to arrive at the time of the expected campaign. Meanwhile,
the Trinh army was already encamped at the border. The three Dutch ships that
had joined the Trinh earlier in the year were in the vicinity but inactive. Pieter
Baeck was instructed to place these ships under his authority and to coordinate
with the Trinh battle plans.
Southerners at coastal watchtowers sighted Pieter Baeck’s ships as they sailed
north. Nguyen Phuc Lan’s 25-year-old son and heir, Nguyen Phuc Tan, went in
pursuit of them with sixty war galleys and engaged them in battle. The sounds of
the battle from across the water were audible in the Trinh camp. The Dutch
flagship caught fire and blew up when its powder magazine ignited. The other
two Dutch ships were heavily damaged and escaped with difficulty. Pieter Baeck
and one of the other Dutch captains were among those killed.
The Dutch briefly attempted to blockade Hoi An in1644. Various efforts were
made to mediate the release of the fourteen Dutchmen remaining in custody
there, including an initiative by Alexandre de Rhodes, who happened to be in
Hoi An at that time. However, the Dutch authorities had grown weary of their
frustrations along the southern Vietnamese coast and gave no more attention to
the matter until a brief effort at making peace was made with Nguyen Phuc Lan’s
successor in1651.
The Dutch embarrassment from their defeat in the1643 battle with the southern
Vietnamese was contemporaneous with similar misadventures in Cambodia. Their
consequent loss of prestige affected their trading operations in northern Vietnam,
where they suddenly began to suffer in unprecedented ways from the depredations
of greedy eunuchs and officials and to find that competition from Chinese mer-
chants began to squeeze their portion of the silk market. From then on, theDutch
stayed clear of any further military alliance with the Trinh.
The Trinh followed up their disappointing southern adventure of1643–1644
with an unsuccessful attack on Cao Bang led by Trinh Tac. Trinh Trang, then68
years old, was beginning to lose his health and, in1645, officially delegated
decision-making powers to Trinh Tac. Trinh Tac then established his own court
to govern the country. Two of his brothers led a rebellion against him in that year
resulting in a battle that raged through the streets of Dong Kinh and left,
according to Dutch estimates, some4,000 people dead. Trinh Tac’s rivals were
captured and killed. Pham Cong Tru emerged as Trinh Tac’s chief advisor on
non-military matters, and his Confucian education was almost immediately
apparent in edicts exhorting officials to be honest and not to oppress the people
with unlawful extortions. Another edict forbad anonymous letters that
bewitched and confused the people, suggesting that treason was finding many
forms of expression. The next few years were relatively uneventful as Trinh Tac
prepared for another propitious time to send his soldiers south.

In the south, the most salient piece of surviving information from this time is
that in1646 it was decreed that a new literary examination was to be held every
nine years. The exam was for three days and consisted of three parts: (1) writing
a type of poetic prose written in alternating four-six syllable lines; (2) writing the
phu mode of rhythmic prose; and (3) writing prose essays on the classical books.
At the same time, a system of ranks and appointments for graduates of this exam
was put in place. In1647, thirty-one men were selected as a result of the first such
exam.
The widow of Nguyen Phuc Lan’s elder brother, who had died in1631, was
known as Lady Tong. She was both beautiful and a clever conversationalist. In
1639she had gained entry to Nguyen Phuc Lan’s palace over the objections of
some of his advisors who worried about her father who had turned coat and fled
to the north. Nguyen Phuc Lan’s younger brother, Prince Trung, became
involved with her and fell into a conspiracy facilitated by her father to assist a
northern invasion. The conspiracy was uncovered and Prince Trung died in
prison. But the Trinh invasion of1648 that arose in the context of this intrigue
was the most serious test of southern defenses yet.
The Trinh broke through the first wall and took the fortress of Dinh Muoi,
which was the center of the southern defense system. The northerners were
breaking through the second wall when their offensive stalled. Truong Phuc
Phan was in command of the section of the wall that was crumbling before the
northern advance. His father had come south with Nguyen Hoang and by this
time he was an old man. His son Truong Phuc Hung stood beside him as he sat
calmly atop the wall under his parasol of authority directing the southern
defense. His confident demeanor reportedly appeared to his troops as if he were
a deity, which inspired them to greater effort. A female spy provided important
information that helped to time a southern counterattack. Nguyen Huu Dat, in
the midst of the battle, raised his eyes to the sky and observed in the clouds signs
of southern victory. Nguyen Huu Tien shifted the fortunes of battle with a
nighttime attack of one hundred bull elephants. Nguyen Phuc Lan was dying
and had given command of the armies to his heir Nguyen Phuc Tan. The
southern defenses were stretched to their limit, but they held, and the northern
armies were pushed back and forced to return north. Nguyen Phuc Lan died
within a day of reviewing his victorious troops.
Nguyen Phuc Tan was28 years old when he assumed supreme authority after
this grueling battle. His leadership during the next four decades continued the
tradition of astute rule that had been established by his predecessors. Neither he
nor his opponent in the north, Trinh Tac, was committed to a war begun by their
fathers. Both eventually understood that there was no benefit from warring upon
each other, but the forces producing the war were too strong to be halted

immediately. In both the north and the south were many men who harbored
dreams of conquest. After the fighting of1648, the nature of the war shifted.
Until then, it was a war of northern campaigns against the south. In the1650s, as
Trinh Trang slowly sank toward the grave and as challenges to Trinh Tac’s
authority continued to stir up from within the Trinh family, the south invaded
the north, moving the war into a new phase during which fundamental changes
occurred in both the north and the south that eventually led to an end of
hostilities.
During the1620s, 1630s, and1640s, the north had attacked the south as often
and with as much vigor as it was capable of doing. During the same time, the
southerners had evaluated their relative inferiority in men and resources and had
prepared defenses that were equal to the northern challenge. Despite the drama
of war, fundamental changes in society, economy, and culture were taking place
in both the north and the south that focused the north inward and the south
outward. The sheer size of the population in the Red River plain kept Trinh
attention upon the task of socializing large numbers of people to respond to
authority. Meanwhile, the southerners were awakening to the beckoning possi-
bilities of the Mekong frontier.
The far south
As described in earlier chapters, the Vietnamese had experienced centuries of
contact, both hostile and peaceful, with the Chams and related upland peoples
who spoke languages affiliated with the Malay peoples of the coasts and islands of
Southeast Asia. By the seventeenth century, there had been much mingling of
Chams and Viets along the southern coast. Although many Chams had fled further
south, into the mountains, or into the sea with each advance of Vietnamese
conquest, many others had chosen to remain, took Vietnamese names, adopted
Vietnamese habits, and over time became Vietnamese. Cham soldiers served in
Vietnamese armies and were led by Cham officers. The army sent by Nguyen
Hoang to conquer Phu Yen in1611 had been commanded by a Cham general.
For forty years after1611, the Cham population of Phu Yen continued to elicit
efforts by Cham kings to retake this rich province. Phu Yen lay in the coastal
plain of the Da Rang River, which drained a large part of the adjacent uplands
and was the last region suitable for large-scale agriculture before passing through
relatively arid, semi-desert lands on the way to the Mekong River plain. Con-
fined to a dry coastal strip, Cham leaders struggled to redefine their authority.
In 1613, the Cham king had withdrawn his capital from Phan Rang to
Phan Ri, which was futher south, possibly seeking greater distance from the

Vietnamese threat, but just as likely in response to tension between Hindu and
Muslim Chams. The Muslims appear to have been dominant at modern Nha
Trang, the last Cham seaport. In1622, a Hindu king was killed and replaced by
a Muslim king, who chased off visiting Jesuits, attacked Dutch ships, and
provoked bitter fighting between Cham Hindus and Cham Muslims. This strife
attracted the participation of neighboring upland peoples in modern Lam Dong
Province. The Churu, Ede, and Jarai were ethno-linguistically related to the
Chams and for centuries had been part of the larger political, economic, and
cultural world of the Chams. They were neither Hindu nor Muslim. Their
societies were matrilineal and matrilocal. Women initiated marriage, men joined
the families of their wives, and children inherited property through mothers.
These peoples intermarried among themselves and also with the Chams.
As the coastal Cham population declined and was increasingly limited to the
sandy lands that faced southeastward to the sea, the role of the uplanders in
Cham political life increased. In1627, a Churu chieftain known as Po Ramo
subdued both Hindu and Muslim factions and forced peace between the two
Cham communities. He was originally from Don Duong district near the modern
city of Dalat. He ruled from the Phan Rang basin and built dams and canals to
nurture agriculture in that region. He still had the seaport at Nha Trang and for a
quarter-century presided over a small surge of prosperity among the Chams. His
three principal wives were daughters of a previous king, of an Ede chieftain, and
of Nguyen Phuc Nguyen. Although for two decades his leadership went far
toward stabilizing the Cham–Viet border at Ca Pass, he could not stay clear of
continuing tensions between the Cham and Vietnamese communities in Phu Yen.
In 1651, Po Ramo was wounded in Phu Yen during an outbreak of hostilities
between Chams and Viets. He died of his wounds. Po Nraup, one of his half-
brothers, a son of his Churu mother and a Cham father, took authority and went
on the offensive, attacking Phu Yen and driving Vietnamese soldiers and officials
out of that province.
Nguyen Phuc Tan sent an army of three thousand men under the command of
a Cham general known as Hung Loc. Hung Loc not only retook Phu Yen, but he
also continued his advance to Nha Trang. He captured Po Nraup and forced him
to cede all territories north of the Phan Rang River. Po Nraup died shortly after
this, and in the turmoil of Vietnamese conquest a son and a grandson of Po
Ramo were successively but briefly appointed as vassal kings by the Vietnamese
until a measure of calm was restored under a Cham lord named Po Sot, who,
from1659 to 1692, governed at Phan Ri. The Chams, deprived of a seaport and
of good agricultural land, went through another major demographic adjustment
as many Muslims took the upland road from Nha Trang across the Central
Highlands to the Mekong and beyond to Siam, where they settled at Ayutthia.

The new border placed the modern province of Khanh Hoa, where Nha Trang is
located, under Vietnamese administration. Po Sot presided over the last sem-
blance of a Cham kingdom before Cham kings were reduced to being adminis-
trators of a minority people in a Vietnamese kingdom.
The seventeenth century also saw the first Vietnamese contact with the Khmers
of Cambodia and with the Siamese, whose rising influence over Cambodia
elicited Vietnamese interest in Khmer royal politics. At that time, Cambodia
included the entire lower plain of the Mekong River. The western provinces of
Cambodia were increasingly subject to Siamese power. At the same time, the
Vietnamese, allied with immigrant Chinese, established a sphere of action in the
eastern Cambodian provinces.
Around two centuries earlier, Khmer kings had abandoned Angkor, which
was located to govern an agricultural empire that included large parts of modern
Thailand. They shifted to sites on or near the Mekong River with access to the
sea and a new source of wealth that was based on international trade. In the late
fifteenth century, Siam achieved a new level of regional ascendancy under the
leadership of Naresuan (reigned1590–1605). When they could no longer resist
the Siamese, Khmer kings solicited military assistance from the communities of
foreigners who had gathered in their kingdom attracted by trade: Chinese,
Japanese, Malays, Chams, Portuguese, and Spanish, but to no avail. In the first
decade of the seventeenth century, Cambodia was reduced to the status of a
Siamese vassal. However, in1618, Chei Chéttha II became king of Cambodia
and, with Siam under threat from Burma, he repudiated Siamese vassalage in a
way that elicited the beginning of Vietnamese involvement in Cambodian affairs.
Chei Chéttha II turned to Nguyen Phuc Nguyen for assistance in resisting the
Siamese. It seemed to be a good idea because there was no common border with
the Vietnamese and the antagonism between the Trinh and the Nguyen promised
to keep them busy with each other. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen married his second
daughter Ngoc Van to Chei Chéttha II. With her went an entourage of around
1,000 Vietnamese, including soldiers to serve as bodyguards and a Vietnamese
official to serve as resident ambassador. In1622, the Vietnamese participated in
a naval battle that defeated a Siamese invasion. A community of Vietnamese
began to form at the Khmer capital.
In 1623, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen asked Chei Chéttha II for the authority to
collect taxes at Prei Nokor and Kampong Krabei. These were adjacent settle-
ments that were the economic and administrative centers of the easternmost
Khmer province, in the basin of the Daung Nay (Vietnamese Dong Nai) River
on the Cham frontier. Khmer histories affirm that Chei Chéttha II agreed to this
as a temporary arrangement of five years, supposedly to give his ally some
consideration for the assistance against Siam in the previous year. Khmer

historians may have interpolated the idea of a five-year term for this arrangement
to support later requests by Khmer kings that the Vietnamese return the privil-
eges they had been granted, but this does not take into account that a population
of Chinese and Vietnamese traders and adventurers was already accumulating in
the basin of the Dong Nai River.
Prei Nokor was a Chinese commercial center on the site of modern Cholon
(“ big market” ), the Chinese district of modern Saigon. A Chinese population of
merchants was already established there. It was situated to take advantage of
waterways connecting the eastern part of the Mekong plain with access to the sea
via the Sai Gon and Dong Nai Rivers. Kampong Krabei (Vietnamese Ben Nghe)
was on the Sai Gon River, on the site of modern Saigon, and was primarily an
administrative center. A Vietnamese garrison was established there, and officials
were assigned to collect revenue, to report events in the region, and to keep some
measure of order among the Chinese and Vietnamese population, which included
banished criminals, fugitives, and vagabonds as well as merchants and agricul-
turalists. The Vietnamese called the Kampong Krabei garrison by the name Gia
Dinh.
When Chei Chéttha II died in1627, his eldest son reigned for five years as Srei
Thoamareachea I. However, Chei Chéttha II’s younger full brother Barom
Reachea exercised great authority as the “ second king ” (opphayoreach).
Vietnamese envoys arrived bearing gifts and requested that Ngoc Van, Chei
Chéttha II’s Vietnamese widow, be elevated to the rank of“ queen mother,” the
highest position for a woman at court. She had given birth to a daughter but had
no sons. In consideration of the importance that the Khmer court gave to the
Vietnamese alliance, this request was granted. With the envoys came500 Viet-
namese soldiers to reinforce her bodyguard.
In 1632, Srei Thoamareachea I provoked a war with his uncle Barom Reachea
by indulging in an affair with Barom Reachea’s wife. Srei Thoamareachea I had
encouraged a large influx of Chinese residents during his years as king and they
supplied him with troops in the struggle with his uncle. For his part, Barom
Reachea’s forces included a contingent of Portuguese. Srei Thoamareachea I was
defeated, killed, and replaced by a younger brother, Ang Tong Reachea. How-
ever, Barom Reachea was the actual ruler. Shortly after, as Nguyen Phuc Nguyen
was preoccupied with his northern border and with his approaching death,
Barom Reachea requested that the Vietnamese evacuate Prei Nokor and Kam-
pong Krabei. This request was withdrawn after the intercession of the Vietnam-
ese“ queen mother,” Ngoc Van. In the late 1630s, the Dutch established a
trading station in Cambodia, introducing a new source of tension into the
kingdom in the form of Dutch–Portuguese hostility that was prone to erupt in
violence.

When Ang Tong Reachea died in1640, Barom Reachea placed his own son on
the throne as Botum Reachea I. A son of Chei Chéttha II refused to accept this,
however, and in1642, with the support of Ngoc Van, he killed his uncle Barom
Reachea and his cousin Botum Reachea I, along with many members of their
family and officials who had supported them; he then took the throne as
Reameathipadei I. He married a Muslim, identified in some texts as Malay and
in others as Cham, and converted to Islam (taking the title Sultan Ibrahim),
thereby gaining the support of the Malay and Cham communities and their
military forces. He took the side of the Portuguese against the Dutch, which
led to a brief war with the Dutch that ended with their expulsion.
Vietnamese merchants became more active in Cambodia at this time, particu-
larly in buying rice needed to supply the heavily militarized population among
the walls on their northern frontier. Ngoc Van preserved her high position as
“queen mother” with her own palace and entourage. She continued to deflect
tentative Khmer efforts to regain Prei Nokor and Kampong Krabei. Two of
Barom Reachea’s sons, Ang So and Ang Tan, who had escaped the homicidal
inauguration of Reameathipadei I’s reign, found safety in her entourage, as
did her grandson, Srei Chei Chét, the son of her daughter and of Botum
Reachea I. These princes were determined to avenge the deaths of their fathers.
In 1658, as King Narai of Siam made a show of preparing to invade from the
west, Ang So led a rebellion against Reameathipadei I. Ang So easily raised
support from the Buddhist leaders who were alienated from the Muslim king,
but Reameathipadei I raised a large army that included Malays, Chams, some
150–200 men from the Vietnamese garrison, and the ships of Europeans that
happened to be in Cambodia at the time, including the Dutch (who meanwhile
had made peace with Reameathipadei I and had regained a trading station in the
country), the English and, briefly, the Spanish and the Danes. Having endeavored
during previous years to keep the peace between Reameathipadei I and the
princes whose fathers he had killed, the Vietnamese queen mother Ngoc Van
was caught in the middle. Nevertheless, when the rebellion began to fail and Ang
So appealed to her, she sent a request to Nguyen Phuc Tan for help.
At that time, Nguyen Phuc Tan was engaged in a prolonged invasion of the
north that had begun three years before. He was determined that the Gia Dinh
garrison not be disturbed, for it was an important source of wealth and supplies.
Other than that, he was not concerned about who would rule Cambodia, but he
saw an opportunity to launch an expedition for plunder to supply his armies in
the north and to degrade the potential of Khmer kings to oppose his policies in
the future. In late1658, he sent a fleet with around3,000 well-trained and
disciplined men down the coast and up the Mekong. Its sudden appearance in
the heart of the Khmer kingdom gave Reameathipadei I little time to prepare for

the river battle that ensued. Reameathipadei I was captured, and the Vietnamese
systematically looted the capital of Oudong, loading around one hundred boats
with plunder, including gold, silver, various weapons, and1,600 pieces of
artillery. They also obtained eight hundred elephants and even more horses.
Among the assets the Vietnamese found in Cambodia was a Portuguese cannon
maker named Jean de la Croix. When they departed Cambodia in spring of
1659, the Vietnamese took this man with them and set him to work in their gun
foundries.
When he understood that the Vietnamese had come on a looting expedition,
Ang So resisted them and, when the Vietnamese had left, he proclaimed himself
king as Barom Reachea VIII. Nguyen Phuc Tan sent Reameathipadei I back to
Cambodia as his vassal, but he died along the way. An army of Cham and Malay
Muslims rose up against Barom Reachea VIII, who was a devout Buddhist, but
were defeated and took refuge with King Narai of Siam. Barom Reachea VIII
gave particular preference to the Chinese community in Cambodia. In1667,a
large group of Chinese, reportedly over3,000, arrived from Taiwan. In a surprise
attack that had the approval of Barom Reachea VIII, the Chinese set upon the
one to two thousand Vietnamese who resided near the capital, killing most of
them, capturing some, and sending the survivors fleeing north. The Chinese then
set upon the Dutch, seizing their property, killing many and expelling the rest.
Thus, the Chinese removed their two largest competitors for control of the local
economy. Barom Reachea VIII proclaimed an end to relations with the Vietnam-
ese and prohibited them from entering his kingdom. This had no effect upon the
Vietnamese garrison at Gia Dinh, which remained as before.
Barom Reachea VIII was killed in1672 by his nephew, Srei Chei Chét, who
appears to have had no greater motive than an urgent desire to be king. The
regicide’s uncle, Ang Tan, who was the“ second king,” feared for his own life
and fled to the court of Nguyen Phuc Tan, leaving behind his wife, a prominent
princess, as well as his nephew and adopted son, Ang Nan, the son of a deceased
younger brother, who reportedly had been Barom Reachea VIII’s designated
heir. When Srei Chei Chét attempted to make Ang Tan’s wife his queen, she
had him killed and, following her advice, the royal court sent for the eldest son of
Barom Reachea VIII, who had meanwhile become a forest monk, and enthroned
him as Kèv Fa II.
Rivalry between Kèv Fa II and Ang Nan quickly spun out of control. Kèv Fa II
made a show of calling in the Siamese to pacify Ang Nan. In1674, Ang Nan
departed to seek assistance from the Vietnamese. On the way, he met Ang Tan
accompanied by the second Vietnamese expedition to Cambodia. Unlike the first
expedition of1658, which had essentially been for plunder, this expedition was
prepared to undertake an extended campaign on behalf of Ang Nan. Nguyen

Phuc Tan wanted not only to safeguard the Vietnamese position at Gia Dinh and
to gain the benefits of trade with Cambodia, but also to counter Siamese influ-
ence by nurturing the ambitions of friendly Khmer princes.
Initial Vietnamese victories sent Kèv Fa II to the Siamese border, but the sudden
death of Ang Tan left the pro-Vietnamese faction of the Khmer royal family in the
less-experienced hands of Ang Nan. Siamese assistance reinvigorated Kèv Fa II’s
cause, and soon Kèv Fa II counterattacked against the Vietnamese and their
Cambodian allies. Vietnamese reinforcements arrived and the fighting continued.
When Kèv Fa II died in1677, his half-brother became king as Chei Chéttha III.
Meanwhile, Ang Nan had proclaimed himself the“ second king.” The result of this
turmoil was the partitioning of the kingdom between Chei Chéttha III in the north
and west, supported by Siam, and Ang Nan in the east and south, supported by the
Vietnamese. The wars that ensued between Chei Chéttha III and Ang Nan con-
tinued beyond Nguyen Phuc Tan’s lifetime and entrenched the Siamese and the
Vietnamese as regular participants in Khmer politics.
Vietnamese involvement in Cambodian affairs started with the calculations of
a Khmer king, Chei Chéttha II, who viewed the Vietnamese as a relatively non-
threatening ally against Siamese domination. Granting Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s
request to collect revenue at Prei Nokor and Kampong Krabei, on the far eastern
edge of the kingdom, where Chinese and Vietnamese had already begun to settle,
was a plausible means to keep interested and involved a distant ally distracted by
more serious matters elsewhere. Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s daughter, Ngoc Van,
anchored a Vietnamese presence at the heart of the Khmer kingdom for forty
years. She exercised her skill in navigating Khmer royal politics and in promoting
the interests of her family until the first Vietnamese expedition in1658, after
which she is no longer mentioned in any surviving records.
In the1670s, with the end of the Trinh wars and with appeals for intervention
by Khmer princes, Nguyen Phuc Tan analyzed a frontier problem without
precedent in Vietnamese historical experience. Until then, Vietnamese frontiers
had always been mountain passes or rivers or places where the ever-present
western mountains ran out into the sea. But here there were no western moun-
tains, no mountain passes, no transverse rivers, nothing but a vast deltaic plain
through which the branches of a great river flowed out to the sea. The first
moves, made by Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, were methods of establishing relation-
ships and influence that had been traditional with upland chieftains: a marriage
alliance and the arrival of Vietnamese settlers and soldiers. In1658, Nguyen
Phuc Tan had exercised another mode of action that had been used for centuries
with the Chams: an expedition to temporarily seize and plunder the capital of a
neighboring kingdom. In the1670s, however, Nguyen Phuc Tan began to view
the situation in a new way.

The Khmer monarchy was located in the midst of a vast plain, for which the
Dong Nai and Sai Gon River basin was like an antechamber for the Vietnamese.
The only means of transport were up the branches of the Mekong that came
together at the center of the kingdom before branching off to the“ Great Lake”
(Tonle Sap) and upriver to Laos. Siam stood watching just beyond. There was no
terrain to barricade a border against enemies, nor was Cambodia like Champa, a
relatively vulnerable and isolated neighbor that could be kept weak by periodi-
cally looting its capital. The characteristic circumstances of this new kind of
frontier were clearly apparent by1674 when the Khmer royal family was split
into pro-Siamese and pro-Vietnamese factions. Nguyen Phuc Tan saw that rival
Khmer princes would define the Siamese and Vietnamese spheres of influence in
their country and that the next necessary step on his southern border was to ally
with a Khmer prince and to cultivate clients in the Khmer royal family.
Thus, by the1670s, the Cham kingdom had been deprived of its last major
seaport and pushed into a relatively arid corner, and the Khmer kingdom had
been partitioned into two realms under rival kings, one a vassal of Siam and the
other a vassal of the Vietnamese. Furthermore, the Vietnamese had established a
position at modern Saigon and Cholon that would never be relinquished and that
was destined to become the largest of all Vietnamese cities.
Nguyen Phuc Tan, Trinh Tac, and the Nghe An campaign
During the three decades of the1650s, 1660s, and1670s, Trinh Tac in the north
and Nguyen Phuc Tan in the south made decisions that moved the two Vietnam-
ese countries beyond the military impasse that became increasingly apparent in
those years. They were both strong leaders who took a detailed interest in
government and who had definite ideas about priorities. While Trinh Tac was
occupied with internal tensions that had become embedded in his realm, Nguyen
Phuc Tan considered how best to maintain the expansionary energy of his realm.
Following the war of1648, Trinh Tac became increasingly preoccupied with
intrigues and conspiracies stimulated by Trinh Trang’s failing health. Although
Trinh Tac was by now the chief decision-maker at Dong Kinh, his aging father
continued to hold his own court with his own circle of powerful favorites, some
of whom harbored extravagant ambitions. Trinh Tac also had enemies among
the princes of his own family who sought to undermine his authority by manipu-
lating the people in Trinh Trang’s entourage. The premature death of the young
king, Le Duy Huu, in1649 may have been related to a conspiracy against Trinh
Tac, for Dutchmen arriving at Dong Kinh in that year reported that Trinh Tac
had poisoned both an uncle and the young king. Eunuchs were particularly

prominent among Trinh Trang’s confidants. They held high military and civil
positions and were in control of the lucrative silk industry. In1652, when Trinh
Trang’s health temporarily worsened, a conspiracy was uncovered that was led
by a eunuch and included court officials, Japanese merchants, and a sorcerer, all
of whom were close to Trinh Trang.
While Trinh Tac waited apprehensively through his father’s declining years,
Nguyen Phuc Tan gloried in his victorious army and dreamed of new adventures.
He quickly established a reputation for his knowledge of ancient history, for
paying close attention to matters of government, and for maintaining a disci-
plined style of life. When a beautiful female singer arrived from the north and
gained entrance to his palace, he was reminded of an episode in antiquity where
just such a woman from the land of an enemy had brought down a kingdom. He
ordered that she be taken out of the palace and killed.
In 1653, he organized a massive military exercise in the Hue region with nearly
400 war boats and 20,000 men. In military matters, he was listening to two
generals. Nguyen Huu Tien, the son-in-law and protégé of Dao Duy Tu, was
calm, methodical, and relied upon strict discipline and careful planning. Nguyen
Huu Dat was a brilliant strategist who favored feints and ambushes and liked to
sow confusion among northern leaders by sending letters to arouse their fear of
treason. Nguyen Huu Dat was arguing for an invasion of the north, something
that had been on his mind since1623 when he had blurted it out at Nguyen Phuc
Nguyen’s court on the occasion of Trinh Tung’s death. Nguyen Phuc Tan was
inclined to agree but wanted the steadier hand of Nguyen Huu Tien in command.
There was rivalry between the two generals. In early1655, Nguyen Phuc Tan
resolved the question of command by reporting a poem recited to him by a divine
being in a dream that contained classical allusions indicating that Nguyen Huu
Tien should have seniority over Nguyen Huu Dat.
In 1655, the two generals embarked on an invasion of the north. They were
partnered in a two-headed command, in which Nguyen Huu Dat’s ideas set the
battlefield agenda and in which Nguyen Huu Tien had the final word. During the
first four years, so long as the southerners enjoyed success, this partnership was
harmonious. However, after the death of Trinh Trang and after Trinh Tac had
taken a firm grip on authority at Dong Kinh and was able to organize the
superior resources of the Red River plain, the southerners began to suffer loses
and the two generals began to quarrel.
During 1655, the southerners advanced steadily into Nghe An. The northern
commanders suffered defeat after defeat and, by mid summer, were recalled to
Dong Kinh, demoted, and replaced by new senior officers arriving with
reinforcements. However, the southerners continued to advance, reaching the
Lam River, the lowland portion of the Ca River, which flows through the

modern city of Vinh. The situation became so critical for the northerners that in
autumn Trinh Tac himself arrived with more reinforcements. He spent three
months on the battlefield and managed to push the southerners back somewhat.
When he returned north near the end of the year, he left his younger brother
Trinh Toan (d.1674) in command.
In early1656, the southerners returned to the offensive, sending their navy up
the Lam River and consolidating their control of the southern bank of the river
while threatening to cross to the northern bank. At mid year, Trinh Tac sent his
eldest son, Trinh Can, with a new army. There followed several months of
dismay and confusion among Trinh officers as Trinh Can established a head-
quarters separate from Trinh Toan and received most of the supplies and men
being sent south. Trinh Toan was popular among the soldiers, but his elder
brother, Trinh Tac, did not trust him. Trinh Tac feared that Trinh Toan’s influ-
ence in the army posed a threat to himself. Trinh Can was stable, cautious, and
level headed, while Trinh Toan was noted for an excitable temperament with
flashes of inspiration. Many officers were devoted to him and found it hard to
swallow the realization that he was being pushed aside. Meanwhile, the southern
generals were receiving messages not only from the Mac in Cao Bang but also
from prominent leaders in the Red River plain, promising to rise up and attack
the Trinh when the southerners crossed the Lam River.
Nevertheless, the soldiers accumulating under Trinh Can’s command halted
the southern advance at the Lam River. In mid1656, Nguyen Phuc Tan met with
his generals and was told by Nguyen Huu Dat that new recruits arriving from the
south lacked training and discipline and were alienating the population of Nghe
An. Nguyen Huu Dat recommended that the southerners fortify their position on
the southern bank of the Lam River, consolidate their gains, discipline their men,
and await a new opportunity to advance.
In early1657, Trinh Trang finally died. Tac had the situation well in hand and
there was no succession disturbance in Dong Kinh. However, when Trinh Toan
was subsequently recalled and imprisoned at the capital, many northern officers
defected to the south. Southern efforts to establish a structure of regular govern-
ment in Nghe An south of the Lam River began to bear fruit in1658 as educated
men from that region were recruited to administer villages, capture criminals,
dispense justice, and to collect rice and other taxes to supply the southern armies.
When local people expressed uneasiness about the new regime, men were sent
out to explain matters to them and to win them over to the southern cause.
Unknown numbers of people were recruited, or possibly coerced, to go south,
where they were resettled in the more southerly Nguyen Phuc territories.
The southern advance reached its furthest extent in1658 with heavy fighting
around Vinh and even a southern foray through the mountains with the

collaboration of an upland chieftain that briefly threatened Quynh Luu near the
northern border of Nghe An. However, by the end of the year, Trinh Can had
fended off the southern attacks and had gained an important victory at Huong
Son district in the foothills that anchored his defense of the Lam River. From this
time on, the southern position became increasingly difficult to maintain as Trinh
Tac ruled with a confidence that had not been possible during the lifetime of his
father.
At the beginning of1658, Trinh Tac initiated a new era in northern govern-
ment with the proclamation of the Vinh Tho reign period. He put Pham Cong
Tru and other literati officials from the Red River plain at the center of decision-
making with the mandate to reform government according to their ideas. They
had been educated to regard the Hong Duc government of Le Tu Thanh as the
model for good government. The examination scheduled for1655 had been
postponed because of the military emergency of that year, and when it was held
in1656 only six men were selected. However, examinations were held in1658
and in 1659 with twenty-two men being selected in each of those years. The
prospects of many literati families in the Red River plain that had suffered for
their service to the Mac began to rise from this time. The legislation of the Vinh
Tho era (1658–1662) covered nearly every aspect of government: population
registers; taxation; conscription; legal tender; internal customs stations; roads
and dikes; education; examinations; administrative appointments; judicial pro-
cedures; public sacrifices; and public morality. Some legislation specifically
addressed the recruitment of soldiers in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, including
their landholding rights and tax obligations.
By 1659, Trinh Tac was in a position to push back at the southerners. He
treated Nguyen Huu Dat to a taste of his own style of intrigue by sending him
gifts and a letter inviting him to defect. Nguyen Huu Dat immediately informed
Nguyen Phuc Tan, who trusted him completely, but rumors among southern
officers in Nghe An about Nguyen Huu Dat being in secret communication
with the enemy began to circulate. When a spy arrived at Nguyen Huu Dat’s
headquarters and reported on conditions in the north, Nguyen Huu Dat sent
him back across enemy lines without first having him report to Nguyen Huu
Tien. This irritated Nguyen Huu Tien and increased suspicion of Nguyen Huu
Dat among his colleagues. Nguyen Huu Dat reacted to these doubts about his
loyalty by feigning“ illness” and withdrawing into inaction. Amidst the discord
in the southern camps, many northern officers and men who had previously
defected to the south went back to rejoin the northern forces, and soldiers
recruited by the southerners in Nghe An also began to defect. Trinh agents
circulated among the villagers in the territory occupied by the southerners
spreading discontent.

The southern armies had remained mostly inactive during1659 and early
1660, immobilized by dissention and declining morale. In mid1660, Nguyen
Huu Tien launched an offensive without informing Nguyen Huu Dat. Nguyen
Huu Dat, hearing of it after it had begun, quickly brought his armies into the
battle, and the southerners gained a foothold on the northern bank of the Lam
River. At that point, Nguyen Phuc Tan met with his generals to evaluate the
situation. There were voices urging a continuation of the offensive, but Nguyen
Phuc Tan had had enough. He told his generals that their men were weary and
homesick and that supplying an advance beyond the Lam River would be very
difficult. He ordered them to return to the southern bank of the river and fortify
their positions. Shortly after this, Trinh Can took the offensive, striking across
the river and gaining victories.
As Trinh Can advanced, the men who had been recruited from Nghe An into
the southern armies began a stampede of desertion to join the northerners.
A debate among the southern generals over what to do about this broke what-
ever cooperative spirit yet existed between Nguyen Huu Tien, who favored
capital punishment for these deserters, and Nguyen Huu Dat, who argued for
clemency. Under constant pressure from Trinh Can’s attacks, Nguyen Huu Tien
decided to retreat and did so without informing Nguyen Huu Dat, leaving him in
an exposed position. Nguyen Huu Dat was nevertheless quick to realize what
was happening and joined the southern withdrawal. The northern armies
followed and arrived at the Gianh River by the end of1660. In early 1661,
Trinh Can traveled to Dong Kinh for a hero’s welcome.
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that by1659 Nguyen Phuc Tan was no
longer interested in conquering the north. He may have been able to dispel the
dissention among his generals, rally the morale of his soldiers, and solve the
supply problems of an advancing army. Many of his officers clearly felt that this
was possible. However, he chose to see it differently. He allowed his armies to
remain inactive for a year and a half at a critical point in the war. When his
generals crossed the Lam River, he brought them back. When they retreated to
the Gianh River, there is no indication that he was unhappy with them. He did
not punish his defeated generals, which was standard practice in the north. He
immediately set Nguyen Huu Dat to work building a new wall ten kilometers
north of the existing system of walls. He was content to keep the northerners out.
He apparently did not want to govern the north with its deep-seated regional
rivalries and its relative poverty. And, perhaps most important of all, he preferred
not to have the headache of playing nursemaid to a monarchy that could neither
be abandoned nor be allowed to grow up. In the south, he was free to be the lord
of his own kingdom. If he wanted adventure, the far south could provide plenty
of that. The two Vietnamese realms no longer shared a common context of

political ambition. The Nghe An war had taught Nguyen Phuc Tan that con-
quering the north would not be worth the trouble.
After successfully concluding a difficult war to expel an invader that had lasted
for six years, Trinh Tac could not resist enthusiasm for another effort to break
through the southern walls. In late1661, Trinh Can led his men across the Gianh
River and, after heavy fighting, took Nguyen Huu Dat’s new wall. However, he
could not break through the Dong Hoi Wall at the mouth of the Nhat Le River.
A southern counterattack in early1662 sent him retreating back north. There-
after, the border was quiet for ten years.
Nguyen Phuc Tan did not let down his guard toward the north. After with-
drawal of the northern army in1661, he sent Nguyen Huu Tien and Nguyen
Huu Dat to build a new wall a short distance north of the Dong Hoi Wall, called
the Tran Ninh Wall, which blocked the coastal plain and was a northern
extension of the existing system of walls. It was designed to prevent northern
land and sea forces from joining to concentrate at the mouth of the Nhat Le
River. In subsequent years, he gave detailed attention to the recruitment of
soldiers and to organizing countrywide military mobilizations for training pur-
poses. He instituted a regime of daily shooting practice for his gunners and
musketeers. In1669, he extended his regulations on recruitment and training
to the new territories seized from Champa during the previous decade, the
modern province of Khanh Hoa and beyond to the Phan Rang River. Also at
this time, he realized that much new land had been opened up for cultivation but
was producing no tax revenue. He established an Agricultural Office to survey
fields, establish ownership, and levy taxes.
The last battle
Meanwhile, in the north, Trinh Tac and his literati advisors embarked on the
most ambitious effort to reform government since the time of Le Tu Thanh, two
centuries before. King Le Duy Ky died in late1662. Trinh Tac selected one of Le
Duy Ky’s sons,10-year-old Le Duy Vu, to sit upon the throne. The years of Le
Duy Vu’s reign, known as the Canh Tri reign period (1663–1671), became, after
Le Tu Thanh’s Hong Duc era, the most celebrated time of good government in
the historiography of Vietnamese Confucianists. The same kinds of laws, edicts,
rules, and regulations about examinations, appointments, promotions, demo-
tions, administrative and judicial procedures, corruption, abuse, public morality,
population registers, taxation, conscription, etc. were promulgated during the
Canh Tri period as had been routine during the reign of Le Tu Thanh. The
difference was that the Canh Tri period lacked a king like Le Tu Thanh and

lasted only one-quarter as long as that king’s reign. Instead of a king there was a
hard-bitten though somewhat enlightened warlord, Trinh Tac, and a gathering
of aspiring administrators shepherded by a group of old scholar-officials led by
Pham Cong Tru. There was no firm hand holding the system in place by force of
personality. Consequently, the bureaucratic procedures formulated at this time
simply became an arena for factional conflict over control of policy. The warriors
of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An were not to be so easily pushed aside by the“ poor
but erudite” scholars of the Red River plain.
The test of wills was not simply between military and civil officials but rather
among civil officials with different backgrounds and experiences. On one side
were those who had been closely involved with the armies during the Nghe An
campaign, most, but not all of them, from Nghe An and Thanh Hoa. These
favored continuation of the war in the south. On the other side were those who
had spent the war in villages mobilizing men and rice for the southern battle-
fields, most, but not all of them, from the Red River plain. These were ready to
end the conflict with the south. The question of continuing the war was not
necessarily the most important issue, but it came to stand for two conflicting
views of how the country should be governed.
The event that ignited the matter was the appointment of Pham Cong Tru’s
son, Pham Cong Kiem, to a high provincial post in1665. Some considered him to
be unqualified for the position, and, when his father retired three years later and
was no longer able to protect him, he was dismissed for incompetence. It is not
clear whether he was in fact incompetent or if he was a victim of intrigue. In
seeking his dismissal in1665, high officials of the military faction were hoping to
unravel the position of his father and those associated with him. Trinh Tac could
not allow this to happen, nor yet could he afford to give too much offense to the
men representing the view of his soldiers. Trinh Tac sought to finesse the matter
by charging those who had called for Pham Cong Kiem’s dismissal with relatively
minor violations of bureaucratic protocol and demoting them out of the top
echelon of the court hierarchy. During the following year, administrative disci-
pline was tightened and bureaucratic litigation was regulated as Trinh Tac
sought to keep both groups engaged in his government.
Regional examinations had become a scandal and already in1664 new rules
had been issued to stop rampant cheating. In the regional examinations of1666,
particular attention was given to candidates from Mo Trach, the home district of
the Vu family that was closely allied with Trinh Tac and which had been
famously successful in previous examinations. There had been so many recent
graduates from Mo Trach that accusations of chicanery were rife. Nevertheless,
despite all manner of precaution, men from this district were disproportionately
successful in1666. This could mean that this district enjoyed excellent

educational opportunities or it could mean that being connected to the Trinh
family trumped the most thorough efforts to prevent corruption. It was natural
that the struggle for control of policy spread to the examination system, which
afforded access to government positions. The effect of this was to immobilize the
capital examination of1667, in which only three men graduated.
By this time, those demoted in1665 were being promoted again as prospects
for a military solution to the Cao Bang problem materialized. In early1667,
diplomatic contact was established with the new Qing dynasty in China. Since
the Mac had been protected in Cao Bang by their status as a Ming vassal, Trinh
Tac wagered that the Qing would acquiesce to their demise. In autumn of1667 a
large Trinh army conquered Cao Bang, sending the last of the Mac leaders, Mac
Kinh Vu, fleeing to the Qing. However, to Trinh dismay, the Qing decided that
any Ming vassal also belonged to them, and in1669 the Trinh were ordered to
restore Cao Bang to Mac Kinh Vu. Not until1677, when Mac Kinh Vu joined
the rebellion of Wu Sangui in Yunnan against the Qing were the Trinh allowed to
occupy Cao Bang, thus finally bringing an end to the long political career of the
Mac family, though as late as1715 Trinh officials in Cao Bang still found it
necessary to hunt down a man causing unrest by claiming to be a descendent of
the Mac, and in1719 special instructions were issued to ensure security in that
sensitive border province.
The successful expedition to Cao Bang in 1667 did much to raise the
prospects of those arguing for a new invasion of the south. Pham Cong Tru
retired in1668, and officials close to the military regained high positions. Three
years of drought delayed preparations, but in1671 soldiers from the Red River
plain were being mobilized and trained. In1672 the Trinh armies moved south.
Trinh Tac, Trinh Can, and the new king,12-year-old Le Duy Hoi, all accom-
panied the expedition.
The southern army that waited at the walls was under the command of
Nguyen Phuc Tan’s 20-year-old fourth son, Prince Hiep, a brilliant, monkish
youth who had already earned the respect of military commanders two and three
times his age. Nguyen Huu Tien had died in1666, murmuring his chagrin at not
living to see the downfall of the Trinh. Nguyen Huu Dat was69 years old and
placed in command of a new, strategically sited fortification called Sa Phu,“ sand
port,” on the dunes overlooking the southern bank of the Nhat Le River mouth.
According to southern historians, there was a pre-battle parley between the
armies in which the old arguments were recited about which side was more loyal
to the Le dynasty, the southern view being that the Trinh were keeping the Le
kings as prisoners while the northerners accused the Nguyen of being in rebel-
lion. By now this was a very tiresome argument, and it was the last time for it to
be heard.

The Wall of Tran Ninh, erected ten years before in front of the pre-existing
network of walls, became the focus of battle. The Trinh were breaking through
this wall and were on the verge of overrunning it when Prince Hiep ordered
Nguyen Huu Dat to move his men across the river to reinforce it. Nguyen Huu
Dat went forward at night, his men bearing torches and planks to repair the walls
before an expected dawn attack. Prince Hiep moved up to Sa Phu and from there
directed a water battle denying the northern fleet entrance into the river. Mean-
while, Nguyen Huu Dat stopped the northern advance at the Wall of Tran Ninh.
The Trinh were forced to withdraw. It was the last battle in this Fifty Years War.
After victory celebrations, Prince Hiep, refusing any contact with women,
entered a temple to devote himself to the Buddha. He liked to go out and preach
about the Buddha to the common people. In1675, at the age of23, he died, a
shooting star of a hero.
Trinh Tac was determined to have done with this fruitless war. In1673,h e
recalled Pham Cong Tru out of retirement and began to systematically demote or
remove those who disagreed with him. When the capital examination of that
year graduated only five men amidst factional conflict, he ordered a special exam
to be held in which thirty men were selected. By early1674 he had outman-
euvered his opponents in the arena of bureaucratic appointments, and they
resorted to the only asset they had left, the soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe
An who were stationed in the capital as the palace guard. In the summer of1674,
incited by officials from those provinces who had many years of service but had
been recently dismissed, the guardsmen mutinied. They demolished Pham Cong
Tru’s house, killed Nguyen Quoc Trinh, one of Trinh Tac ’s most trusted
advisors, and demanded the release of Trinh Toan, Trinh Tac’s younger brother,
who had been popular among the soldiers and had lived in confinement since the
death of his father in1657.
Trinh Tac responded to this challenge with characteristic alacrity and guile.
Trinh Toan was given poison. Cash was distributed to the guardsmen. Their
ringleaders were discreetly seized and executed. The officials who had stirred up
the episode were reinstated for a few months until matters settled down and then
they were dismissed for the last time. Most significantly, Trinh Tac officially
conferred the dignity of leadership upon Trinh Can, taking himself out of the
limelight. The edict proclaiming the elevation of Trinh Can praised his military
achievements but, unlike every such kind of edict in the past, did not mention the
necessity of pacifying the south to complete the restoration of the Le dynasty.
The war policy was finally abandoned. When he died in1675 at the age of76,
Pham Cong Tru had the satisfaction of having contributed to a major reform of
government. When Trinh Tac died in1682, he had the satisfaction of having
engineered the first peaceful succession of power from one generation to the next

in his family since the beginning of its fortunes more than a century before. His
own prolonged accession had been marked by a battle with two of his brothers in
1645, by conspiracies in1649 and 1652, and by his pre-emptive arrest of Trinh
Toan when Trinh Trang finally died in1657.
The Canh Tri era produced one piece of legislation that had a long-term effect
on village politics and agrarian affairs, particularly in the Red River plain. In the
Hong Duc era, Le Tu Thanh had instituted a sexennial registration of land
ownership as the basis for taxation on fields. The periodic revision was intended
to take account of changes in land ownership, but it was a labor-intensive and
often litigious procedure that required relatively large numbers of officials and
clerks with sufficient authority to conduct the necessary investigations and to
assemble the required paperwork. It was a product of Le Tu Thanh’s unusual
interest in administration and his charismatic hands-on approach to government.
This system apparently continued in some form through the years of Mac rule. It
was able to function as long as the power of the central state had the ability to
reach into the villages and to compel the cooperation of village leaders.
The disorders accompanying the Le restoration led to the breakdown of the
sexennial registration system. During the decades of Trinh military occupation of
the Red River plain, agrarian taxes were collected in a relatively unsystematic, ad
hoc manner. Military authorities often ignored tax laws with arbitrary confisca-
tions, and different officials sometimes competed to obtain revenue from the
same source. The disaffection of the rural population combined with an absence
of rational government to create a gap between village authorities and the state.
Trinh Tac and his entourage of literati endeavored to revive rural administration,
including the sexennial registration system. But, the administrative capacity of
the state was unequal to the task. Provincial and district officials lacked the
manpower and expertise to penetrate the details of village property arrange-
ments, while village leaders had learned how to dissemble in their relations with
higher authorities.
Canh Tri was not Hong Duc, and Canh Tri legislation on agrarian taxation
displays the superficiality of Canh Tri achievements in comparison with those of
Hong Duc. In1664, in what became known as the“ equal rule” (binh le), or
Stabilization Act, a survey of land and registration of ownership was initiated
throughout the country. It was completed five years later and became the basis
for taxation from that time on. There would be no revisions. Changes in land
ownership thereafter would not be taken into account.
In practice, what this meant was that local leaders became responsible for the
collective assessment of their village. Instead of going into the villages to collect
taxes from individual taxpayers, district magistrates now stood at the village gate
and received what was due from the hands of village leaders. This measure

reflects the relative weakening of central administration in comparison with the
times of Le Tu Thanh and the Mac. It also reflects the relative strengthening of
the autonomy of village leaders and of their authority within the villages. The
well-known aphorism that“ the law of the king stops at the village gate” dates
from this time and reflects the Canh Tri compromise between villages and tax
collectors enacted by the Stabilization Act. The long-term impracticality of this
measure became glaringly apparent half a century later and subsequent efforts to
remedy its shortcomings led to decades of unrest and uprisings in the eighteenth
century.
A famous proclamation of the Canh Tri era is the47-article “ Edict to Explain
Civilizing Instructions” issued in1663, commonly interpreted as a major initia-
tive to enforce Confucian moral behavior. It systematically presents a list of
exhortations and prohibitions that had been regularly issued in more piecemeal
form since the fifteenth century and would continue to be issued into the
nineteenth century. Updated versions would appear in the late twentieth century.
This edict, and all the others like it, encouraged thought about public morality
and gave authorities a legal basis for their efforts to keep people involved in
productive work rather than letting them waste time on gambling, cockfighting,
playing chess, pornography, singing, dancing, lewd festivals, worshipping evil
spirits, sitting around in temples, or following strange religions. Nevertheless,
such edicts never put an end to these things.
Perhaps more successful were the rules for following a Confucian model of
family life with ancestral veneration, marriage rites, mourning regulations, and a
hierarchy of deference, which provided a blueprint for aspiring patriarchs and
families ambitious to gain favor with the rulers. Against the efforts of Confucian
officials to promulgate their values should be set the prospering of spirit cults, the
building and repair of Buddhist temples, and the spread of Christianity, all of
which were salient features of Vietnamese society in the seventeenth century.
The most important work of the Canh Tri people, so far as surviving know-
ledge about the Vietnamese past is concerned, was in writing history. Pham Cong
Tru supervised a continuation of the fifteenth-century work of Ngo Si Lien
through the reign of Le Duy Ky in1662, just before the beginning of the Canh
Tri era. Thirty years later, Le Hy (1646–1702), who began his career by passing
the capital examination of1664 as a teenager, supervised the addition of thirteen
additional years to1675, covering Canh Tri (1663–1671) and the short reign of
Le Duy Hoi that followed (1672–1675), which in effect carried the account
through to Pham Cong Tru’s death and included the victory of Trinh Tac over
the war party and the formal transfer of power to Trinh Can. This work was
printed with woodblocks in1697, and is known today as the Chinh Hoa Edition
of the Complete Book of the History of Great Viet. The writing of official

histories was traditionally defined by the rise and fall of dynasties. For Pham
Cong Tru and Le Hy and their colleagues, however, the dynastic idea was no
longer of historical importance. For them, it was as if they lived in a time when
educated men had found solid footing after many years of war and turmoil and
were able to celebrate the ascendancy of their pacific approach to government
over the vainglorious aims and violent means of warriors.
Nguyen Phuc Tan and Trinh Tac were the architects of two countries that
would subsequently go their separate ways for another century. Their predeces-
sors had remained entangled in each other’s ambitions, unable to entirely let go
of one another. But these two men understood that there was enough for them to
do without trying to rule the other’s country too.
Trinh Tac had to do something about the disconnection of his regime from the
majority of its population and the habits of intrigue that made leadership in his
family so precarious. Victory in the south would simply feed the power and
ambition of the most undisciplined elements of his regime, producing endless
problems. Ending hostilities with the south enabled him to concentrate on the
more urgent priority of building a government administration that would no
longer fear popular disaffection. The north was turning inward.
Nguyen Huu Dat, whose whole life had been dedicated to fighting the Trinh,
died in1681 at the age of78. His spirit was still alive a few months later, shortly
before Trinh Tac’s death, when rumors reached the south that the Trinh had
gone off to fight rebels and had left Dong Kinh unprotected. Voices were raised
at Nguyen Phuc Tan’s court proposing that it was an excellent time to attack the
north. Against this exuberant prospect, Nguyen Phuc Tan decided that not
enough men and supplies were available for such an adventure. It was the last
recorded discussion of such an idea at Nguyen Phuc Tan’s court. Sometime
during the Nghe An campaign, perhaps in1658, the year of the expedition to
Cambodia, Nguyen Phuc Tan lost interest in conquering the north. He began to
look south. Effort was more likely to yield benefit on the relatively open Mekong
frontier than on the densely populated and fiercely defended plains in the north.
When Nguyen Phuc Tan died in1687, the situation he had helped to create by
encouraging warfare among Khmer princes was moving rapidly toward a major
geo-political shift on the Vietnamese southern frontier. The south was turning
outward.

7 THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH DIVERGE
Relations with Cambodia
When Nguyen Phuc Tan died in1687, his39-year-old second son, Nguyen Phuc
Tran, came to power and shifted the seat of government to Phu Xuan, the
modern city of Hue. Nguyen Phuc Tran’s elder brother, Nguyen Phuc Tan’s
designated heir, had died three years before. Nguyen Phuc Tran’s short four-year
rule shows him to have been an uninspiring leader and a poor judge of character.
No sooner had he assumed command than the far south began to slip out of his
control, and the people he sent to deal with it were famous failures.
Nguyen Phuc Tan had left a situation on the southern frontier that was
unstable but full of promise. The two kings of Cambodia, the“first king” Chei
Chéttha III and the“second king” Ang Nan, had been in a more or less continual
state of war since the1670s, with Siamese troops intervening on behalf of Chei
Chéttha III and Vietnamese troops intervening on behalf of Ang Nan. Cambodia
was partitioned between the two Khmer princes with Ang Nan’s territories
generally coinciding with the parts of the country that would eventually become
Vietnamese.
In 1679, a new element was added with the arrival of a fleet of the Ming navy
that had been pushed out of Chinese seaports by the Qing Manchu conquerors.
This fleet had been operating in the South China Sea for many years and already
had contacts among Chinese merchants at Hoi An and other Vietnamese ports,
including Prei Nokor (modern Cholon). When over fifty ships with some three
thousand men, along with their families, arrived at Da Nang Bay and neighbor-
ing anchorages, Nguyen Phuc Tan directed them to the Mekong frontier. One
group under Chen Shangchuan settled at Bien Hoa on the Dong Nai River, not
far from Prei Nokor. A second group under Yang Yandi settled at modern My
Tho on the northern bank of the northernmost arm of the Mekong River,
accessible to Prei Nokor via canals and the Vam Co river system that drains a
vast swampy region between the Dong Nai/Sai Gon River basin and the Mekong

plain. Prei Nokor, located between the two settlements and protected by the
Vietnamese garrison at Kampong Krabei (Saigon), rapidly developed from this
time and became a major port city that attracted merchants from many Asian
and European countries. The Ming settlers maintained armies that in the1680s
began to participate in the Cambodian civil wars in support of Ang Nan. Chen
Shangchuan was particularly active in this regard.
Nguyen Phuc Tan had assembled the structure of loyalties holding together the
Vietnamese, the Chinese, and the Khmer followers of Ang Nan. After his death,
the court at Phu Xuan was unable to maintain this structure, and it began to
disintegrate. Furthermore, just at this time, the death of King Narai in Siam
produced a major political change there, which drew Siamese attention away
from Cambodia for a time. In1688, Yang Yandi, the Ming leader at My Tho,
was murdered by his lieutenant Huang Jin, who then built fortifications, trained
soldiers, preyed on shipping, and was rumored to harbor the ambition of seizing
control of all Cambodia. In response to this, Chei Chéttha III increased his
military forces and displayed indications of preparing for war. Ang Nan,
alarmed, appealed to Phu Xuan for help.
Nguyen Phuc Tran was persuaded by corrupt schemers to give command of
his army to a man without military ability. In1689, this man succeeded in
capturing and killing Huang Jin, and then, with Chen Shangchuan leading
the vanguard, he proceeded to attack Chei Chéttha III. However, according
to a story recorded by Vietnamese historians, he fell into the wiles of a beautiful
woman, Chei Chéttha III’s envoy, and, making peace with Chei Chéttha III,
he withdrew his army back to Kampong Krabei, becoming the laughing stock of
his generals. Hearing of this, Nguyen Phuc Tran dismissed the commander
and replaced him with Nguyen Huu Hao, a son of the famous general Nguyen
Huu Dat. In1690, once again the Vietnamese and Chinese forces, along with
Ang Nan’s Khmers, advanced against Chei Chéttha III. And once again Chei
Chéttha III’s seductive envoy made a laughing stock of the Vietnamese com-
mander by persuading him to withdraw his army and wait for gifts that never
came. Nguyen Phuc Tran dismissed Nguyen Huu Hao. Shortly after, in early
1691, Nguyen Phuc Tran fell ill and died with affairs on the Mekong frontier in
such disarray that Ang Nan killed himself in despair. Ang Nan’s 10-year-old
son, Ang Im, whose mother was Chinese, lived under the protection of Chen
Shangchuan. Such was the situation when Nguyen Phuc Tran’s eldest son,
Nguyen Phuc Chu, came to power.
Although only16 years old when he began to rule, Nguyen Phuc Chu quickly
established a reputation for intelligence, modesty, and effective leadership. In
1694he was confronted by a conspiracy of cousins, sons of Nguyen Phuc Tan’s
deceased eldest son, who believed they represented the“senior line” of the family

and thus had the right to exercise power. Without hesitation he seized and
executed the conspirators and their followers. Nguyen Phuc Chu governed for
thirty-four years, sired146 children, and added to his grandfather’s legacy of
making astute and far-sighted decisions. His first test was the disordered situ-
ation on the southern frontier. The incompetence of the men sent by his father,
and then his father’s death, apparently emboldened the Cham king, Po Sot, to
seize the Phan Rang region in defiance of Phu Xuan’s authority. Before dealing
with the Khmer situation, Nguyen Phuc Chu had to first respond to the Chams.
The man selected to go south was another son of Nguyen Huu Dat, a younger
brother of the hapless Nguyen Huu Hao named Nguyen Huu Canh. In1693,
Nguyen Huu Canh captured Po Sot. The Cham kingdom was reorganized into
the province of Binh Thuan (the modern provinces of Binh Thuan and Ninh
Thuan). Vietnamese officials were sent to administer the major coastal popula-
tion centers at Phan Rang, Phan Ri, and Phan Thiet. A Cham noble led some five
thousand Cham Muslims to join the Cham Muslim community in Cambodia.
Many Chams moved into the uplands and joined the Churu, Ede, and Jarai
peoples there.
Po Sot died shortly after, in captivity, but a younger brother of his named Po
Saktiray Depatih (known to the Vietnamese as Ke Ba Tu) was appointed as an
“aboriginal king” by the Vietnamese to govern the Cham population that
remained. In late1693 and early 1694, a Cham noble and a Chinese claiming
magical powers rallied an uprising among the Chams, but, after twice besieging
Phan Rang, they were driven off and fled for refuge in Cambodia.
Thereafter, until his death in1727, Po Saktiray Depatih maintained peaceful
relations between the Chams of Binh Thuan and the Vietnamese court at Phu
Xuan, sending tribute as required while endeavoring to shield the Chams from
the authority of Vietnamese administrators. The Vietnamese agreed to return all
the prisoners and plunder they had taken from Champa in the recent campaign.
For their part, the Chams were charged with an annual tribute of2 bull ele-
phants, 20 head of cattle,6 elephant tusks,10 rhinoceros horns,500 measures of
cloth, 50 measures of honey,200 measures of dried fish,400 measures of salt-
encrusted sand for making an alkaline solution used for washing hair,500
bamboo mats,200 ebony trees, and1 long boat.
In 1712 Po Saktiray Depatih obtained a“five-point treaty” with the Vietnam-
ese that, at least in theory, remained in effect until the abolition of the Cham
“aboriginal kingship” in 1832. According to this treaty, the Cham king had sole
jurisdiction over litigation among Chams, while litigation between Chams and
Vietnamese was to be jointly decided by Cham and Vietnamese officials. Other
provisions required that merchants moving through Cham territory to trade with
the upland peoples register with Cham officials and that Vietnamese authorities

were not to oppress or abuse Chams. Chams were supposedly required to adopt
the Vietnamese style of clothing, though it is not known to what extent this was
enforced. With most Muslim Chams having fled to Cambodia, those remaining
in Binh Thuan mainly followed the Hindu tradition in Cham culture. A separate
and distinctive population also appeared in subsequent generations from Cham–
Viet intermarriage that combined features of both Cham and Vietnamese culture.
In 1714, Po Saktiray Depatih traveled with his family and entourage to attend
a vegetarian feast celebrating the completion of a major construction project at
Thien Mu Temple in Phu Xuan. Later that year, he requested permission to erect
a new building where his administration of the Cham people could be conducted.
His request was approved and he received from the Vietnamese court an archi-
tectural plan for his magistracy. After his death, members of his family succeeded
him for several generations.
Nguyen Phuc Chu presided over the demise of Champa as a vassal kingdom
and its incorporation into the structure of Vietnamese government. This elimin-
ated the“Cham gap” that had separated the Vietnamese settlements in the Dong
Nai and Sai Gon River basin from the rest of the country and unambiguously
advanced the Vietnamese border to this“antechamber” of the Mekong plain.
This may have been what prompted Nguyen Phuc Chu to take an elevated title
for himself in1693 as “lord of the kingdom” (quoc chua) and two years later to
build a temple to venerate the spirits of his predecessors.
The poorly led expeditions sent to Cambodia by Nguyen Phuc Tran dimin-
ished Vietnamese prestige in the region, and Chei Chéttha III exploited this in
1696when he invited Ang Im, the15-year-old son of his deceased cousin and old
enemy Ang Nan, to come to his court at Oudong. Ang Im accepted the invitation
and was married to one of Chei Chéttha III’s daughters. The war that had
divided the Khmers since the1670s was seemingly at an end.
Building on the experience of erasing the Cham kingdom and establishing the
province of Thuan Thanh, Nguyen Phuc Chu proceded in1698 to establish
the province of Gia Dinh in the basin of the Dong Nai and Sai Gon Rivers.
The headquarters of the province was at Saigon. People were recruited from the
provinces in the north and sent to augment the Vietnamese population there.
Many of these were landless peasants and those without an apparent means of
livelihood.
According to missionary accounts, around 10 percent of the Vietnamese
population in Gia Dinh by the beginning of the eighteenth century was Christian.
That Christians were a discernible element in the Gia Dinh population can be
inferred from an order sent to Gia Dinh administrators in1699 to expel all
Christians and European missionaries, an order which seems not to have been
enforced. To any extent that it might have been enforced, such a ban would have

served only to send more Vietnamese settlers into marginal lands of the Mekong
plain. Vietnamese Christians were attracted to this frontier because of the greater
freedom there amidst the cultural diversity of Chinese, Khmers, and Chams.
Many Khmer communities with their own leaders continued to exist in Gia
Dinh. There were also Cham communities, although at that time most of the
Chams outside of Binh Thuan had settled under the protection of the Khmer
king.
The Chinese population of Gia Dinh was changing with the older Ming
immigrants congregating at Cholon and more recent Qing immigrants gathering
at Bien Hoa. The Ming Chinese population at My Tho was beyond the adminis-
trative jurisdiction of Gia Dinh, but nevertheless remained closely allied with the
Vietnamese authorities at Saigon. Chen Shangchuan, who commanded Chinese
military forces, was stationed at an advanced position upriver from My Tho,
near where the northern branch of the Mekong begins to split into several
channels on its way to the sea. His post was at Vinh Long, between the two
main branches of the Mekong, in a position to observe all riverine traffic in or
out of Cambodia. One of his assignments was to safeguard Chinese and Viet-
namese trade on the river.
Chei Chéttha III responded to the fait accompli of Nguyen Phuc Chu’s annex-
ation of Gia Dinh by making military preparations and, according to Chen
Shangchuan’s reports, interfering with trade. Nguyen Phuc Chu immediately
initiated military operations. In1700, Chen Shangchuan led the vanguard of
an expedition commanded by Nguyen Huu Canh, who seized the Khmer capital
and forced Chei Chéttha III to flee. Chei Chéttha III’s son-in-law, Ang Im, the
teenage son of Ang Nan who had been raised by his Chinese mother under the
protection of Chen Shangchuan before joining the Khmer royal court in1696,
first resisted the Phu Xuan forces on behalf of his father-in-law, and then
submitted to Nguyen Huu Canh, allowing himself to be made king of Cambodia
by the Vietnamese. Within weeks, however, Nguyen Huu Canh died, the Phu
Xuan forces withdrew, and Chei Chéttha III returned to the throne.
In the years that followed, Chei Chéttha III yielded increasing authority into
the hands of his son, who ruled as Srei Thoamareachea II and who elicited
Siamese intervention against Ang Im, now supported by the Vietnamese. In
1705, Nguyen Phuc Chu sent an expedition to push back the Siamese and to
advance Ang Im’s cause. Thereafter, Srei Thoamareachea II and Ang Im revived
the wars of their fathers, Chei Chéttha III and Ang Nan, which had lasted from
the1670s to the1690s. Interventions in this struggle by Siam and Phu Xuan
became routine during the first half of the eighteenth century, with Siam and Phu
Xuan both annexing parts of the Cambodian kingdom as the price of assistance
to their respective protégés.

One small aspect of the 1705 Vietnamese expedition involved an English
outpost that had been established in1702 on the island of Con Dao, about
ninety kilometers off the southern mouth of the Mekong River. Nguyen Phuc
Chu apparently tolerated this in expectation that the English would conform to
his policies toward Cambodia. But when the English indicated an interest in
trading with Cambodia and a large Cambodian delegation arrived at Con Dao,
Vietnamese authorities at Gia Dinh were instructed to eliminate this potential
source of interference in Phu Xuan’s policy toward Cambodia. Shortly before the
1705 expedition, the English and Khmers on Con Dao were massacred by
Macassarese mercenaries of the English and by Vietnamese residing on the
island. The Vietnamese governor at Gia Dinh apparently instigated this event,
for he arrived immediately after with soldiers to take possession of the island.
The Ming people who had settled at Bien Hoa and My Tho under the
authority of the fleet commanders in1679 were the most organized of a large
migration of refugees from the Qing conquest of China into the Mekong region.
Among this migration was a man from Guangdong named Mo Jiu (1655–1735)
who insinuated himself into the entourage of Chei Chéttha III and received from
him an appointment in the province of Peam (at the modern Vietnamese city of
Ha Tien), on the Gulf of Siam, where Khmer, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Malay
merchants gathered. He opened a gambling house and became exceedingly
wealthy. This place was a gateway from the sea into the Khmer kingdom that
did not rely upon the Mekong River. Amidst the confusions of the Khmer
kingdom in those years, Mo Jiu established himself as ruler of the western coast
of the Mekong’s deltaic plain, comprised of territories around the modern cities
of Ha Tien, Rach Gia, and Ca Mau, as well as the large island of Phu Quoc, all of
which at that time came to be known as Ha Tien to the Vietnamese.
As his patron Chei Chéttha III faded from the scene and the Sino-Vietnamese
presence grew along the Mekong, Mo Jiu did not find Srei Thoamareachea II to
be a reliable suzerain. In1708, he submitted to Nguyen Phuc Chu and received
an appointment to govern Ha Tien as a Vietnamese territory. Thereafter, he
cooperated with Phu Xuan in the complex game of politics along the main arms
of the Mekong River that involved Khmers, Siamese, Vietnamese, Chinese,
Chams, and also a community of nearly three thousand Laotians who had found
refuge with Chei Chéttha III in1691 after fleeing a power struggle in their
country. In just a few years of Nguyen Phuc Chu’s rule, Phu Xuan’s strategic
position had dramatically improved with the annexations of Gia Dinh and Ha
Tien, territories that anchored the eastern and western ends of a future Khmer–
Viet deltaic border.
Nguyen Cuu Van, the leader of the1705 expedition, subsequently served for
many years as governor of Gia Dinh. He asserted personal ownership over much

land in territories to the southwest and northwest of Saigon. Directly to the west
is a vast swampy region unsuitable for agriculture. His lands to the southwest, in
modern Tien Giang Province west of My Tho, were vulnerable to Khmer attack
so he built a defensive wall from the West Vam Co River to the northern branch
of the Mekong River. His practice of forcing settlers on his land into a serf-like
status was imitated by other locally powerful men and provoked sufficient unrest
that it was reported to Nguyen Phuc Chu in1711. Nguyen Phuc Chu admon-
ished Nguyen Cuu Van to stop enslaving people and ordered him to institute a
policy of distributing land to the landless and allowing them three years of
exemption from taxation. This measure reportedly calmed the situation, but
the practice of powerful men claiming vast lands worked by landless peasants
became characteristic of Vietnamese settlement in the Mekong plain.
Later that same year, Nguyen Cuu Van and Chen Shangchuan reported that
Srei Thoamareachea II was reinforcing his position in Cambodia with large
numbers of troops arriving from Siam. Nguyen Phuc Chu instructed them to
maintain vigilance, but he chose to postpone action until absolutely necessary,
understanding that the passing of time and the arrival of increasing numbers of
Vietnamese settlers would strengthen his position.
Finally, in late1714, Srei Thoamareachea II, reinforced with a Siamese army,
besieged Ang Im, probably at Srei Santhor, about forty kilometers north of
Phnom Penh, where his father’s headquarters had often been located. With
Ang Im and his Khmer followers was a military force recruited from the
Laotian community in Cambodia, which allied with him against the Siamese.
However, Ang Im’s enemies outnumbered him four to one, so he called to Gia
Dinh for help. Chen Shangchuan again led the way for Phu Xuan armies to
advance upriver and seize the Khmer capital. Srei Thoamareachea II fled to Siam
and the Vietnamese proclaimed Ang Im as King of Cambodia. Ang Im and his
son Ang Chi reigned as kings of Cambodia from then until1737. In the1720s
they fended off several Siamese invasions with Phu Xuan’s assistance. Chen
Shangchuan died in1715 but his son Chen Dading continued to loyally serve
Phu Xuan’s interests.
Politics and government in the south
Nguyen Phuc Chu was concerned with much more than the Mekong frontier. In
1697and again in 1714 he fought brief wars with upland chieftains who
threatened to cut the Cam Lo Road west from Quang Tri to the Mekong, a
route not only important commercially but also militarily because of its proxim-
ity to the northern border. In1700, he inspected the northern wall complex and

embarked on a two-year project to repair and renovate it. A year later he ordered
a map to be made of the entire country. Ten years later, the northern walls were
repaired once again and a survey was conducted of roads and beaches in the
border region. In1713, another inspection of the walls on the northern border
was made. Despite the seeming peace with the north, Nguyen Phuc Chu was
taking nothing for granted. In1715 he sent two Fujianese merchants into the
north as spies to evaluate Trinh military preparedness.
Military affairs took precedence over all other public concerns. Nguyen Phuc
Chu scheduled mobilizations of conscripts for military service on a five-year
cycle. In1707, he issued a detailed edict with twenty-two articles on military
conscription. In 1708 there were thirteen assembly points for organizing con-
scripts, five in Thuan Hoa, two in Quang Nam, and one each in Quang Ngai,
Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, Thuan Thanh, and Gia Dinh. Nguyen Phuc
Chu halted the1713 call-up when he learned that his officials were unlawfully
harassing people and acquiring personal fortunes by selling exemptions. In
addition to paying close attention to the system for acquiring soldiers, he empha-
sized military training. In1696, he began an annual event for his officials to
practice shooting muskets. In1701, he inspected a center for training soldiers in
how to shoot guns. In1700 he opened a school for performing horses and two
years later held an examination of his generals in horsemanship. He also insti-
tuted a new program for training elephants for battle. In1703 a new kind of
crossbow was introduced and it became all the rage to acquire one and to learn
how to shoot it. Elaborate naval and land exercises were regularly held to
simulate battlefield conditions and to sharpen military skills.
Nguyen Phuc Chu also gave close attention to education and to the system of
examinations for filling public positions. Literary examinations were regularly
held on a six-year schedule. There were five categories of achievement and
appointments were accordingly made to provincial or district offices, to oversee
education, or to work in one of the three“offices” of the central government (ty).
One of the categories that produced officials for the three“offices” was facility in
the Chinese spoken language, which reveals the importance of the Chinese
communities in the country.
The basic curriculum of literary examinations in the south was well established
by the end of the seventeenth century and continued through the eighteenth
century. Unlike the curriculum in the north, which was more academic and
emphasized skill in traditional poetic forms, the southern curriculum included
practical skills and new literary forms. The first level of achievement was to
demonstrate skill in a distich rhythmic prose of alternating four- and six-syllable
lines (tu-luc), a distinctive feature of southern exams. The second level was to
write compositions in the phu rhyming prose that had been part of the

Vietnamese curriculum since Tran times. The third level was the standard com-
position about the meaning of classical texts. The fourth level changed through
the years from tests in mathematics for calculating taxes and market duties, to
questions about case law for judging litigation in the late seventeenth century, to
dissertations on public policy by the mid eighteenth century. Students who
successfully completed the fourth level were qualified for appointments in gov-
ernment offices.
A new departure commonly thought to have appeared in Vietnamese literature
during the eighteenth century is an appreciation of women and of their point of
view, which was usually a complaint against Heaven for the hard life that women
had to lead. The earliest example of this kind of literature comes from Nguyen
Phuc Chu’s wife, Nguyen Kinh Phi (d.1714), who wrote four poems lamenting
the transience of her fading beauty and blaming Heaven for“robbing” her of her
youth. After her death, Nguyen Phuc Chu wrote four poems in response,
lamenting her death and accusing Heaven of“hating” his wife. In the poems of
both poets, readers are admonished not to“laugh” at such sentiments, for they
express feelings that all people experience. The mention of laughter reveals that
this kind of poetry exceeded existing conventions and was intentionally provoca-
tive. By the end of the century, the theme of a woman’s “complaint” against
Heaven would not only be acceptable in literature but it would also be used by
men to voice their feelings at a time when a man’s voice was not considered
appropriate to express complaints without suggesting an inclination to rebel
against political authority.
Nguyen Phuc Chu aspired to have his realm recognized by the Qing, thus
gaining imperial acknowledgment that he no longer owed allegiance to the Le
dynasty. In1702, he sent a letter to the Qing court requesting appointment as a
vassal separate from the Le. The Qing rejected the request, replying that the Le
dynasty yet reigned and thus remained the Qing vassal for that part of the world.
A separate Vietnamese kingdom could not penetrate the Qing system of vassal-
age. Nguyen Phuc Chu nevertheless expressed his aspirations with a new seal in
1709inscribed: “The Nguyen Lord Eternally Guarding the Kingdom of Great
Viet.”
The economic development of the Mekong during the first decade of the
eighteenth century led to an expansion of coastal shipping. The transport of rice
from the Mekong to the northern provinces, particularly Thuan Hoa with its
large military population on guard at the northern border, was a critical concern
of the Phu Xuan government. It had been subject to a system of conscripting boat
owners and requiring them to transport rice twice a year in exchange for tax
exemptions and allowances for expenses. However, as the coastal economy

business were so much more lucrative than government service. Consequently, a
major shift in government policy was initiated in1714 under the leadership of an
official named Nguyen Khoa Chiem, by which the government abandoned the
system of commandeering transport and instead simply joined the market by
purchasing rice with cash at prevailing rates while establishing a new tax scheme
on private shipping. This monetizing of the rice economy began to affect the
supply of money, which was already shrinking due to the decreasing availability
of coins from China and Japan, and within a few decades became a factor
contributing to serious fiscal problems.
Nguyen Phuc Chu died in1725 and was succeeded by his30-year-old eldest
son, Nguyen Phuc Tru. During his thirteen years of rule, Nguyen Phuc Tru did
not show as much personal engagement with government as did his father, but
rather relied upon the senior members of his entourage to handle affairs. Three
families that were particularly prominent at this time were the Nguyen Cuu, the
Nguyen Khoa, and the Truong Phuc.
Nguyen Cuu Kieu, the man who had fled to the south in1623 with a letter
from Trinh Trang’s wife to her brother Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, was the founder of
the Nguyen Cuu family. Nguyen Cuu Van, who had led the1705 expedition to
Cambodia and served for many years thereafter as the governor of Gia Dinh, was
a grandson of Nguyen Cuu Kieu. He was prominent in opening up land to
Vietnamese settlement west of My Tho, between the Mekong and West Vam
Co Rivers. In1715, Nguyen Cuu Chiem, a son of Nguyen Cuu Van, became
governor of Gia Dinh and inherited lands that his father had possessed along the
East Vam Co River, northwest of Saigon in the region of modern Tay Ninh,
which, during the next two decades, he opened up to Vietnamese settlement. He
was still the governor at Gia Dinh in the1730s when another round of fighting
led to the annexation of more territory.
The Nguyen Khoa family traced its ancestry to a man who had come south with
Nguyen Hoang in 1558. In the early eighteenth century, the most prominent
person of this family was Nguyen Khoa Chiem, who made his mark both in
administration and in literature. He was the official who had monetized the system
of coastal rice transport in1714. He also wrote a book that he entitledStories
about the Achievements of the Southern Court(Nam Trieu Cong Nghiep Dien
Chi), a book now commonly referred to asStories about the Founding of the
Country of Viet Nam(Viet Nam Khai Quoc Chi Truyen), which is an anecdotal
history of the south from the time of Nguyen Hoang through the time of Nguyen
Phuc Tan (mid sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth century).
Nguyen Khoa Chiem’s second son, Nguyen Khoa Dang, became a prominent
official at Phu Xuan in the1720s. Nguyen Khoa Dang was famous for being
utterly honest and very strict in the performance of his official duties. He was an

excellent judge and many stories were told of how he decided difficult cases. He
was greatly trusted by Nguyen Phuc Chu, who appointed him to many difficult
assignments, including supervision of the treasury and of the“meat ration” for
members of the Nguyen Phuc family and of other prominent families at court.
Perhaps his enthusiasm for doing the right thing was too exuberant for Phu
Xuan. He earned the enmity of powerful families at court by persuading Nguyen
Phuc Chu to require that they pay back all the money they had“borrowed” from
the treasury. Shortly after the death of Nguyen Phuc Chu in1725, a cousin of
Nguyen Cuu Van accused Nguyen Khoa Dang of treason and he was put to
death, only35 years old, unprotected by Nguyen Phuc Tru.
Another family that, like the Nguyen Cuu family, was prominent both at the
Phu Xuan court and in Gia Dinh, was descended from Truong Phuc Phan, who
had gained fame during the Trinh invasion of1648 by calmly directing the
defense of the last wall amidst desperate fighting. One of his grandsons had been
governor at Gia Dinh during the episode of eliminating the English base on Con
Dao Island. In1731, Nguyen Phuc Tru appointed another member of this family,
Truong Phuc Vinh, to be“controller” in overall command of the Mekong River
plain. This was a new position. It was made amidst a new crisis in the far south
and a perception that government authority there had become too decentralized
with Nguyen Cuu Chiem at Gia Dinh, Mo Jiu at Ha Tien, and Chen Dading, son
of Chen Shangchuan, at My Tho. Truong Phuc Vinh was eager to rebuild the
fortunes of his family on this frontier. The situation that he faced in1731 arose
from events within the Laotian community in Cambodia, which had supported
Ang Im against the Siamese in1714 and continued to support Ang Im’s son, Ang
Chi, who was then reigning as king.
The Laotian community was centered along the Mekong River north of
Phnom Penh, west of modern Tay Ninh Province where Nguyen Cuu Chiem’s
private lands were. In1731, a leader of this community, seemingly without the
approval of Ang Chi, mobilized his followers, along with many Khmers, and
began to attack down the East Vam Co River toward Gia Dinh. Nguyen Cuu
Chiem successfully fended them off, but, after news of this arrived at Phu Xuan,
Truong Phuc Vinh was sent to take command of the situation. By the time he had
arrived, the Lao–Khmer forces had shifted to attack toward My Tho along the
West Vam Co River. Truong Phuc Vinh sent Nguyen Cuu Chiem and Chen
Dading to repulse them. Ang Chi, fearing reprisals, sent a letter of submission to
Truong Phuc Vinh and ceded the My Tho and Vinh Long regions to Phu Xuan.
Truong Phuc Vinh thereafter occupied himself with conscripting labor to open
lacquer plantations in Gia Dinh.
However, in the following year, the Laotians mobilized more attacks in the
Vinh Long and My Tho areas. Truong Phuc Vinh accused Ang Chi of supporting

the Laotians and prepared to attack up the Mekong River. Finding himself in an
impossible situation and learning of Truong Phuc Vinh’s desire for wealth, Ang
Chi sent a large sum of money to Truong Phuc Vinh as a bribe to stop any
military action against him. Truong Phuc Vinh accepted the bribe. He then
hoped to remove Chen Dading’s authority in My Tho and Vinh Long by
ordering him to attack while withdrawing his own forces back to Gia Dinh,
meanwhile reporting to Phu Xuan that Chen Dading had refused his order to
advance. Chen Dading’s advance up the Mekong gave Ang Chi an opportunity
to mobilize his Khmer followers and wipe out the Laotian“rebels.” But when he
learned of Truong Phuc Vinh’s treachery, Chen Dading went immediately to Phu
Xuan to plead his case. However, the influence of the Truong Phuc family was so
strong that he was summarily imprisoned. He died before Nguyen Cuu Chiem
was able to inform Nguyen Phuc Tru of Chen Dading’s innocence. Nguyen Cuu
Chiem was rewarded for uncovering the affair with land in Vinh Long, and
Truong Phuc Vinh was dismissed.
The formal annexation of the My Tho and Vinh Long territories was accom-
plished under somewhat odd circumstances. Ang Chi considered himself allied
with Phu Xuan against his rival, Srei Thoamareachea II, who was allied with
Siam. He was also allied with the Laotian community in Cambodia against Siam.
However, the Laotians proved to be a wild card and, for reasons unknown but
that may simply have been a lust for plunder, a certain Lao leader, called Sa Tot
in Vietnamese records, initiated a war with the Vietnamese. Under duress from
all sides, Ang Chi used what capital he had available in territorial claims and
treasure to forestall Vietnamese invasions until finding a chance to eliminate the
Laotians. Vietnamese authority had already extended into many areas of the My
Tho and Vinh Long regions. The events of1731 and 1732 resulted in making
official the penetration of Vietnamese settlement into the Mekong’s northerly
downriver territories.
Aside from these acquisitions on the Gia Dinh frontier, indications of adminis-
trative energy during Nguyen Phuc Tru’s years appear to have been aimed at
seeking an appearance of uniformity. For example, in1733 he ordered that
clocks be put in all administrative centers and coastal watch stations to coordin-
ate the timing of government activities and related events. The edict proclaiming
this innovation included a detailed description of the clocks that were to be used,
their manufacture, and their various functions.
Other innovations came early in Nguyen Phuc Tru’s rule. In1726, he issued
two edicts to instruct the people how to live proper, civilized lives. He empha-
sized the merit of his family in founding the country and the gratitude for this
that should encourage an industrious and productive spirit among the people.
Gambling, corrupt litigation, and efforts to avoid census takers and military

conscription were specifically forbidden. This appears to have been an exhort-
ation for human behaviour to be as correct, morally, as clocks could be in telling
time. Also in1726, a new system of administration was set up for jurisdictions
along the western upland frontier from the northern border all the way down to
the Mekong plain. It appears to have created an administrative border zone
between lowland Viets and uplanders and to have defined more clearly a bound-
ary between the two populations.
Nguyen Phuc Khoat, the first southern king
In1738, Nguyen Phuc Tru died and was succeeded by his25-year-old eldest son
Nguyen Phuc Khoat. He ruled for twenty-seven years during a time when the
Trinh were beset by vast, prolonged rebellions in the north and the southerners
annexed the remaining territories in the Mekong plain that would become
Vietnamese. He presided with vigor and imagination over the last era of peace
and prosperity for the southerners before the outbreak of the Thirty Years War.
He is most noted for claiming royal status, thereby casting aside any vestige of
subordination to the Le dynasty and openly affirming the political independence
of the south.
In 1744, after a series of auspicious signs and the ritual of his officials three
times requesting him to take the throne, Nguyen Phuc Khoat proclaimed himself
a king, issued a new seal inscribed with“King of the Realm,” and published an
edict announcing a“change to the new.” All of his predecessors were known by
the title of“duke” (quan cong). He was the first to be known as“king” (vuong).
There had been a well-known prophesy in the south that the Nguyen family
would“return to the royal capital” after eight generations. Nguyen Phuc Khoat
was in the eighth generation from Nguyen Hoang, and by making Phu Xuan a
royal capital he fulfilled this prophesy. The government offices at Phu Xuan
were, at least superficially, reorganized under the“Six Ministries” and the other
administrative units that had been used at Dong Kinh since the time of Le Tu
Thanh. The hierarchy of titles, clothing regulations for officials, court ritual, and
the provincial administrative system were all reformed to be in accord with what
were understood as royal practice. The only compromise with respect to com-
plete sovereignty was that official paperwork was still dated using Le dynasty
reign years to avoid diplomatic problems with the Qing imperial court. In1754,
a major project to construct palaces and gardens was initiated to make Phu Xuan
look more like a royal capital.
Nguyen Phuc Khoat continued the attention to education displayed by his
predecessors. In 1740, he revised the literary examinations. Success at the first

three of four levels of achievement, covering four-six distich prose,phu rhyming
prose, and a prose composition on classical texts, respectively, earned various tax
and corvée exemptions. The fourth and highest level required a dissertation in
response to a question about public policy and success at this level earned an
appointment at a provincial or district government office.
One of the graduates of this1740 examination was Nguyen Cu Trinh (1716–
1767). He became one the most famous scholar-officials during the time of
Nguyen Phuc Khoat. His ancestors had left Nghe An for the south in the early
sixteenth century. His father was Nguyen Dang De (1668–1727), a graduate of
the 1701 examination who had a distinguished career under Nguyen Phuc Chu
and authored the edicts on civilized behavior at the beginning of Nguyen Phuc
Tru’s rule. A cousin of Nguyen Cu Trinh, Nguyen Dang Thinh (1693–1755), a
graduate of the1721 exam, was known for his erudition, was entrusted with the
drafting of all edicts, and became the teacher of Nguyen Phuc Khoat. Nguyen Cu
Trinh’s exceptionally astute administrative work is an indication of the quality of
men who entered government through the educational system at this time, which
provides a partial explanation for the achievements of Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s
reign.
Nguyen Cu Trinh was known for good manners, which probably contributed
to his rapid rise at Phu Xuan. He already held a high court position when
Nguyen Phuc Khoat proclaimed himself king in1744.I n 1750, he was made
governor of Quang Ngai Province at a time when conditions there were in
disarray and government authority was in danger of unraveling. Since Nguyen
Phuc Khoat’s accession, the long southern coast and the Mekong plain gave
frequent cause for concern, despite initiatives to maintain communications and
to strengthen administration.
No sooner had Nguyen Phuc Tru died in1738 than a Siamese army expelled
Ang Chi, the pro-Vietnamese king of Cambodia, and reinstalled Srei Thoamar-
eachea II on the Khmer throne. Ang Chi fled to Gia Dinh. This was immediately
followed by a Khmer attack on Ha Tien. Mo Jiu, the governor of Ha Tien, had
died in1735 and had been replaced by his son, Mac Thien Tu (Chinese: Mo
Tianci; also known as Mo Tianxi, Vietnamese Mac Thien Tich;1710–1780).
Mac Thien Tu responded to the Khmer attack with such vigor that his men
outran their supplies, but his wife organized the wives of his men to bring up
supplies, which enabled him to decisively defeat the Khmers.
When Truong Phuc Vinh was discredited and dismissed in1632 as “controller”
with overall command in the Mekong region, a man named Nguyen Huu Doan
was appointed to replace him. Thereafter, Nguyen Huu Doan’s competent
leadership stabilized the Vietnamese position in the Mekong plain. In1741 he
established nine new storehouses in Gia Dinh as part of a general reorganization

of storehouses throughout the country that was designed to reduce the level of
corruption in storehouse administration. In1746, he sent soldiers to put down
an uprising among the Chams in Binh Thuan to the north. Shortly after this he
suppressed an attempt by Qing merchants to take over Bien Hoa. This was no
sooner settled than the Khmer monarchy fell open for contestation.
In 1747, the death of Srei Thoamareachea II provoked a new round of fighting
in the Mekong plain among his potential successors. Amidst this turmoil, a
Khmer army seized and plundered My Tho. Nguyen Huu Doan replied to this
with an advance up the Mekong River to the Khmer capital where he made Ang
Chi king, but Ang Chi was soon driven out and died shortly after. Eventually, a
son of Srei Thoamareachea II emerged as the new king, known as Chei Chéttha IV.
Nguyen Huu Doan was content to let matters calm down and concentrated on
establishing a system of roads and ferry crossings to facilitate communication
and transport in the Mekong plain. This became the southernmost extension of
the first land road with ferry crossings that was then being built from the
northern border to Gia Dinh.
All the problems that could be expected in frontier jurisdictions seem to have
accumulated with particular virulence in Quang Ngai. Although not very far
from Phu Xuan, and despite, or maybe because of, being commonly treated as a
backwater of Quang Nam, Vietnamese settlers in Quang Ngai had developed an
adversarial attitude toward government authority. Unlike neighboring provinces,
Quang Ngai had no easy access into the mountains, which stood, in the expres-
sion of the time, like a“stone wall” in the west. One particular mountain was
named “Stone Wall Mountain.” The province extended from north to south for
about one hundred kilometers, but the coastal plain was relatively narrow, on
average ten to fifteen kilometers wide, and the mountains were never out of sight.
Nguyen Cu Trinh’s report on the conditions he found in Quang Ngai when he
arrived in 1750 is a list of problems: corrupt officials; bullies and bandits
everywhere; poor communication; a sparse and scattered population; stubborn,
ungovernable people living in misery; soldiers living in neglect; and chronic
attacks from upland peoples, called“stone wall barbarians.” His analysis was
that the first priority was to take care of the soldiers and to improve the morale of
the people.
A year later, he submitted a follow-up report with a more detailed analysis of
the situation and with recommendations for improvement. He thought that
excessive taxes, legal fees levied by corrupt officials, and demands to provide
supplies for garrisons and to care for elephants were impoverishing the people in
the province. Local officials were busying themselves with raising money by
making arrests, conducting interrogations, and seeking bribes. He recommended
that taxes be collected by provincial authorities and thus taken out of the hands

of local magistrates; that magistrates be paid salaries and be promoted, demoted,
or dismissed based on evaluations of their honesty; that the large population of
vagabonds be sorted out to distinguish good people fleeing oppressive taxation
from troublemakers, and that those simply seeking a livelihood be allowed to
settle where they wished; and, finally, that people be required to carry identifica-
tion papers to clearly distinguish honest citizens from people wandering around
stealing chickens and horses and disturbing the peace.
Nguyen Cu Trinh was in Quang Ngai only three years. It is unknown to what
extent he was able to implement his recommendations, but he did considerably
improve conditions in the province. He brought available military forces to a
high level of training and, using both force and conciliation, ended the depreda-
tions of the“stone wall barbarians.” Beyond that, he composed a vernacular
work that could be performed on stage that was aimed at raising the morale of
the people in Quang Ngai and at giving them a vocabulary to increase their
cultural and political awareness. The work is a dialogue between a Buddhist
monk and a Buddhist nun calledSai Vai(Monk and Nun). It is an entertaining,
racy, and at times almost pornographic work in easily memorized six-eight
vernacular verse. It includes humorous critiques both of Buddhist meditational
practice and of Confucian ideas about good government and it ends with a
rallying cry against the“stone wall barbarians.” The Sai Vai was a brilliant
way to catch the attention of a dispirited population and give them a laugh while
providing an education in the rhetoric of civilized behavior and good govern-
ment. Another gift of Nguyen Cu Trinh to the people of Quang Ngai was a set of
poems praising the“ten most scenic places” in the province, which was a
traditional way of putting a locality on the literary map. It might be thought
that he pacified the province with theater and literature.
With his exceptional abilities, Nguyen Cu Trinh was given the most difficult
assignments. In early1753, he was sent to administer the northern border region.
This followed reports in1752 that corruption among officials there was causing
unrest among the people, which invited Trinh intervention. At that time, the
Trinh were requesting permission of Phu Xuan to move their armies through the
border region to attack a rebel Le prince who had taken refuge in Laos. Nguyen
Cu Trinh dismissed the corrupt officials, raised the level of vigilance on the
border, and wrote a reply to the Trinh denying their request. After only eight
months on the northern border he had settled matters there. He was immediately
reassigned to the southern frontier where turmoil in the Khmer royal family was
creating new opportunities.
Nguyen Cu Trinh was sent south to be Nguyen Huu Doan’s successor as
“controller” in the Mekong region, but the territory over which he was given
authority extended up the coast as far as Nha Trang to give him greater resources

for dealing with the Cambodian situation. There was supposedly a rumor that
Chei Chéttha IV, the king of Cambodia, was in league with the Trinh, and there
were suspicions that the border flap Nguyen Cu Trinh encountered in the north
was connected with events in Cambodia. The implausibility of this rumor may
suggest that it was recorded by way of justifying Nguyen Cu Trinh’s assignment,
but given the embattled view that the southerners had of both frontiers it is not
unlikely that such a rumor could easily have gained currency at that time.
Nguyen Phuc Khoat heard news of confusion at the Khmer capital and decided
to simply move in and overwhelm the contestants for power there. In late1753,
Nguyen Cu Trinh was ordered to Gia Dinh where he was to prepare an exped-
ition against Cambodia. In mid1754 he launched an attack upriver from My
Tho toward the Khmer capital. The Cham community in Cambodia found itself
in the middle of this campaign and rallied to Nguyen Cu Trinh, providing him
with scouts and guides. During the course of this campaign, which continued for
two years, a front-line Vietnamese general ordered the Chams to relocate, and
then, apparently seeing little value in protecting his“barbarian” allies, he with-
drew to My Tho as a Khmer army attacked the Cham refugees, numbering some
five thousand men and women. Nguyen Cu Trinh, alerted to the situation, came
to the rescue of the Chams and escorted them to safety, out of the battle zone to
the northwest of Saigon. He then replaced the apparently racist general with a
man who incorporated Cham soldiers into his vanguard and renewed the offen-
sive against the Khmers.
Chei Chéttha IV had been in the midst of murderous intrigues among the
Khmer princes and members of his court when the Vietnamese attack was
launched. He eventually fled to Ha Tien and found refuge with Mac Thien Tu.
In1756, Mac Thien Tu relayed a message from Chei Chéttha IV to Nguyen Cu
Trinh begging to submit and offering to pay tribute due for the preceding three
years and to hand over two Khmer territories along the two branches of the
Mekong River from the modern cities of Vinh Long and Can Tho upriver to the
vicinity of Chau Doc, on the modern Khmer–Viet border. Nguyen Phuc Khoat
was not inclined to accept this offer of submission from Chei Chéttha IV, not
believing that he would keep his word. Nguyen Cu Trinh then sent a letter to
Nguyen Phuc Khoat that reveals the quality of his thought:
We use military force to exterminate enemies and to expand our control
of territory. Now Chei Chéttha IV shows an attitude of repentance and
submission, and he offers us land. If we persist in doubting him, he will
surely run away and nothing will have been achieved. From Gia Dinh to
Phnom Penh the way is far and difficult with rivers and forests. It will not
be easy to run him down. If we want to expand our territory, we should
take the two places he offers to us before we do anything else, so that they

will definitely be ours. If we toss away what is near in search of what is
far, I fear that there will be difficulties that our soldiers cannot overcome.
Although it is easy to take territory, it is not so easy to truly hold it. In the
past, our occupation of these territories in this region has been slow, step-
by-step. In fact, the land we now occupy does not have enough settlers
and soldiers. The Chams are good soldiers and the Khmers fear them. We
should give the Chams land and support them, using barbarians against
barbarians. I recommend that we forgive Chei Chéttha IV, take the two
regions he has offered to us, inspect them, build fortifications, establish
garrisons, settle people, make a border, and soon we will have the whole
region.
Nguyen Phuc Khoat found nothing wrong with this argument and accordingly
made peace with Chei Chéttha IV.
One year later, in1757, Chei Chéttha IV died. Two men who endeavored to
succeed him were successively murdered. Vietnamese armies were again mobil-
ized to intervene. Once again, Mac Thien Tu provided the solution for settling
matters by proposing that a Khmer prince who had found refuge with him be
made king of Cambodia. Nguyen Phuc Khoat agreed to this on condition that all
remaining downriver Khmer territories, in the region of modern Tra Vinh and
Soc Trang, were to be ceded to the Vietnamese. On this basis, Nguyen Cu Trinh
and Mac Thien Tu marched to the Khmer capital and enthroned a grandson of
one of Chei Chéttha IV’s second cousins as Outeireachea III, who reigned
thereafter until1775. As part of the final settlement, Outeireachea III ceded more
territories along the borders of Ha Tien to Mac Thien Tu, who then passed them
along to Phu Xuan. With this, the Khmer–Viet border was drawn more or less as
it exists today.
Nguyen Cu Trinh remained in the south until1765. He and Mac Thien Tu
were well-educated men who became famous for their friendship. Both loved
poetry and Nguyen Cu Trinh contributed to an anthology of poems praising the
“ten most scenic places” in Ha Tien. Nguyen Cu Trinh’s leadership was a critical
factor in stabilizing a Khmer–Viet border that would thereafter stand the test of
time.
It was during Nguyen Cu Trinh’s service in the south, in1751, that envoys are
recorded from the“Water Chieftain” and the “Fire Chieftain” of the Central
Highlands in the vicinity of modern Buon Ma Thuot. Vietnamese historians
considered these men to be descendents of the Cham king defeated by Le Tu
Thanh in1471 and recorded tribute and trading relationships with them since
the time Phu Yen had been added to Vietnamese territory in the early seventeenth
century, for access to their lands was up the Da Rang River that flowed into the
sea at Phu Yen. According to southern annalists, Vietnamese traded silks, hats,

brass pots, iron pans, and ceramics for beeswax, deer antlers, bear gall, stallions,
and bull elephants. Trade with the Laotian kingdom via the Cam Lo Road west
from Quang Tri continued to be important as well. In1761, Laotian envoys
arrived in Phu Xuan to demonstrate their interest in maintaining this trade.
Information recorded in the time of Nguyen Phuc Khoat also gives details
about the maritime frontier. In1754, a Vietnamese ship on its way to the Hoang
Sa Islands (Paracel Islands) was blown off course by a storm and shipwrecked on
Hainan Island. Qing magistrates sent the survivors back to Phu Xuan, and
Nguyen Phuc Khoat wrote a letter of thanks to the Qing authorities. This episode
was the occasion for Vietnamese historians to record information about Viet-
namese activities on offshore islands. According to them, each year, since the
beginning of Nguyen rule in the south, around seventy people were assigned to
sail to the Hoang Sa Islands in the third lunar month to collect sea products and
to return in the eighth lunar month. The trip normally took three days each way.
The passage also mentions that Vietnamese regularly visited the Truong Sa
Islands (Spratley Islands), describing them as over130 islets, some with fresh
water, spread over a huge distance. The products collected from the islands
included shellfish, sea ginseng, tortoise shell, and many kinds of sea turtles.
However impressive the achievements of Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s reign may
appear, failure to find any solution to a deepening fiscal conundrum also char-
acterized his time. The basic problem was that the southern economy was
increasingly monetized just as money was increasingly scarce. This led to a shift
of coinage from copper to zinc, which led to inflation and the erosion of both the
private economy and government finances.
In the seventeenth century, trade with China and Japan produced an abun-
dance of copper coins, which met the needs of the economy. By the early
eighteenth century, however, this supply declined and the price of copper
rapidly rose relative to silver, which became more abundant from South America
via Manila. Chinese copper became expensive, and Japan began to limit the
export of copper coins in the early eighteenth century. The first indication of
this problem in the annals comes in1724 with an edict forbidding the casting of
tin, lead, or iron coins or the melting down of copper coins unless they were
chipped, cracked, or worn away. Apparently, not only were people melting
down copper coins because their actual value was higher than their face value,
but there was also private minting of non-copper coins. The edict appears to
have been an effort to maintain copper as legal tender despite the market forces
that were replacing copper with cheaper materials. In the following year, copper
coins were cast and distributed to soldiers. The annal explains that this was
necessary because people were melting down copper coins and making them
scarce.

The first indication of inflation comes from1741 when Nguyen Phuc Khoat
ordered an examination of tax receipts for rice and salt during the preceding
three years to see if the tax rate was correct in reference to expenses. It was at that
time that he became concerned about corruption in storehouses and instituted a
new system of control for storehouses to maintain stricter supervision of them
and to prevent officials from abusing their access to these sites of non-monetary
wealth. The scarcity of copper coinage finally led to the casting of zinc coins in
1746. These coins were one-third to half the weight of copper coins and their face
value was more than twice their real value. In1748, an edict prescribed punish-
ments for those refusing to use these new coins. Before long, private foundries
were producing as many of these coins as the government was supplying, and
inflation became a very serious matter. Indications of government efforts to keep
up with inflation are frequent in the1750s. In1753, Nguyen Phuc Khoat ordered
a calculation and analysis of revenues and expenditures during the preceding six
years. In1758, officials were sent to adjust tax rates in Phu Yen because revenue
from that province was not consistent with rising revenues from neighboring
jurisdictions; perhaps officials in Phu Yen were trying to benefit from inflation
while pretending it was not happening.
In 1755, custom duties on foreign ships were increased. European ships were
assessed at the highest rate. Ships from Macau and Japan were assessed at half the
European rate. Ships from Guangdong and Shanghai were assessed at three-
quarters the Macau and Japanese rate, and those from Fujian, Siam, and Manila
at two-thirds the Guangdong and Shanghai rate. The effect of inflation on foreign
trade was disastrous. Whereas in the1740s sixty to eighty foreign ships called at
Hoi An each year, by the early1770s the number was down at ten to fifteen.
The inflationary squeeze that developed during Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s time
tore the vitality out of the southern economy and, by the mid1760s, brought to
the verge of poverty a country that for the preceding two centuries had been
mostly prosperous. The failure to solve this economic crisis led to a collapse of
political leaderhip in the1760s that contributed to the outbreak of the Thirty
Years War. At the time of his death in1765, Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s designated
heir was his33-year-old second son, Nguyen Phuc Con. However, a member of
the powerful Truong Phuc family named Truong Phuc Loan, a brother of
Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s mother, had insinuated himself into an impregnable
position at court. Nguyen Phuc Con was imprisoned and killed as Truong Phuc
Loan brought to the throne Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s sixteenth son, 11-year-old
Nguyen Phuc Thuan. Truong Phuc Loan thereafter maintained power with an
entourage of homicidal sycophants. He was greedy for riches and spent much
time with food, wine, and women. However, he was an incompetent ruler, and it
was not long before the country began to drift into disorder.

In the Phu Xuan era, the southerners established a new country extending
from the Gianh River to the Gulf of Siam. The Nguyen Phuc family gradually
abandoned its pose of loyalty to a dynasty held hostage by its Trinh enemy. After
generations of acting as an independent monarchy, the Nguyen Phuc openly
claimed that status. Under Nguyen Phuc Khoat, Phu Xuan’s wealth and power
overwhelmed Cambodia, was felt among chieftains in the Central Highlands,
extended to the Laotian kingdom on the mid Mekong, and echoed across the sea.
That Phu Xuan was destined to collapse so suddenly within a few years of
Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s death was not foreseen by anyone during his lifetime.
The helplessness of the Nguyen Phuc family under the machinations of Truong
Phuc Loan is difficult to explain without an understanding of what can begin to
happen at a royal court suffering financial woes and where greed and intrigue
become the everyday style of life. By the1760s, Phu Xuan was not a garrison, or
the headquarters of a regional lord, or the center of administration for an
aspiring monarchy. It had become a royal court and was consequently the arena
of king-making ambitions modeled on the Trinh in the north. In1765, Truong
Phuc Loan aspired to be for the Nguyen Phuc what the Trinh were for the Le.
However, unlike the Trinh, he lacked a strong regional base from which to
dominate the rest of the country, and he was bereft of political acuity. His
adventure as lord of the palace did not last long.
Misgovernment in the north
In Samuel Baron’s words, written in the1680s and later published in London as
“A Description of the Kingdom of Tonqueen,”
the city of Ke Cho is the metropolis of Tonkin... and may, for its
capaciousness, be compared with many cities in Asia, and superior to
most for populousness, especially on the first and fifteenth day of their
new moon, being their market days... when the people from the adjacent
villages flock thither with their trade, in such numbers, as is almost
incredible; several of the streets, though broad and spacious, are then
so crowded that one finds enough to do if he can sometimes advance
through the multitude a hundred paces in half an hour.
The vernacular termke chomeans “people in the market.” Thang Long, Dong
Kinh, and other classical terms for the capital did not enjoy popular currency.
From at least the seventeenth century, the capital was known to the people who
lived there as Ke Cho, the place where large numbers of people gathered on the
bi-monthly market days.

In the seventeenth century, Europeans also knew the city as Ke Cho. The city
was no longer a royal capital of kings who ruled. Kings now sat powerless in the
solitude of their palaces while in a separate palace complex in the southern part
of the city sat the lords who ruled with their garrison of thousands of soldiers
from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. The reforms of the Vinh Tho and Canh Tri eras
(1658–1671) had brought men from the Red River plain into the government,
but their efforts to harness the agrarian resources of this potentially rich land
were ad hoc and constrained by the limitations of Trinh leadership.
The Trinh conundrum was that they dared not dispense with the Le dynasty
because it was in the name of that dynasty that they had been able to establish
relations with first the Ming and then the Qing Empires to the north. Further-
more, without the Le dynasty, the Trinh would have no credible claim over the
southerners. Even though efforts to enforce that claim had lapsed in the1670s,
the Trinh were not prepared to relinquish it altogether. But having to live with
the fuss and bother of a royal court that by its nature was a magnet for seditious
loyalties and a natural seedbed of opposition kept Trinh nerves stretched taut.
The Le court was a reminder of unfulfilled ambition and a threat of disloyalty
and insubordination. The Trinh and their supporters inhabited an institutional-
ized contradiction, which made it difficult to resist the lazy pleasures of enjoying
power and easy to avoid the headache of government. Trinh Tac’s successors
displayed a range of qualities and achievements, from flawed efforts to solve
problems to irresponsible self-indulgence.
While political and administrative life crept along in a shadow of perplexity,
the bi-monthly surge of people into and out of the city demonstrated the living,
pulsing energy of the country. Powerful eunuchs were able to put their hands on
the profits of foreign merchants, but the thousands of peasants and artisans who
regularly did business in the streets of Ke Cho inhabited another world where an
inattentive government fumbled and failed to find a grip. The entrepreneurial
energy expressed by these“people in the market” had its own tempo arising from
the aspirations of thousands of people inhabiting many hundreds of villages, and
government administrators could not keep pace with it. Trinh efforts to maintain
control of the Red River countryside without resorting to soldiers did not
succeed.
The lively international commerce of the early seventeenth century was in steep
decline by the1670s. With the end of their wars against the Nguyen and the
Mac, the Trinh interest in foreign trade faded. The Dutch began to lose money
and in1671 abandoned their formerly lucrative shipments of silk directly to
Japan and thereafter sent all their Tonkin trade to Batavia to be reshipped from
there. The English arrived in1672 and competed with the Dutch for what was
left of the market. In the1680s and1690s, Trinh Can badgered the Dutch for

difficult-to-obtain gifts, sometimes confiscated their property or imprisoned
them, and insisted that they continue to buy raw silk that was no longer in
demand anywhere. The English never made any profits in Tonkin and finally left
in1697. Even Chinese merchants were departing in large numbers during these
years. The Dutch finally sailed away, never to return, in1700.
The French appeared in the late1660s and for several years maintained a
residence at Pho Hien. However, this was not a commercial venture so much as a
new missionary initiative. The Jesuits were expelled in1663 during the Con-
fucianizing exuberance of the Canh Tri period. The Paris Society of Foreign
Missions had been established in the1650s with Papal blessing as a French-led
alternative to the Jesuits, whose activities in Asia, with their headquarters in
Macau, were dependent upon Portuguese transport and tended to operate within
the confines of Portuguese interests. Alexandre de Rhodes, as much French as he
was Jesuit, had a role in initiating this new organization. The Paris Society was
comprised of“secular” priests, not members of religious orders such as the
Jesuits, Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians who had pioneered Christian
proselytization in Asia. The Society ostensibly aimed to train native clergy to be
under the direct guidance of Rome rather than to be partisans of any particular
religious order. Yet, the Society lent itself to Asian adventures sponsored by the
French crown, particularly in Siam, where a scheme to convert the monarchy led
to a short-lived French military intervention in the1680s.
In Tonkin, the Society began its operations clandestinely in collaboration with
the newly formed French East India Company. Once the missionaries of the
Society discovered that they were able to operate among the Vietnamese under
these conditions, the Jesuits returned via Macau, and soon Dominicans also
arrived from Manila. This new wave of European missionaries established contact
with the Vietnamese Christian communities that had grown up under Jesuit
tutelage in earlier decades. Despite initial tension between Vietnamese Christian
leaders who favored different groups of missionaries, and despite disputes
between the Jesuits and the Society about how best to train a native clergy, and,
also, despite periodic persecutions of Christians by Vietnamese authorities, the
Christian missionary effort spread through the villages of the Red River plain. By
the time of Trinh Can’s death in1709, forty-seven European missionaries are
recorded as having gone to serve in Tonkin: eighteen Jesuits, fourteen members of
the Society, ten Dominicans, one Augustinian, and four others. During the same
time, the missionaries of the Society ordained twenty-eight native priests and the
Jesuits ordained four. The Society and the various religious orders were also
conducting missionary work in the south at a similar level of activity.
Trinh Can’s date of birth is unknown, but he was most probably born in
the 1620s. He had spent25 years as his father’s right-hand man. During the

27 years that he ruled after the death of Trinh Tac, he showed himself to be
secretive, scheming, greedy, reliant upon a small circle of cronies, passive, and
unimaginative. He was already an old man at this time. He outlived three
designated heirs and was finally succeeded by a great grandson. His years in
power were filled with cyclic recurrences of the“same old” problems: drought,
flood, and famine; border disputes with Qing; corruption in the examination
halls; confusion in the courts of law; and bitter feuds among his officials.
Whatever Vinh Tho and Canh Tri administrators had achieved with regard to
agrarian affairs in the late1650s and early 1660s was lost amidst recurring
disasters beginning in the early1680s. Dikes broke with distressing frequency.
Famine was endemic. Europeans reported outbreaks of cannibalism. In1694,
Trinh soldiers attacked and destroyed an entire village after it had become a
major center of brigandage that threatened communication between the capital
and Thanh Hoa. Officials were sent to investigate“the misery of the people” but
without any indication of action taken to alleviate the situation. Inspectors were
repeatedly sent out to the provinces to clean up courts of law that had become
“clogged” with unresolved litigation. Routine exhortations for officials to be
honest were repeated again and again. Regional examinations were famous for
chaos and corruption, and in1696 there was a major scandal in the capital exam
despite repeated efforts to“reform” the system. In the same year, the proscrip-
tion of Christianity was reaffirmed while noting that during the preceding thirty-
three years it had had no effect. Qing immigrants were spreading their style of
dress and haircut among the people, so this was forbidden. A form of gambling
became such a rage that it was forbidden. Officials who refused to serve under
the supervision of eunuchs were summarily dismissed. Negotiations with Qing
over border issues were entangled in the politics of Trinh Can’s court. In two
separate cases, honest officials who had been dismissed arbitrarily or as a result
of being on the losing side of a feud among officials turned to teaching and
established reputations for producing many famous students.
One of Trinh Can’s especial favorites was Le Hy, the scholar who supervised
completion of the court history published in1697. Le Hy was also a corrupt man
who did not shrink from homicide in his feuds with other officials. In1696 he
obtained the death of an official with whom he had nurtured enmity and who
had sabotaged a scheme for Le Hy’s son to cheat on a regional exam. Described
as cunning and naturally suspicious of others, Le Hy was a specialist in false
accusations that derailed the careers of his enemies. A popular saying was
recorded that went:“The greedy chant prayers to Le Hy; the whole world is as
sad as can be.”
When Le Hy died in1702, some of his enemies managed to regain positions at
the Trinh court. One of these was Nguyen Quan Nho (1638–1709), a Canh Tri

graduate who retained some of the idealism of those years. Returning to the
capital from his home in Thanh Hoa, he reported to Trinh Can that not only was
Thanh Hoa suffering from famine but also that military commanders there were
abusive and oppressive. He appealed for more enlightened policies toward the
common people. Trinh Can listened to him.
Trinh Can’s designated heir, a grandson, died in the following year, and
Nguyen Quan Nho along with other officials of his ilk prevailed upon Trinh
Can to elevate an18-year-old great grandson, Trinh Cuong, to be his heir. This
provoked resistance among the eunuchs and generals, who turned to their allies
within the Trinh family. In1704, two grandsons of Trinh Can, sons of an earlier
but deceased heir, were executed after plotting a coup against Trinh Cuong.
Resistance to Trinh Cuong from Trinh kinsmen continued for several years. The
contention over Trinh Cuong’s appointment may have also spread to the royal
family, which could explain why, in1705, Trinh Can deposed the45-year-old
king, Le Duy Cap, and replaced him with his26-year-old son, Le Duy Duong.
Trinh Cuong’s reforms
When Trinh Can died in1709, Trinh Cuong, then24 years old, came to power
surrounded by men keen to reform the government. One of Trinh Cuong’s first
acts was to reissue“the six teachings” that had been promulgated in the late
1670s, just before Trinh Tac’s death: (1) great lords must not rely upon coercion
to have their way; (2) military officers must constantly train and drill their men
and must not be heartless and cruel toward the people; (3) civil officials must be
honest and industrious; (4) court ministers must be loyal and without guile;
(5) soldiers must follow orders; (6) the people must do their best to know the
difference between right and wrong. These“teachings” were an echo of the
idealism of the Hong Duc and Canh Tri eras. That they were again announced
at this time is an indication that the undesirable behaviors they addressed were
still very much in evidence. The small quiver of idealism expressed in Trinh
Cuong’s accession to power and reflected in the recycling of these“teachings”
was probably based on Trinh Cuong’s susceptibility to the influence of a group
of officials inclined toward the rhetoric of good government. These officials
apparently found their step up into power in alliance with Trinh Cuong’s
mother, a woman who had achieved high status among the palace women.
Trinh Cuong’s twenty years of rule displayed a flurry of legislation aimed at
the country’s problems. Yet, the disconnection between government authority
and a population in distress paradoxically increased. The literati families in the
Red River plain that had been mobilized by Trinh Tac, with a few notable

exeptions, simply added a new level of corruption and oppression between the
Trinh regime and village agriculturalists. Trinh Cuong’s reforms produced little
more than opportunities for new forms of abuse. Meanwhile, rural impoverish-
ment continued unabated while Trinh treatment of the Le kings eroded the moral
authority of the regime.
If one were to take at face value the busy concern with which Trinh Cuong and
his small circle of advisors appeared to have addressed government affairs, it
would seem to have been a time of relatively enlightened rule motivated by strong
feelings of benevolence toward the common people. Trinh Cuong was an intelli-
gent man who appears to have taken to heart the task of sorting out the mess in
which he found the country. However, he and his advisors found no way to
translate ostensibly good intentions into real achievements. Whatever they tried
to do got lost somewhere between plan and implementation. Furthermore, the
gap that had always existed between the Trinh regime and the people of the Red
River plain, instead of being mended, was being filled by a new class of locally
produced rapacious officials and“notables.” Beneath the veneer of fine rhetoric
and legislative activism, the regime continued down the path of corruption,
factional intrigue, and virulently oppressive taxation. Trinh Cuong’s reputation
as a reformer has been enhanced among historians by comparison with the
disasters that followed.
Trinh Cuong’s closest advisors were Le Anh Tuan (1671–1734), a graduate of
1694, and Nguyen Cong Hang (1680–1732), a graduate of1700. Both were
from localities near the capital. They had supported Trinh Cuong’s elevation
during Trinh Can’s final years. According to an anecdote, Trinh Cuong was in
the habit of summoning these men in the dead of night to discuss problems and
policies over tea. However, their ideas did not fare well in the light of day. They
were the architects of Trinh Cuong’s reforms. They also found ways to abuse
their power and made many enemies. After Trinh Cuong’s death, they met
untimely ends when their enemies were ascendant.
Trinh Cuong’s reforms were not entirely hollow. They did have an effect on
the country, even if not what was apparently intended, and they became a point
of reference for legislative initiatives later in the century. Furthermore, they
concentrated on the most intractable sector of Trinh government: land tenure
and rural taxation. A detailed look at these measures reveals why Trinh Cuong’s
so-called reforms were unsuccessful. It was a case of palace theory encountering
the stubborn reality of a countryside where an ineffective central authority had to
compromise every measure with the most predatory elements of rural society.
The breakdown of dikes and devastating floods had become common in Trinh
Can’s later years. Consequently, one of the first measures taken by Trinh Cuong
was to take the responsibility for dike maintenance out of the hands of provincial
344 / A history of the Vietnamese

officials and to centralize the supervision of dikes from the capital. While this
was intended to eliminate provincial corruption of dike management, it was no
guarantee against corruption at the central government level. Furthermore, this
removed supervisory responsibility from people closest to the dikes and placed it
in hands at some distance away. This measure does not seem to have significantly
affected the frequency of dike breaches, even for dikes in the immediate vicinity
of the capital. Just a few months before Trinh Cuong’s death in1729, there were
serious dike failures with floods along the Red River. Floodwaters broke through
a dike directly across the river from Ke Cho, washing away a palace that Trinh
Cuong had built for his mother only two years before. In1725, the collapse of
dikes in Hai Duong, east of the capital, had produced the unusual calamity of
seawater invading the rice fields. The example of dike management is an indica-
tion of the quality of Trinh Cuong’s reforms. They did not improve adminis-
tration so much as reallocate opportunities for the personal enrichment of
officials.
Famines are recorded in1713, 1721, 1724, 1726, and1728.I n1721, famine
created such panic in the capital that special police units were deployed to keep
order in the streets as dying peasants invaded the capital. In1715, an epidemic
ravaged Nghe An, prompting authorities to make prayers to Buddha for deliver-
ance. Missionary accounts from this time attest to the utter misery of the rural
population. Farmers lived on the edge of starvation. Taxation and conscription
pushed large numbers of people to flee, leaving empty villages and abandoned
fields. Wealthy notables and predatory mandarins accumulated land. Trinh
Cuong spent vast sums on new palaces and gardens. His eunuchs were every-
where seeking ways to fill their pockets.
In 1711, Trinh Cuong’s advisors noted the basic outline of the rural problem.
Powerful families had accumulated land into big estates worked by fugitives and
refugees who thereby had escaped from village tax and conscription registers.
Many villages stood deserted, and a large part of the rural population had
disappeared from administrative oversight. There was no prospect of changing
the general dynamic of this situation. Trinh Cuong’s advisors understood that
they could not stop people from leaving their villages and seeking their liveli-
hoods elsewhere. All they could propose was that when people did move to
another place they were supposed to register with the authorities in that place to
be included in the rolls for taxation and conscription.
They were also concerned about the common fields that were meant to
support landless widows and widowers, childless elderly people, the disabled,
and soldiers. There was a perception that village common fields were not being
allocated properly, so Trinh Cuong’s advisors proposed to conduct a survey of
these fields every six years to make sure that they were sufficient to meet the

demands placed on them. The main concern here, however, was not with the
landless, the elderly, or the disabled, but with the soldiers, and the soldiers in
question were men from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An who were garrisoned in the
Red River plain. Men in the Red River plain were conscripted as soldiers in times
of emergency or for periodic training, or for rotational duty in the northern
border provinces, but they were not maintained as part of the regular, standing
military force in the lowlands. In1722, this was changed, and men from the Red
River plain were integrated into the regular standing army. As part of this new
scheme, the common fields in the villages of the Red River plain were reassigned
for the support of soldiers from the Red River plain. Although this provided
some temporary relief to local populations that no longer had to allocate land to
support soldiers from other provinces, in the long term it created a new class of
villagers with military training who would turn against the Trinh during the
rebellions that broke out in the1730s.
A common means by which local officials accumulated wealth at the expense
of villagers was through litigation in courts of law that resulted in the penalty of
confiscation, either of land or of other forms of property. The abuses of this
procedure had been entrenched in village life for centuries, but they had reached
such a level of virulence that Trinh Cuong’s advisors took note of them in1715
by ordering a triennial inspection of confiscations to ensure that they were
appropriate, not too much or too little. This measure neither ended the practice
nor did it ensure an end to abuse. It simply brought the central authorities into
the picture and gave them opportunities to participate in managing this method
of transferring wealth from villagers to government officials.
In 1716, Trinh Cuong’s advisors began to discuss what to do about the Stabil-
ization Act that had been implemented in the1660s by the Canh Tri reformers to
fix a final, definitive survey of village land ownership as the basis for taxation. This
survey, made when there was little difference between landowners and village
populations, produced a set of census registers that were also used for the con-
scription of laborers and soldiers when needed. Since the brunt of military service
was borne by men from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, the conscription of men from
the Red River plain was not a high priority for routine administration and could be
accomplished when needed on an ad hoc basis. However, by the time of Trinh
Cuong, this was changing, and the idea of incorporating men from the Red River
plain into the regular standing army was growing. In order to accomplish this, an
up-to-date census of village populations would have to be taken. The first step in
the minds of Trinh Cuong’s advisors was to distinguish between surveys of land
ownership and census registers. They regarded these as different issues and began
to make plans for both a survey of land ownership and a census of the population
as separate procedures.

The record of land ownership that had been produced by the Stabilization Act
was absurdly out of date, which increasingly distorted the tax burden. Villages
were taxed according to rates that had been calculated half a century earlier. This
was not a problem for villages that had grown or become wealthier, but, for the
more typical villages that had fallen on difficult times and seen much of their land
go into the untaxed hands of powerful families, this made their tax burden
oppressively out of proportion to available resources. Meanwhile, rich land-
owners were not bearing an equitable share of the tax burden. In1619, a field
survey to record land ownership for purposes of taxation was ordered so that
“the rich will bear their proportional share of the tax burden and the poor will
not be oppressed.” But a survey of land ownership would not help to administer
labor and military conscription or the head tax and the public service fees levied
to support local shrines, temples, dikes, bridges, storehouses, and examination
halls, so in1722 the first of what were to be triennial censuses was taken.
The census of1722 resulted in a redrawing of the administrative maps and
became the basis for the new system of conscripting soldiers from the Red River
plain into the standing army. It was also the basis for new tax legislation
announced in1723, which was supposedly based on the“Tang dynasty model.”
The main source for field taxes was on the common lands that were mostly
apportioned to the families of men serving on active military duty. Private land
was taxed at less than half the rate of common land, and the private land of
officials was exempt from taxation altogether. The head tax, which in the past had
been levied according to a schedule of variable rates, was simplified to a fixed rate
for all men eligible for military service, with students and the elderly paying half
the regular rate. The public service fees were likewise simplified to a fixed rate to be
paid by all men eligible for military service. Fields were designated for the support
of schools. Furthermore, a school tax was added to the head tax in the Red River
plain and to the public service fee in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An; the school tax in
Nghe An was half that in the Red River plain, and in Thanh Hoa it was less yet
than that. Other innovations to the tax system were duties on the sale of cinnamon
bark and of bronze. Inspection stations on the rivers taxed boats at therate of one-
fortieth the value of merchandise they carried. A special tax scheme was estab-
lished for salt makers, who were exempt from regular taxation.
The new tax policy was modified as soon as it encountered reality. In1724,t h e
head tax was abolished in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, and the land tax rates in
those provinces were reduced by half. In the Red River plain, the schedule of tax
rates was reduced“in accordance with local conditions.” When a drought ruined
the rice harvest, taxes were reduced even further. In an effort to find newsources of
revenue, a survey was ordered of land that had appeared as a result of changes in
the courses of rivers, and a new tax was levied on the sale of fruits and vegetables.

Plans were made for the second triennial census in1725, but this census apparently
never materialized as problems overwhelmed Trinh Cuong’s advisors.
In 1725, all unpaid taxes were forgiven and Nguyen Cong Hang was assigned
to personally tour the countryside to sort out the mess. The survey of fields had
produced a great snarl of disputes over ownership of land and over access to
water that was made available from dikes and dams. The policy of conscripting
soldiers from the Red River plain into the regular army resulted in large numbers
of men fleeing their villages to avoid military service. The only government
initiative recorded this year was to issue rules on how much property various
grades of officials were allowed to possess, which gave the Trinh regime an
opportunity to appropriate what it decided was the excess property of officials,
basically skimming off its share of what local authorities had acquired. The
regime also issued an invitation to villagers to speak up in praise or blame of
local magistrates, thus acknowledging a certain concern about popular opinion.
Thereafter, the initiatives taken to survey land ownership and to establish a
system of taxation were overwhelmed by the poverty of rural life and by the
culture of corruption that had become endemic to officialdom. In1727, new
rules for collecting taxes were published. It is unclear what exactly they were, but
they were ostensibly meant to remedy the“chaos” of existing practice. In1728,
the rate of taxation on land was increased, and there were new rules for allotting
common land to the families of soldiers. Trinh Cuong died the following year
without having solved the agrarian problems that seemed to occupy so much of
his advisors’attention.
Trinh Cuong ’s advisors also made innovations in education and the
examination system during the1720s. The curriculum for military examinations
was published in1721. Designed to produce officers, it included the study of
Sunzi, an ancient author on“the art of war,” and the demonstration of skill in
horsemanship, in the use of shield and sword, and in handling knives. The focus
of concern about literary examinations was directed at the regional exams and
the procedure for students to gain access to regional exams. The same questions
were being used in regional exams year after year and were well known to
students, so in1711 officials were directed to change the questions for each
exam. But this did not end the chicanery. In 1720, the setting of regional
examination questions was taken out of the hands of provincial officials
altogether and was thereafter to be done in the capital. In1722, new regulations
for the conduct of regional examinations were issued. The most significant
departure from previous practice had to do with the pre-exams that determined
the eligibility of students to advance to the provincial-level regional exams.
Pre-exams had previously been held at the village level under the supervision of
district magistrates, but they were now to be conducted at the district level under

the supervision of provincial education officers. One effect was that the quotas
for students who could pass were now set at the district level rather than at the
village level, so whereas before every village could theoretically be represented at
the regional exam, this was no longer the case, and there was greater opportunity
for notoriously corrupt provincial education officials to determine the results.
Another innovation was that, while those who passed the pre-exams had before
been sorted into two categories of achievement,“completely good,” and “less
good,” with the“less good” having to wait for the next regional exam, now a
third intermediate category of“rather good” was inserted into the scheme and
allowed to advance directly to the regional exam. There were two effects of this.
One was that the“rather good” category became a fast track for favorite
candidates of education officials and the other was that large numbers of aspiring
students began to collect in the“less good” category, waiting for their chance to
advance to the regional exam. The abuses occasioned by the“rather good” track
led to this category being abolished in1741, but in1750 it was reinstituted to
normalize a growing practice of people buying their way into the regional exam.
The principal administrative innovation of this time was the institution in1718 of
the Six Sessions (Luc Phien). There had been up to three sessions prior to this, but
they were simply part of the Trinh military command structure and were in charge
of handling the finances of the land army, the naval forces, and the headquarters.
Now, sessions directly under the authority of the Trinh lord were established as part
of the civil government to handle the finances of each of the Six Ministries (LucBo).
In practice, the Six Sessions took over the functions of the Six Ministries, although
the Six Ministries continued to exist with certain appellate duties, at leastin theory.
In practice, the Six Sessions were a new level of authority over the entire system of
government located at the“court” of the Trinh lord. This authority was based upon
the control of revenue. This may appear to have tightened the chain of command
from the Trinh lord to the various offices of government, but it also inserted another
layer of officialdom at the top of the system that offered excellent opportunities to
favored officials for cultivating power and for personal enrichment. At thesame
time, another layer of fiscal administration was added with the formation ofthe Six
Treasuries (Luc Cung). The flow of tax revenue was redirected from the Ministryof
Finance to the Six Treasuries, which were attached to the Six Sessions. While the
creation of the Six Sessions and Six Treasuries may superficially appear to have been
a means for the Trinh lord to centralize his control over the government, italso
opened the stream of tax revenues to the hands of more officials in the lord’si n n e r
circle of favorites.
The formation of the Six Sessions and the Six Treasuries was shortly followed,
in 1720, by a reform in the hierarchy of appointments, ostensibly modeled on
the Hong Duc official registry, although, in the words of the annalist,“the

importance of positions was not the same.” At the time of this reform, the group
of officials closest to Trinh Cuong were recognized for their service during the
preceding ten years. Nguyen Cong Hang and Le Anh Tuan, along with three
others, were given top honors. Nine men received lesser awards. The adminis-
trative innovations of1718 were apparently related to the ascendance of this
group of officials. Pensions for retired officials were also established at this time.
Two years later, a new set of regulations for making appointments to govern-
ment offices was published.
Most of the reforming zeal of these years was directed at organizing access to
public revenues. Other aspects of government, for example the administration of
justice, were ignored. In1723, following a routine established in the time of
Trinh Can, officials were sent out to clear up the backlog of litigation in the
provinces. This was yet another opportunity for squeezing money into official-
dom through fees, fines, and confiscations.
The first peacetime conscription of soldiers from the Red River plain was
initiated in1721. In the following year, these men were integrated into regular
military units along with men from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. Among other
things, this was part of an effort to remove the army from the politics of the
Trinh family. In1722, Trinh Cuong began to retire members of the Trinh family
out of military positions because he did not want disaffected kinsmen with
military commands. He was also worried about problems on the Qing border
and felt the need to bring the manpower of the Red River plain into the equation
of frontier security. In1724, soldiers from the northern jurisdictions of the plain
began to be rotated for service in Cao Bang. In1726, at a time of unrest in Cao
Bang, ten thousand freshly recruited men from the Red River plain were mobil-
ized to the capital for training and drill.
Security issues on the northern border were a chronic source of concern. In
1714, a campaign against pirates along the coastal border with Qing was
launched. In 1715, Nguyen Cong Hang went to Cao Bang to deal with unrest
occasioned by someone claiming to be a descendent of the Mac. In1717, the
large numbers of men from Qing gathering in the northern mountains to work in
the gold, silver, copper, zinc, and iron mines so worried Trinh Cuong that he
decreed their number should be limited to three hundred. Vietnamese officials
resisted taking assignments in the northern border provinces. Those appointed to
serve there were in the habit of staying in the capital and pretending to fulfill their
duties at a distance. In1712, Trinh Cuong forced officials appointed to the
northern border provinces to actually go there. These officials then apparently
discovered the opportunities for personal enrichment available in these relatively
remote but productive regions. Their style of administration resulted in large
numbers of people fleeing across the border to live under the Qing. When this

became apparent in1720, Trinh Cuong decided there were too many officials in
the border provinces and ordered that their number be reduced.
One year earlier, Trinh Cuong reportedly had become concerned about the
quality of officials in the provinces and issued an edict charging them with five
priorities: suppression of bandits, prosecution of criminals, repair of dikes and
roads, vigilance at border gates, and maintenance of military discipline. Add-
itional charges were issued specifically for Cao Bang that included border defense
and keeping in readiness post stations for sending dispatches. None of these
priorities had anything directly to do with governing the people.
The only indication of interest in moral behavior comes from an edict in1720
exhorting students to learn propriety, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness;
forbidding marriage among people in the same family; forbidding clothing and
material possessions beyond one’s station in life, evil habits that wasted one’s assets,
superstitious practices, and a lazy playboy lifestyle; and advocating moderation and
thriftiness. It appears that this exhortation was aimed at people seeking to enter
officialdom through the examination system and not at the population in general.
The qualities featured in this exhortation are primarily about how one appearsin
society and indicate a certain bottom line for maintaining a plausible public
reputation.
Despite his seeming susceptibility to a group of scholars, Trinh Cuong also
made use of eunuchs, sending them to govern provinces and to supervise building
projects, among other assignments. He was also impervious to the opinions of his
literati advisors when dealing with the issue of succession in both the Trinh and
the Le families. In1727, Trinh Cuong named his eldest son Trinh Giang as his
heir, despite Nguyen Cong Hang and Le Anh Tuan arguing that Trinh Giang was
stupid and unequal to the task of governing the country. In the same year, he also
demoted the Le crown prince, Le Duy Tuong, whose mother was not from the
Trinh family, and replaced him with a younger brother, Le Duy Phuong, whose
mother was a Trinh woman. Then, in1729, shortly before he died, Trinh Cuong
forced the king, Le Duy Duong, to abdicate in favor of Le Duy Phuong. So, Trinh
Cuong left an heir who lacked the confidence of his closest advisors and a royal
family with an upstart king and a recently deposed king and crown prince.
Trinh Giang and the collapse of government
During the early years of Trinh Giang’s rule, the literati enemies of Nguyen Cong
Hang and Le Anh Tuan gradually gained influence amidst chaotic efforts to deal
with a deepening agrarian crisis. The first question Trinh Giang had for his
officials in1730 was to explain why tax revenues were decreasing. The answer

was that impoverished peasants were wandering away from their villages to
escape taxation, causing unpaid back taxes to accumulate. Officials counted
527villages that had been deserted. Two solutions to this problem were pro-
posed. One was simply to find ways of moderating the tax burden. To this end,
the head tax was abolished in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, and it was reduced in
the Red River plain for people who provided labor for maintaining the dikes. The
tax on private land was reduced, and customs stations on the rivers were
abolished except for two at the capital. Furthermore, the triennial census, which
was the basis for the head tax and public service fees, was rescheduled for twelve-
year intervals, thus putting into the relatively distant future any revision for this
source of popular aggravation.
The other solution was to compel people to return to the villages where they
were registered and pay their taxes there. An idea here was that people who had
left their villages to escape taxation were doing financially better than those who
remained at home, and so they should accordingly pay their tax at a higher rate.
Villages whose people went back to pay their taxes were rewarded, while villages
whose people did not go back were punished. Nguyen Cong Hang was put in
charge of a group of officials sent out to implement this plan to reconcentrate
people in their home villages. The results of this were not recorded, but it is
unlikely to have been very successful, if at all. Just at this time the dikes downriver
from the capital broke and a devastating flood inundated nine districts.
In 1731, an official from the coastal region of the Red River plain (modern
Thai Binh Province) named Bui Si Tiem (b.1690) submitted a ten-point analysis
of what was wrong in the country. It so infuriated Trinh Giang that Bui Si Tiem
was dismissed and sent back to his home village. It nevertheless offers a glimpse
into how one man viewed the situation. Le Duy Duong, the king that Trinh
Cuong had forced to abdicate two years earlier, had just died, and Bui Si Tiem
claimed that the manner in which he had been treated had damaged public
morale. Another point was the need to reform the education and examination
system to select men who could think and not just memorize passages. Several
points had to do with officialdom. There were too many officials for too few
people, and they were ignorant of how people lived, corrupt, hungry for bribes,
oppressive, and abusive. Taxation was too heavy, and the administration of
conscription for labor and military service caused unnecessary misery. Finally,
there was a lack of supervision over foreign workers in the mines of the northern
mountains. This last point implies that Qing miners were in some way contrib-
uting to the mood of popular disaffection as well as compromising the border.
In 1732, Nguyen Hieu (1674–1735), from Thanh Hoa and an examination
graduate of 1700, emerged as Trinh Giang’s principal advisor. Nguyen Cong
Hang and Le Anh Tuan were exiled to posts in the mountains. Nguyen Cong

Hang was killed almost immediately. Le Anh Tuan was killed two years later. In
addition to this coup at the top of officialdom, there was another intervention
into the royal family. The king, Le Duy Phuong, was deposed and replaced with
his elder brother, Le Duy Tuong. When Le Duy Tuong died three years later, Le
Duy Phuong was killed, and a younger brother named Le Duy Thin was made
king. Le Duy Thin was a cousin of Trinh Giang on his mother’s side and the
eleventh son of Le Duy Duong. The only substantive administrative act this year
was to abolish all taxes on“earth products” such as tin, iron, lumber, lacquer,
silk, tea, flowers, salt, fish, and shrimp, ostensibly because the taxes on these
items were causing people to stop supplying them.
Strangely enough, in this year Trinh Giang imagined that the kingdom was in
such a state of peace and prosperity that music was needed to celebrate. He
began to have musicians accompany him wherever he went through the streets,
playing the music of Ming and Qing composers. On the other hand, a traveler at
an inn in Bat Trang, a village specializing in ceramics a short distance downriver
from Ke Cho, thoughtlessly tossed a torch into a hole in the ground, causing the
eruption of a huge flame that burned for a month. This gave rise to a rumor of
imminent war that spread throughout the country.
In 1733, following the recommendation of Nguyen Hieu, the policy of con-
scripting soldiers for the regular army from the Red River plain was discon-
tinued. Nguyen Hieu, perhaps reflecting the prejudice of his home province,
Thanh Hoa, claimed that the men recruited from the Red River plain were poor
soldiers, being mainly orphans and youths who loitered around the markets, and
that the cost of maintaining them was too high. He was particularly opposed to
the policy established ten years earlier of allotting to them common land, which
he argued brought misery to villagers. Three years later, all men from the Red
River plain serving in the army were dismissed, and the regime went back to
relying on their levies from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. One effect of this was to
fill the villages of the Red River plain with men who had learned military drills
and had been trained in the use of weapons.
In 1735, Nguyen Hieu died while trying to adjust taxes in villages where the
population had scattered from floodwaters when the dikes again broke down-
river from the capital. Thereafter, eunuchs gained dominance over Trinh Giang
under the leadership of Hoang Cong Phu, who did not shrink from homicide to
eliminate rivals and to advance his allies. In1736, as an epidemic spread death
through the countryside, Hoang Cong Phu instituted the practice of selling
appointments in officialdom as a means of raising money. Trinh Giang was busy
building temples and improving the roads and dikes in his mother’s home
district, several kilometers east of Ke Cho. The transport of lumber and stone
from Thanh Hoa kept large numbers of farmers from working their fields.

In 1736 Hoang Cong Phu persuaded Trinh Giang to change the traditional
location of the palace examination from the king’s palace to his own. He then
manipulated the results to give unusually high honors to Trinh Tue (b.1704), a
protégé of his who was a member of the branch of the Trinh family that had
remained in Thanh Hoa. Trinh Tue thereafter received high appointments and
was a loyal ally of Hoang Cong Phu. The appointment of military men to high
civil positions in1737 provoked dismay and laughter, but more serious than this
was that the northern border provinces began to pull away from Trinh authority,
that bands of bandits began to“swarm up like bees” across the countryside, and
that a ragged army of peasants from the upper plains gathered on Mount Tam
Dao, about fifty kilometers north of the capital, where they gave battle to Trinh
army units.
People began to bury their valuables and to hoard food. Inhabitants of the
capital fled into the countryside. More ominous still was that, in1738, Le Duy
Mat (d.1770), a brother of the king, along with several other Le princes and a
group of disaffected officials, failing in a plot to unseat the Trinh, fled to the
uplands of Thanh Hoa and raised the flag of revolt. The effect of this was like a
signal igniting insurrection nearly everywhere. What followed was a year in
which the eunuchs, led by Hoang Cong Phu, endeavored to use the crisis to
advance their power, while Trinh efforts to raise solders gave fresh impetus
to rebellion. And then, Trinh Giang, at his wit’s end while looking for ways to
subdue the rebels, suffered a nervous breakdown.
In 1739, the status of eunuchs was raised to be equal to that of the regular
military and civil officials. The number of eunuchs at this time is not known, but
missionary accounts estimated their population in Ke Cho at four to five hundred
in the1680s. There is likely to have been even more of them fifty years later.
Trinh Tue was by now the leader of a group of officials who were willing to
cooperate with the eunuchs. Meanwhile, Hoang Cong Phu was occupying him-
self with building a palace in his home village a short distance northeast of the
capital.
The most urgent military problem seemed to have been the spread of disorder
coming out of the northern border provinces, so military units were ordered to
set up defensive positions to protect the lowlands from rebels coming from these
provinces. Efforts to pacify the border provinces included allying with Nung
chieftains, forgiving unpaid taxes, reducing taxes on merchants doing business in
these provinces, and forbidding the forced sale of lumber on credit, which seemed
to be a particular grievance in the border areas.
Trinh Giang insisted on calling up the soldiers from the Red River plain who
had been previously demobilized, despite strenuous objections from many of his
officials who predicted that this would simply add to the uproar. The result was

as the objecting officials feared. Rebellion gained momentum daily. Trinh Giang
organized militia units in villages still under his command, but the distribution of
weapons to men in these units became a means of supply for the rebels. He
proclaimed a tax amnesty, but it was too late to have any calming effect. He
called for more soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. He began to suffer from
panic attacks and could no longer endure noise, reportedly after being struck by
a thunderbolt. He retreated to an underground chamber and refused to emerge;
government affairs were left in the hands of Hoang Cong Phu and Trinh Tue.
In 1736, Trinh Giang had made his younger full brother, Trinh Doanh, the
commander of all military forces. As the Trinh situation deteriorated in1739,
men who were concerned and dismayed began to look to him for leadership.
They gathered around his mother and the leaders of her family, who encouraged
him to act. His reluctance to openly oppose his brother was finally overcome
when one of those urging him forward, an official from a western suburb of
Hanoi named Nguyen Cong Thai, who had recruited a large militia force from
that place, prevailed upon the king to call upon Trinh Doanh to step forward.
On the day designated for“opening the government” to begin official business
following the lunar new year in1740, Trinh Doanh with soldiers loyal to him
and Nguyen Cong Thai with his militia moved against the eunuchs, who had
their own military force. There was a battle in the capital. Trinh Doanh pre-
vailed, and there was a slaughter of eunuchs as Hoang Cong Phu, Trinh Tue, and
other prominent men in their group fled. Trinh Giang lived until1761, under
what conditions is not known.
Trinh Doanh and the age of rebellion
Trinh Doanh was only21 years old when he assumed power. He demonstrated a
competence and a decisiveness that enabled the Trinh family to survive as lords
of the palace for another generation. But most of his27 years of rule were
devoted first to surviving more than a decade of widespread rebellions and then
to sorting out the chaos produced by those rebellions. His entourage included
people who had been pushed aside by Trinh Giang for their criticisms of Trinh
government, such as Bui Si Tiem, whose ten-point analysis of problems in1731
had earned him dismissal. When Trinh Doanh took over at the beginning of
1740, he issued a fifteen-point blueprint for action that reflected the views of
such people.
First and foremost was a determination to suppress the ranks of eunuchs. This
did not mean that eunuchs were to be utterly eradicated, but rather that their
status would be reduced to what it had been before1739, as personal servants of
355 / The south and the north diverge

the ruler and not a third group at court equal to men who had earned their
positions through literary examinations and military leadership. In fact, Trinh
Doanh benefited from the abilities of several eunuchs who were effective admin-
istrators and successful generals.
Next were provisions to sort out and dismiss corrupt and incompetent officials.
A favorite form of official abuse was false accusations leading to corrupt litigation
and the confiscation of property. This was specifically forbidden. Trinh Doanh’s
followers were keen to refurbish the image of officialdom from the shabby practices
that had become endemic during previous decades. This intent, of course, would not
escape the feuds, personal animosities, and intrigues that had characterized govern-
ment in the past, but, amidst the emergency conditions of the1740s, a certain level
of competence was enforced by circumstances. Nevertheless, within weeks ofissu-
ing these good intentions, Trinh Doanh was dispensing honors, tax exemptions, and
appointments in officialdom to those contributing money and rice to fight the rebels.
The generals were also to undergo an evaluation of their abilities to determine
whether they deserved rewards or punishments. By the end of the year, a new
group of generals appeared who had risen rapidly through the ranks from the
level of common soldiers as a result of their ability. Hastening this phenomenon
were multiple defeats in battle in which many Trinh generals were captured or
lost their lives. As for the common soldiers, they were promised more fields to
support their families. Merchants were placated by abolishing customs stations
at ferry crossings and by forbidding price fixing and the forcible sale of merchan-
dise. Peasants were given an amnesty on all land and head taxes. The land tax in
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An was entirely discontinued. Furthermore, all of Trinh
Giang’s and Hoang Cong Phu’s construction projects were halted. Instead,
workers were sent to repair dikes. Finally, tax revenues were to go through the
Ministry of Finance instead of through the Six Sessions. It appears that tax
revenues being directed through the Six Sessions had a way of disappearing.
In this year, major rebellions expanded from the northern border provinces
and consumed every part of the Red River plain. The capital was an island of
Trinh authority with a tenuous lifeline to Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. Recruitment
of soldiers in these southern provinces was increased from one-fifth of the men
available for conscription to one-third. Trinh Doanh also made an appeal for
volunteers from the families of loyal officials. There was such a rush of disorderly
recruits into the capital that undisciplined soldiers began acting as gangs of
bandits. Trinh Doanh moved quickly to establish disipline over this mob,
rejecting many undesirables and putting the rest into a regimen of training and
drill. He also mobilized militia forces from localities near the capital. Bells and
gongs from temples were seized and melted down to make weapons, and people
contributing bronze and lead were given official appointments. With copper

coins being melted down for weaponry, soldiers were paid in silver, causing the
value of silver to drop, resulting in efforts to fix the value of silver.
The greatest center of rebellion was in the old Mac territory of Hai Duong in the
eastern part of the plain. The most prominent rebel leader at this time was a man
named Nguyen Tuyen. Many battles were fought along the lower Red River as
Trinh Doanh tried to prevent rebel forces from moving into this region, which was
critical for water communication between Thanh Hoa and the capital. At one
point, as he was occupied with rebel forces downriver, rebel armies from Hai
Duong moved in behind him and threatened the capital. Desperate action from
Trinh generals in the capital forced the rebel armies to move back.
Probably because Trinh Giang had made him king, Le Duy Thin was forced to
abdicate, becoming “senior king” until his death in 1759. A nephew of his,
24-year-old Le Duy Dieu, was made king. He was the eldest son of Le Duy
Tuong, the king who had died in1735. Le Duy Dieu was king for a record forty-
six years, and the short reign of his grandson, Le Duy Khiem, would mark the
end of the Le dynasty in the1780s.
In 1741, Le Duy Mat was pressing upon the capital from the northwest while
Nguyen Tuyen advanced from the southeast. When Nguyen Tuyen died, other rebel
leaders quickly took his place. Because of the fighting, there were no harvests in the
Red River plain and famine spread through the land. So many soldiers were
deserting to return to their villages that Trinh Doanh announced preferential
treatment for villages if none of their soldiers deserted. Rice was transported from
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, and more soldiers were recruited from those provinces.
The soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, realizing their importance to the
regime, demanded the right to collect taxes from villages in the Red River plain.
When this was denied, they rioted and demolished the estate of one of Trinh
Doanh’s high officials. Trinh Doanh seized and punished the ringleaders of this
affair, but the soldiers continued to be volatile and prone to disorder. At that time,
an official survey concluded that1,730 villages in the Red River plain had been
abandoned and 1,961 had been partially abandoned. Trinh Doanh took these
abandoned lands to settle soldiers in a system of military colonies (don dien). At
the same time, he changed the means of providing salaries for officials from
calculating the tax on a certain number of taxpayers to calculating the tax obtained
from a certain amount of land. This encouraged officials to get land back into
production.
Famine continued through1742 and spread into Thanh Hoa. The only infor-
mation recorded in this year was focused on Thanh Hoa, where Trinh Doanh
battled with Le Duy Mat and finally forced him into the uplands of Lang Chanh
district. Trinh Doanh raised land taxes and increased the conscription of soldiers
in Thanh Hoa during this year.

The year1743 saw fighting nearly everywhere, including the border province
of Lang Son, and especially in the eastern plains where a new rebel leader
named Nguyen Huu Cau had risen to prominence. Trinh Doanh managed to
besiege him at Do Son on the coast by the end of the year. The year1744 began
ominously when a strange huge fish, described as one hundred meters long and
with a head like an elephant, was observed swimming up the Red River to the
limit of saltwater, about thirty kilometers south of the capital, then turning and
going back out to sea. Shortly after, Nguyen Huu Cau broke the siege of Do
Son and advanced upriver to the northeastern part of the plain. Meanwhile,
another rebel leader, Nguyen Danh Phuong, had gained control of the territor-
ies north and northwest of the capital, and a third major rebel leader, Hoang
Cong Chat, was holding fast in the region downriver from the capital. The
following year did not see much change except that Nguyen Huu Cau was
driven further east into Yen Quang Province, Mac partisans attacking south out
of Cao Bang were repulsed, and Hoang Cong Chat managed to capture and kill
a Trinh governor.
During the next five years, to1750, the battlefield situation gradually changed
but without a clear indication of any side gaining an advantage. Nguyen Huu Cau
built up his position in the eastern plains. He developed a navy and obtained rice
from abroad to distribute to the starving people of that region. He spread his
authority throughout the districts east of the capital, reportedly winning popular-
ity by shielding villagers from rapacious Trinh officials. Nguyen Danh Phuong
retained control of the region northwest of the capital. Hoang Cong Chat shifted
his base of operations from the south to the northeastern part of the plain.
Meanwhile, in1749, Le Duy Mat emerged from the Thanh Hoa uplands to attack
into the region south of the capital.
The most significant piece of information about Trinh Doanh from these years
is that he began to take a strong interest in the problems of government. Perhaps
he decided that the best way to counter the appeal of rebel leaders was to provide
a plausible alternative. He published measures to improve the courts of law, to
end the abuses of corvée service, to allow militiamen time off to work in their
fields, to forgive unpaid taxes in the capital region, to reinstitute the salt tax, to
stabilize the agrarian situation in Thanh Hoa that was under stress from con-
scripting so many soldiers, and to postpone taxes on private property in Thanh
Hoa and Nghe An. In1750, he published a twelve-point manifesto that shows a
modicum of normal government to have been restored in areas under his control.
The manifesto covers the familiar ground of behavior expected of all classes of
people: great lords, high ministers, military commanders, censors, nobles, judi-
cial commissioners, magistrates, soldiers, and common people. This manifesto is
in itself not remarkable, but the fact that it was issued at this time shows that

Trinh Doanh had moved out of the phase of emergency management and was
now thinking of how to establish a regular system of administration.
The examination system received close attention from Trinh Doanh and his
advisors during the early years of his rule. The class of men aspiring to gain status
through participation in this system was not only large but also influential in
forming public opinion. The few men who gained entry to the palace examin-
ation were but a tiny minority of all those who received some social capital from
their participation in the exams that preceded it, from the district pre-exam
through the provincial regional exam and on to the capital exam. There was
intense pressure on this system of examinations, not only from aspiring students,
but also from the officials in charge of administering them, who endeavored to
ensure the success of students from families with whom they were allied or of
their own protégés.
In 1741, the “rather good” category of achievement for pre-exams and
regional exams was abolished. But without this convenient track into the
regional exams, corruption became even more open and rampant as powerful
families used their money and influence to affect the outcome of exams. In1743,
the regional exams in Nghe An were so chaotic that a riot erupted in the middle
of the exam and students destroyed the examination place. In1747, Trinh
Doanh ordered an investigation of abuses in the regional exams and subse-
quently reinstated the“rather good” stream. He also reduced district quotas
for entry to the regional exams, thereby giving more power to provincial educa-
tional officers. At the same time, a way was opened for wealthy but poorly
educated students to buy admission to part of the regional exam and thereby gain
a certain status. Aside from the mainstream of literary examinations, there were
more specialized academic evaluations. For example, in1762, clerks and
accountants were recruited into government service with examinations in writing
and mathematics, resulting in978 men selected for writing and120 selected for
math.
In 1750, the need for revenue led to a new scheme in which students of at least
10 years old could buy tickets to skip the pre-exam and to enroll in the regional
exam, which in itself conferred a coveted social status. Furthermore, they were
allowed to have substitutes take the exam for them. If the student showed
sufficient academic ability by the time of the next exam, he could compete with
the possibility of being promoted to the capital exam. This practice was motiv-
ated by a need to raise money and a desire to bring wealthy families into
officialdom. But the result was to make marketplaces out of the regional exam-
inations. In1751 there was such disorder and scandal in the regional exams that
Trinh Doanh stepped in and annulled the results of over two hundred successful
candidates who were not even students. Virtually all of the education officials in

charge of the exams that year were demoted or dismissed, but corruption of the
examination system continued unabated. In1765, according to a new rule,
admission tickets to the regional examinations were openly sold without any
conditions.
Another cycle of Trinh misgovernment
In early1751, the battlefield situation changed dramatically. Both Nguyen Huu
Cau and Nguyen Danh Phuong were captured and killed after heavy fighting.
Hoang Cong Chat was driven into the mountains of Hung Hoa. Le Duy Mat was
pushed into the mountains of Nghe An and eventually forced up the Ca River to
the Xieng Khouang plateau of Laos where he and his followers established a
small domain. Both Hoang Cong Chat and Le Duy Mat would survive in their
mountain fortresses for nearly two more decades, but they were never again
active in the lowlands. The years of rebellion were coming to an end.
By mid1751, Nhu Dinh Toan (1703–1774), a graduate of the1736 examin-
ation, from an area east of the capital, was assigned to draw up plans for
rebuilding a system of administration. He announced nine basic principles that
predictably echoed the ideals of the Hong Duc and Canh Tri eras. In more
specific terms, he proposed that the Six Sessions, the Six Ministries, the Six
Departments, the Six Courts, the Censorate, as well as the provincial and district
officials, should all bear their respective responsibilities. He observed that, in
actual fact, the Six Sessions, under direct Trinh control, decided everything while
the other offices, in the royal domain, did nothing, and many high officials and
prominent nobles did as they pleased. Two new offices were to be established to
collect taxes in the Red River plain. For good measure, the1663 “Edict to
Explain Civilizing Instructions” was reissued.
In 1752, remaining rebel bands in the lowlands were tracked down and
pacified, and officials were sent to return scattered refugees to their villages
and fields. In1753, soldiers from the Red River plain were released to bring
abandoned fields back under cultivation. In these years, Trinh Doanh held daily
meetings with his highest officials to discuss the details of restoring calm to the
country. He is reported to have admonished his Censorate and provincial judicial
officers:“All I get from you is trivia! I know there are many bad things going on.
You must report them to me so that something can be done about them.”
Two authors writing in the1740s, during the rebellions, have been remem-
bered for new literary departures. Dang Tran Con (1710–1745) wrote a long
poem entitledChinh Phu Ngam Khuc(Song of a Soldier’s Wife), a lament in the
voice of a woman whose husband had gone off to war, leaving her to mourn the

passing of her years in loneliness. This work was written in Literary Chinese.
Several later writers wrote translations of it in vernacular Nom. The most
popular vernacular version today is attributed to Phan Huy Ich (1750–1822),
written in the early nineteenth century.
The second author was Doan Thi Diem (1705–1748), the daughter of a
teacher. She wrote poetry and prose in Literary Chinese. Her work expressed
the perspective of an educated woman who considered herself to be, and was, the
intellectual equal of men. Among her works isTruyen Ky Tan Pha (New
Collection of Marvelous Stories), which includes her version of the earthly life
of the woman who became the popular goddess Lieu Hanh, emphasizing Lieu
Hanh’s erudition as a mark of her divinity. Both Dang Tran Con and Doan Thi
Diem gave impetus to the literary trend of using the voice of a woman to
comment on social and political affairs. The literary conceit of intelligent and
complaining women appeared amidst turmoil that tended to discredit the
existing political leadership of men.
By 1754, conditions were thought to have become sufficiently normal that the
king was allowed to take a day excursion by boat on the Red River. In that year,
taxation was reinstituted in the northern border provinces and officials reported
that the village populations in the lowlands had been stabilized and fields had
been restored to cultivation. Thereafter, the rural situation returned to the
familiar cycle of subsistence: a good harvest, then famine and misery, and then
waiting for the next good harvest. A drought in1755 put taxes into arrears,
clogged the courts of law with litigation over land, which was the only asset in
poverty-stricken villages, and caused soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An to
desert their units and return home to care for their families. Initiatives to reform
judicial procedures were made in1758 and again in1762, but courts of law were
as chronic a source of dismay as were the vicissitudes of agriculture. In1757
there were floods, epidemics, and a famine. In1759, there was drought, insects,
and famine. In1761 there was drought. In1762 there was a rural epidemic. In
1765 there was drought and an epidemic. In1766 there were broken dikes and
floods.
Trinh agrarian policy remained at the level of ad hoc reactions to these events.
In 1755, all unpaid taxes in the Red River plain were forgiven, and the Nghe An
land tax rate was reduced. In1756, the Six Sessions were found to be incompe-
tent at collecting the land tax so this task was put into the hands of a eunuch. In
1757, military colonies (don dien) were abolished and their land was returned to
village leaders. In1762, Thanh Hoa and Nghe An were subject to a new census
for conscripting soldiers. In1765, an edict admonished powerful families to stop
harassing the farmers. In1766, soldiers were sent to suppress an outbreak of
rural banditry in the region northwest of the capital.

Commercial policy in these years was aimed at limiting excessive exactions at
customs stations that hindered the movement of goods and discouraged mer-
chants. Copper coins were again being cast. Communities of Qing merchants
existed at Mong Cai on the coast at the Qing border, at the old port of Van Don,
and in Nghe An at Quynh Luu and at Vinh. In1764, the Qing people in these
communities were forbidden to mix with the local population and required to
stay in their own quarters.
Christianity was routinely proscribed along with various forms of undesirable
behavior such as gambling. The number of Christians nevertheless continued to
grow. During the fifty years from the beginning of Trinh Cuong’s rule in1709
through Trinh Doanh’s rule in the1760s, eighty-six European missionaries are
recorded as having served among the northern Vietnamese and111 northern
Vietnamese were ordained as priests. Major concentrations of Christian commu-
nities developed in Nghe An, in the coastal area south of Ke Cho at modern Phat
Diem, and in the region east of Ke Cho at Ke Sat and neighboring areas of the
Hai Duong plain. The missionaries tried to keep Christians out of the rebellions
of the1730s and 1740s but were not always successful in doing so. Their
accounts describe the grinding misery of rural life. Christian soldiers served in
the military during those years, being allowed to swear an oath of loyalty to the
Trinh in the name of the Christian god rather than of the traditional mountain
spirit.
In the mid1750s, Trinh Doanh’s interest in the examination system extended
to conducting continuing evaluations of the officials who had emerged from that
system and who, in peacetime, were taking greater roles in government adminis-
tration. In1756, he assigned Le Quy Don (1726–1784), a graduate of1752 from
the coastal region of modern Thai Binh Province, to examine all officials and
make recommendations for promotions and demotions. Le Quy Don was a
relatively erudite man, which may explain the confidence placed in him by Trinh
Doanh. He was also a clever self-promoter and did not neglect opportunities to
advance the careers of men in his debt or to derail the careers of men he did not
like. In1762, Trinh Doanh established a privy council (bi thu cac) and put Le
Quy Don in charge of it along with an older official named Nguyen Ba Lan
(1701–1786), a graduate of1731. Shortly after, Le Quy Don departed as envoy
to China. When he returned in1765, however, he made himself so ridiculous by
ostensibly announcing his errors while in fact publicly praising himself that Trinh
Doanh dismissed him into early retirement.
In 1767, Trinh Doanh died and was succeeded by his eldest son Trinh Sam.
Trinh Sam had been designated as heir fourteen years earlier when he was a
teenager. At the time of his elevation, Ngo Thi Si (1725–1780), an official who
had been brought into officialdom in1756 when Le Quy Don was ascendant,

was in the northern mountains with a group of subordinates. He had been sent
by Trinh Doanh to bring the mining operations there under control. All the
profits from the mines were going to Qing businessmen across the border and Ke
Cho administrators were stymied in their efforts to collect taxes. It is typical of
Trinh Sam’s rule that, upon his coming to power, Ngo Thi Si and his colleagues
were recalled to the capital and no further effort was taken to deal with the
perennial problem of the mines along the Qing border. Trinh Sam called Le Quy
Don back from retirement, and, during the next fifteen years, Le Quy Don and
Ngo Thi Si were prominent in a group of officials who worked closely with
eunuchs to maintain a modicum of public order while attending to Trinh Sam’s
wishes and their own enrichment.
Trinh Sam bore lifelong resentment against the Le family, being incurably
jealous of its royal status. He had grown up with the crown prince, Le Duy Vi,
and the two young men nurtured a deep hatred of one another. Le Duy Vi
resented Trinh domination of the royal family, and Trinh Sam was consumed
with an impossible desire for the throne. The personal animus between the two
came to a head in1769 when Trinh Sam deposed and imprisoned Le Duy Vi,
replacing him as crown prince with a younger brother, Le Duy Can. This
happened shortly after the death of the old rebel Hoang Cong Chat in the
mountains of Hung Hoa and an expedition that decisively defeated his son, thus
putting to an end that group of diehards from the rebellions of two decades
before. The only remaining holdout from that era was Le Duy Mat, the prince
who had established himself on the Xieng Khouang plateau of Laos.
One of the main things that occupied Trinh Sam’s attention after he came to
power was his determination to put an end to Le Duy Mat. In fact, when Trinh
Doanh died in1767, Le Duy Mat decided to test the new Trinh ruler by leading
his men out of the mountains to attack him. Trinh armies drove him back into
the mountains and from then on were urged forward by Trinh Sam with orders
to destroy this prince who for thirty years had flourished the banner of Le
resistance to the Trinh. In1770, Le Duy Mat’s stronghold finally fell and he
took his own life.
In 1771, Trinh Sam killed Le Duy Vi and imprisoned Le Duy Vi’s three sons.
The eldest of these sons, Le Duy Khiem, a future king, was then6 years old.
Trinh Sam continued to look for new ways to humiliate the royal family, and he
found a willing henchman for this endeavor in Le Quy Don. Le Quy Don had
been rising in Trinh Sam’s esteem as a result of his passing along a percentage of
the wealth that he was accumulating through bribery and corruption. In1771,
Le Quy Don was in the Censorate and was cultivating eunuchs close to Trinh
Sam by giving them positions of supervision over officials. He managed to
insinuate himself into the confidence of Pham Huy Dinh, a eunuch who was a

great favorite of Trinh Sam. Together they embarked on various corrupt
schemes. Le Quy Don began to use the position of immunity conferred by his
alliance with the eunuchs to penalize officials who were close to the king. Within
a short time he was able to sufficiently intimidate officials to stop them from
attending the bi-monthly sessions of the royal court on the first and fifteenth days
of the lunar month. This gave immense satisfaction to Trinh Sam, whose passion
for demeaning the royal court was insatiable.
By the early1770s, when events in the south began to open new possibilities,
Trinh government at Ke Cho had survived an age of insurrection without having
seriously addressed its causes. The inability of rebel leaders to unite and Trinh
Doanh’s persistence gave the Trinh regime an opportunity to be renewed. How-
ever, instead of renewal, once the rebellions had been calmed, the Trinh simply
returned to the conundrums that had been at the heart of their political problems
from the very beginning: a dependence upon soldiers from the southern prov-
inces to rule a sullen and impoverished population in the Red River plain and an
inability to escape from doubts about the Trinh right to exercise power on behalf
of the Le dynasty. Trinh Tac had addressed the first of these problems by
bringing the literati of the Red River plain into his government. But the long-
term effect of this was simply to burden the agriculturalists of the Red River plain
with a new class of predators. The northern Vietnamese had not been able to find
a way out of this impasse. The impetus for a new age would come from the
southerners. The relative passivity of the northerners during the Thirty Years
War that broke out in the1770s revealed an exhaustion of hope that came from
generations of oppression, poverty, and despair.

8 THE THIRTY YEARS WAR
The rise of Qui Nhon
In the1770s, war broke out among the Vietnamese. The immediate cause was an
uprising in Binh Dinh Province against the misgovernment of Truong Phuc Loan.
People in Binh Dinh had for generations borne the brunt of demands for soldiers,
supplies, and transport to sustain Nguyen Phuc policy in the Mekong plain as
well as in the mountainous hinterlands. When an ascendant Siam began to
challenge the Vietnamese position in Cambodia and the court at Phu Xuan could
not rise above a morass of corruption and incompetence, a new political force
emerged in Binh Dinh.
In 1767, Burmese invaders seized Ayutthia, the capital of Siam. A provincial
Siamese governor named Taksin subsequently expelled the invaders and reigned
as king for fourteen years (1768–1782). Taksin’s father, a Teochow Chinese, had
made a career as a Siamese tax collector while also being active in the Chinese
merchant community of Siam. Taksin had spent part of his youth doing business
in Cambodia and reportedly learned to speak both Khmer and Vietnamese. He
launched his bid to become king of Siam from Chanthaburi, on the southeastern
coast of Siam near the Cambodian border. His familiarity with Cambodia may
explain his desire to reduce this Siamese neighbor to vassalage. His means of
accomplishing this was to champion the cause of a Khmer prince who came to be
known as Chei Chéttha V, the son of Chei Chéttha IV, a former king who had
died in1757.
The king of Cambodia in the1760s was Outeireachea III. The Vietnamese had
placed him on the Khmer throne in1758 through the intervention of Mac Thien
Tu, the lord of Ha Tien. Consequently, Outeireachea III was closely allied with
Mac Thien Tu and the Vietnamese. As early as1768, Taksin sent military forces
by sea and seized some territory on the Cambodian coast around Kampot, only
about forty kilometers northwest of Ha Tien, but Outeireachea III refused his
demand to pay tribute. In1769, Siamese and Khmer forces supporting Chei

Chéttha V attacked Outeireachea III and, at the same time, a Teochow Chinese
serving as Taksin’s agent conspired with some members of Mac Thien Tu’s
family against him. Both the attack and the conspiracy failed.
Mac Thien Tu held a strong position on the Khmer–Viet coast, which, rather
than the overland route, was Taksin’s chosen approach to the Khmer capital.
Taksin decided that in order to prevail against Outeireachea III, he would first
have to deal with Mac Thien Tu. In1770, several hundred Khmers and Malays
who were allied with Taksin, led by a turncoat from Mac Thien Tu’s army,
assaulted Ha Tien by sea. Mac Thien Tu defeated this challenge but it provoked
great disorder in his domain. Some Ha Tien Chinese were interested in doing
business with the half-Teochow Siamese king and were ready to throw off their
allegiance to Phu Xuan. In this same year, people in the Central Highlands,
emboldened by Phu Xuan’s inattention or by Taksin’s agents or by both,
emerged from the mountains to plunder Quang Ngai, spreading fear and confu-
sion along the coast from Quang Nam to Phu Yen.
In 1771, Taksin arrived by sea with a large army. He seized Ha Tien and
marched to the Khmer capital at Oudong, where he enthroned Chei Chéttha V.
Mac Thien Tu and Outeireachea III fled to Saigon. At the same time as Taksin
was putting his candidate on the Cambodian throne, whether by coincidence or
by design, a man named Nguyen Nhac, supported by uplanders, Chams, Chinese
merchants, and Vietnamese peasants established himself at An Khe on the main
east–west trade route through the Central Highlands that connected the port of
Qui Nhon with northern Cambodia and the Siamese capital. He raised a flag of
rebellion and thereby initiated the Thirty Years War.
The Mekong plain was alive with battles between Khmer armies and their
Siamese and Vietnamese allies as a large Vietnamese expeditionary force was
mobilized at Saigon in late1771 and early 1772. By mid1772, this force had
advanced up the Mekong and restored Outeireachea III to his throne. Taksin
withdrew his soldiers to the coast and returned to Siam. Thereafter, he relied
upon the disorder that began to spread among the Vietnamese to serve his
interests in Cambodia.
In early1773, Nguyen Nhac seized Qui Nhon. He claimed descent from Ho
Quy Ly. A paternal ancestor had been taken as a prisoner of war by the
southerners during the fighting in Nghe An during the1650s and was settled
on the upland frontier of Binh Dinh Province at a village named Tay Son (“west
mountain”). His surname was changed to Nguyen, the most common surname in
the south for displaced people seeking to identify with the new ruling house.
Nguyen Nhac traveled widely as an itinerant betel merchant and tax collector,
which gave him first-hand knowledge of conditions in many regions. According
to Nguyen historians, he had a weakness for gambling and had a habit of using

tax revenue to pay his gambling debts. When this was brought to light by higher
authorities, he fled to the mountains and organized a rebellion. But there was
more to his uprising than this, for he mobilized upland peoples from the Central
Highlands and he also drew upon Cham symbols of kingship to rally large
numbers of Chams. He furthermore gained the support of the Chinese merchant
community at the port of Qui Nhon. Tay Son and An Khe were connected to
Chinese merchant communities not only in Qui Nhon on the coast but also in
Cambodia and at the Siamese capital further west. Nguyen Nhac’s seizure of Qui
Nhon made him a major figure in the political world of the Vietnamese-speaking
peoples. He would rule from Qui Nhon until his death in1793.
Nguyen Nhac benefited from a popular attribution of all the country’s woes to
the perfidy of Truong Phuc Loan and his usurpation of the authority of the
legitimate Nguyen Phuc royal house. He had no trouble finding recruits for his
armies. He used unusual tactics to unnerve his enemies, simple tricks like having
his men hiss and rattle their weapons when attacking. He organized shock troops
with especially tall men who were sent into battle with Qing haircuts, naked with
gold and silver paper pasted to their bodies as offerings to the gods, and inebri-
ated to the point of being eager to die. Phu Xuan soldiers, led by incompetent
cronies of Truong Phuc Loan, fled from Nguyen Nhac’s armies. By the end of
1773, Nguyen Nhac’s men had advanced south all the way to the border of Gia
Dinh and north to the border of Quang Nam.
Nguyen Cuu Dat, a scion of the redoubtable Nguyen Cuu family that had
already served the Nguyen Phuc with distinction for a century and a half,
repulsed Nguyen Nhac’s attacks into Quang Nam. In early1774, the Phu Xuan
armies based at Gia Dinh pushed north and retook all the territories up to the
mountainous terrain at Ca Pass on the southern border of Phu Yen Province. But
within a few weeks the situation changed dramatically when Trinh Sam decided
to march south.
Despite a famine in Nghe An, Trinh Sam could not resist taking advantage of
the troubles besetting the old enemies of his family in the south. He recalled from
retirement a eunuch with a reputation for competence, Hoang Ngu Phuc
(d.1775), and put him in command of an expedition into the south. When he
crossed the Gianh River in autumn of1774, Hoang Ngu Phuc announced that he
was coming to help put down Nguyen Nhac’s rebellion. He met with Nguyen
Phuc envoys, and they assured him that this was not necessary. But one of the
envoys, wanting to unseat Truong Phuc Loan, secretly encouraged him to
continue his march south. All of the best military officers in the southern army
were in Quang Nam resisting Nguyen Nhac. Officers facing the Trinh army were
timid or incompetent. Furthermore, Thuan Hoa was in the grip of famine.
A shipment of rice sent from Ha Tien by Mac Thien Tu had been captured by

Nguyen Nhac’s men. People in Thuan Hoa were dying and there were reports of
cannibalism. When the Trinh army arrived at the Tran Ninh Wall, the southern
soldiers opened the gates and fled.
As Hoang Ngu Phuc took possession of the abandoned system of walls, he
issued another message saying that he had come not only to deliver the south-
erners from Nguyen Nhac’s rebellion but also to relieve them of the usurping
despot Truong Phuc Loan. He called upon the southerners to deliver Truong
Phuc Loan into his hands. A group of Nguyen Phuc princes and Nguyen Cuu
Phap, another member of the Nguyen Cuu family, gathered the nerve to seize
Truong Phuc Loan and deliver him to Hoang Ngu Phuc. Hoang Ngu Phuc
continued his advance south as the20-year-old ruler, Nguyen Phuc Thuan, and
a band of princes who rallied around him, desperately attempted to organize
resistance to the Trinh advance. In the last month of1774, Hoang Ngu Phuc
entered Phu Xuan and the Nguyen Phuc leaders fled to Quang Nam.
Within weeks, the forces of Nguyen Nhac were moving north to take advan-
tage of Phu Xuan’s fall. Two Chinese merchants, Tap Dinh and Ly Tai, had
joined Nguyen Nhac when he seized Qui Nhon in1773 and had raised shipborne
armies that included Qing pirates. These men led Nguyen Nhac’s naval forces to
blockade Hoi An at the mouth of the Thu Bon River as Nguyen Nhac’s land
forces marched north along the foothills then downriver to meet them. The
Nguyen Phuc were defeated and looked for ways to escape. Nguyen Phuc Thuan
named a nephew, Nguyen Phuc Duong, son of a crown prince who had died in
1760, to be crown prince and left him in command of the soldiers that remained
in Quang Nam, while he and as many as could get away embarked for Gia Dinh.
A boat carrying the Nguyen Phuc generals was lost in a storm, but a boat
carrying Nguyen Phuc Thuan and Nguyen Phuc Anh, the fourteen-year-old son
of Nguyen Phuc Con, Nguyen Phuc Khoat’s designated heir, whom Truong Phuc
Loan had killed in1765, arrived at Nha Trang and was welcomed by loyal
officials there before continuing the journey to Gia Dinh.
Nguyen Nhac captured Nguyen Phuc Duong in Quang Nam shortly before
Hoang Ngu Phuc advanced from the north and pushed him back out of the
province. Tap Dinh, defeated by the Trinh, fled to Guangdong where he was
killed by Qing authorities, who regarded him as a pirate. Ly Tai followed
Nguyen Nhac back to Qui Nhon. Nguyen Phuc Duong urged Nguyen Nhac to
unite with Nguyen Phuc Thuan at Gia Dinh against the Trinh, but Nguyen Nhac
had an idea of proclaiming Nguyen Phuc Duong as king to rally the southerners
against the Trinh. Nguyen Phuc Duong refused to cooperate with this scheme,
and for a few months in mid1775 Nguyen Nhac’s fortunes appeared to be in
decline as Trinh armies arrived at the northern border of Quang Ngai and
Nguyen Phuc armies retook Phu Yen, just south of Qui Nhon. Ly Tai, thinking

that Nguyen Nhac was not treating him with sufficient regard, defected to the
Nguyen Phuc forces in Phu Yen.
Under attack from the Nguyen Phuc armies in Phu Yen to the south and with
the Trinh army threatening to advance into Quang Ngai to the north, Nguyen
Nhac sent treasure to Hoang Ngu Phuc requesting to submit. He viewed the
Trinh, far from their line of supply and in unfamiliar territory, as a less danger-
ous foe than the Nguyen Phuc. Hoang Ngu Phuc sent one of his generals,
Nguyen Huu Chinh, to meet with Nguyen Nhac, to accept his submission, and
to appoint him to lead the vanguard against the Nguyen Phuc.
Within a few weeks, the situation dramatically changed when an epidemic
wasted the Trinh army in Quang Nam. Hoang Ngu Phuc withdrew to Phu Xuan
and died shortly after. The Trinh abandoned Quang Nam, settled down to
govern Thuan Hoa, and thereafter posed no threat of advancing further south.
Nguyen Nhac marched north and retook Quang Nam from Nguyen Phuc
partisans who had risen up when the Trinh withdrew. At the same time, Nguyen
Nhac’s younger brother Nguyen Hue attacked south into Phu Yen and put
Nguyen Phuc forces there on the defensive.
Nguyen Nhac moved quickly to take advantage of this turn of affairs. At the
beginning of 1776, he sent another younger brother, Nguyen Lu, with a large
seaborne expedition to Gia Dinh. Nguyen Lu seized Saigon. One Nguyen Phuc
official, Bui Huu Le, was captured and subsequently became famous for bitterly
scolding one of Nguyen Lu’s generals to his face, which so infuriated his captors
that they killed and ate him.
Buoyed by the victories in Quang Nam and in Gia Dinh, Nguyen Nhac, in the
spring of1776, proclaimed himself King of Tay Son at Cha Ban, the old Cham
capital of Vijaya, around twenty-five kilometers northwest of Qui Nhon, near
the modern town of An Nhon. Here, he would reign for the next seventeen years.
But only two months later, the Nguyen Phuc general at My Tho, Do Thanh
Nhan, retook Saigon, sending Nguyen Lu fleeing back to Qui Nhon. During the
next year, from mid1776 to mid1777, Nguyen Phuc politics at Saigon unraveled
when Ly Tai arrived from Phu Yen and a feud broke out between him and Do
Thanh Nhan. When Nguyen Phuc Duong arrived in Saigon after escaping from
Nguyen Nhac, Ly Tai promoted his claim to be king and forced Nguyen Phuc
Thuan to yield. At My Tho, Do Thanh Nhan (d.1781) and Nguyen Phuc Anh
remained attached to Nguyen Phuc Thuan, the“senior king.”
During the fighting with Nguyen Lu earlier in the year, Nguyen Phuc Thuan
had called upon the Cambodian king for assistance. In the previous year,1775,
Outeireachea III had made peace with Taksin’s candidate for the Khmer throne,
Chei Chéttha V. Chei Chéttha V became king and Outeireachea III went into
retirement. In1776, Chei Chéttha V refused Nguyen Phuc Thuan’s appeal. Later

in the year, Nguyen Phuc Anh led a brief raiding expedition up the Mekong to
punish him for this. Although only14 years old, he had organized his own army,
and he began to show unusual qualities of leadership.
After five years of fighting, two Vietnamese regimes had become three. The
northerners had taken Thuan Hoa but were incapable of moving any further
south. Nguyen Nhac’s regime was ascendant from Hai Van Pass in the north to
the Binh Thuan dry zone in the south. Remnants of the Nguyen Phuc family and
their followers desperately endeavored to build a new center of power at Saigon.
This was not a war between northerners and southerners. For the most part, the
northerners were passive observers in this war, handicapped by poor leadership,
dysfunctional government, and a demoralized population. This became a war
between two groups of southerners based at Qui Nhon and at Saigon. The
importance of Saigon became increasingly apparent as the years of war accumu-
lated. In the earlier phases of the war, control of Saigon was the prize of battle.
Resurgence of the Nguyen Phuc and decline of the Trinh
In the spring of1777, Nguyen Nhac sent Nguyen Hue to Saigon with a large
seaborne expedition. In a six-month campaign, Nguyen Hue defeated all the
Nguyen Phuc armies, including those of Mac Thien Tu and reinforcements from
Phu Yen. Nguyen Phuc Thuan, Nguyen Phuc Duong, and most of the Nguyen
Phuc princes were captured and killed, as was Ly Tai. Mac Thien Tu fled to
Siam. Nguyen Phuc Anh escaped through many vicissitudes to the island of Tho
Chu,150 kilometers into the sea west of the Ca Mau peninsula. For a short time
he found refuge at a Christian seminary in Ha Tien directed by a French
missionary named Pierre Pigneau (1741–1799, later known as Pigneau de
Behaine and, in Vietnamese, Ba Da Loc). Pierre Pigneau spent the rest of his life
devoted to Nguyen Phuc Anh’s cause. Shortly after Nguyen Hue had returned to
Qui Nhon in the autumn of1777, Nguyen Phuc Anh rallied men in Gia Dinh
loyal to his family. By the end of the year, with the assistance of Do Thanh Nhan
and others, he had retaken Saigon.
During the first half of1778, Nguyen Phuc Anh repulsed all Tay Son efforts to
regain Saigon. During the second half of the year, he was busy building military
bases and sea-going warships. In1779, he established an administrative structure
to govern the major population centers in the Mekong plain. In this year, he also
intervened in Cambodia to establish a regime that was friendly to him.
Outeireachea III had died in1777.I n1778, Chei Chéttha V, as a Siamese vassal,
had conscripted an army and sent it to join Taksin’s invasion of Laos. This
provoked distress, unrest, and, finally, rebellion. In1779, Nguyen Phuc Anh sent

Do Thanh Nhan with an army to place Ang Eng, a5-year-old son of Out-
eireachea III, on the throne. Chei Chéttha V was killed, and a pro-Vietnamese
nobleman named Mou was appointed to serve as regent for the young king.
In 1780, Nguyen Phuc Anh, at the age of18, proclaimed himself king at
Saigon. His authority extended north into the province of Phu Yen and west to
his vassal in Cambodia. In a domain of rivers and coasts, shipbuilding continued
to be a priority, and a new design of two-level galleys began to be produced at
Saigon, with rowers in the bottom level and soldiers on the upper level. Do
Thanh Nhan invented innovative means of attacking in swampy terrain while
pacifying Khmer resistance in Tra Vinh. Do Thanh Nhan’s successes and the
trust that Nguyen Phuc Anh placed in him made him a target of jealousy, and it
may have been that his popularity among the soldiers began to threaten Nguyen
Phuc Anh’s sense of security. Whether with reason or not, in spring of1781 Do
Thanh Nhan was accused of disloyalty and killed. A subsequent uprising led by
men loyal to him was put down with hard fighting. Shortly after, Nguyen Phuc
Anh sent a large army north to join the battles in Phu Yen. With it went some
eighty war boats, two of them of European design. This was the high point of
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s fortunes before many years of tribulation and exile.
Since proclaiming himself king in1776, Nguyen Nhac had been frustrated in
his efforts to destroy the Nguyen Phuc. He was not able to concentrate his
attention on his southern enemy because he remained uncertain about his north-
ern enemy, with whom he maintained an uneasy truce. During these years, his
base of power was in the three provinces of Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai, and Quang
Nam. His southern border in Phu Yen was in perpetual contestation, while the
border between Quang Nam and Thuan Hoa needed constant vigilance, for the
Trinh frequently sent raids into Quang Nam to test Tay Son readiness and to
collect rice. This situation began to change in1781 and 1782 as a result of events
related to the failing health and death of Trinh Sam.
In the late1770s and early1780s, there was a series of droughts and nearly
constant famine conditions in the north. Taxes were regularly excused due to
rural hunger. Meanwhile the same old agrarian problems continued to appear
with corruption drying up tax revenue and unsuccessful efforts to repopulate
abandoned fields. In1776, the taxes of over half of all registered fields were
assigned to officials in lieu of salaries. Officials wanted to change salaries from
fields to cash, but cash was unavailable. In this year, the government appears to
have given up on any effort to even think about village conditions. The require-
ment that provincial officials make an annual report on the welfare of the
common people was discontinued with the argument that it was a troublesome
procedure that wasted time and produced no results. Yet, in1779, as famine
conditions became difficult to ignore, an edict went out for officials to investigate

the living conditions of the people, but there is no indication of any result.
Northerners had learned to live with misgovernment.
Despite his inability to address real problems, Trinh Sam could not shake away
his desire to be king. In1777 he sent an envoy to Qing reporting that the Le
dynasty was extinct and requesting recognition of himself as king. The envoy was
so disturbed by his mission that after departing he burned his documents and
took poison. In these years, Ngo Thi Si and especially Le Quy Don pandered to
Trinh Sam’s whims. Le Quy Don and his disreputable son became notorious for
corruption. The son was briefly imprisoned in 1775 when he was caught
cheating in the capital examination. In1776, Le Quy Don spent several months
in Thuan Hoa, assigned to inspect and report on conditions there. In1777 he
was sent to inspect the tax registers in Thanh Hoa. In1778, Trinh Sam ignored
public denunciations of Le Quy Don and his son for corruption. In1779, Le Quy
Don suffered a brief embarrassment when his corrupt dealings with an upland
chieftain in the northern mountains provoked an uprising. The fact was that
an important source of wealth for Trinh Sam was from corrupt officials like Le
Quy Don.
In 1780, Trinh Sam demoted his eldest son Trinh Khai and instead named as
his heir Trinh Cau, a sickly infant son of his favorite concubine. Trinh Cau’s
mother was closely allied with the family of Hoang Ngu Phuc, the famous, now
deceased, general. There were rumors that Hoang Ngu Phuc’s grandson, Hoang
Dinh Bao, was her lover and that he planned to murder the child and seize power
for himself. Nguyen Khai was imprisoned when he was discovered to be in a plot
against Hoang Dinh Bao. Le Quy Don and members of his clique were busy on
behalf of Hoang Dinh Bao. For two years, this situation drifted along with both
Trinh Sam and Trinh Cau incapacitated by illness.
When Trinh Sam died in autumn of1782, the Thanh Hoa and Nghe An
soldiers stationed in Ke Cho killed Hoang Dinh Bao, discarded Trinh Cau, and
released Trinh Khai from prison, making him lord of the palace. When the élite
prisons were opened to release Trinh Khai, three grandsons of the king were also
released. They had been imprisoned in1769 along with their father, former
crown prince Le Duy Vi, Trinh Sam’s childhood nemesis. Le Duy Vi had been
replaced as crown prince by a younger brother, and then killed two years later. In
early1783, the soldiers raised the eldest of Le Duy Vi’s sons,18-year-old Le Duy
Khiem, to be the crown prince, deposing a younger brother of Le Duy Vi who
had been selected by Trinh Sam.
One member of the Hoang Dinh Bao faction was Nguyen Huu Chinh, a
protégé of Hoang Ngu Phuc who was then in command of Nghe An Province.
With his enemies gaining power at Ke Cho, he was in a vulnerable position, so he
decided to flee south and join Nguyen Nhac. He had been Hoang Ngu Phuc’s

envoy to Nguyen Nhac in1775 and the two men reportedly had gotten along
well on that occasion. He now advised Nguyen Nhac that it would be a propi-
tious time to take Thuan Hoa.
Meanwhile, at Ke Cho, the Thanh Hoa and Nghe An soldiers, having tasted
power, began to dominate and terrorize public life with riots and homicides. In
1784, Trinh Khai made a secret plan to raise soldiers from the Red River plain to
pacify the Thanh Hoa and Nghe An men, but he was stymied when word of it
leaked out. Efforts to placate the soldiers failed. They established a regime of
pillaging that began to replace any semblance of normal government. In1785,
Bui Huy Bich (1744–1802), a graduate of 1769 from the capital, tried to
encourage greater soberness among the arrogant soldiers by giving more visibil-
ity to the king, Le Duy Dieu. He did this by making large events of the public
sessions of the royal court on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month,
which Le Quy Don, on behalf of Trinh Sam, had sabotaged more than a decade
earlier. But the theater of ritual was no substitute for military discipline.
The Trinh reliance upon the soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, which for
generations had been the source of Trinh strength, had now become the source of
Trinh weakness. Leadership at Ke Cho was at an impasse, and a foe was now
gathering new strength in the south.
Tay Son ascendancy and division
King Taksin of Siam was not reconciled to the ascendant position gained by the
Vietnamese in Cambodia when Ang Eng was placed on the throne with Mou as
regent in1779.I n 1780, he took an accusation of conspiracy as reason to kill
fifty-three high-ranking Vietnamese refugees in Siam, including Mac Thien Tu
and a son of Nguyen Phuc Khoat. During the winter dry season of1781–1782,
he sent General Chakri to attack the Vietnamese and their Khmer allies in
Cambodia. In the midst of this campaign, Taksin was deposed in a coup. Chakri
met with the Vietnamese generals and negotiated an end to hostilities, then
hastened back to Siam where he was crowned king. This was the beginning of
an alliance between Chakri and Nguyen Phuc Anh that would continue for
twenty years, until the end of the Vietnamese wars.
Shortly after the return of the Vietnamese army from Cambodia in spring of
1782, Nguyen Nhac and Nguyen Hue arrived with several hundred ships and
thousands of men at the Can Gio estuary, the main entrance to the Sai Gon and
Dong Nai Rivers. As the Tay Son forces fought their way upriver their progress
was reportedly resisted the longest by a European-style ship commanded by a
Frenchman whose name was recorded by the Vietnamese as Man Hoe

(Manuel). This man was a French adventurer who had been introduced to
Nguyen Phuc Anh by Pierre Pigneau. He perished with his ship, and the Tay
Son took Saigon. As Tay Son armies moved against Nguyen Phuc Anh at My
Tho, Nguyen Phuc armies from the northern coast arrived and attacked the Tay
Son from the other direction. During the battle that ensued, troops under the
command of generals from the Chinese community in Cholon managed to kill a
kinsman of Nguyen Nhac, which so enraged him that he slaughtered some ten
thousand members of the Chinese community– men, women, and children–
filling the rivers with their corpses. Nguyen Phuc Anh was soon forced to flee to
Phu Quoc Island, off the coast of Ha Tien, where he sent a request to Chakri of
Siam for help.
Nguyen Nhac and Nguyen Hue returned to Qui Nhon at mid summer. In the
autumn, Nguyen Phuc Anh fought his way back to retake Saigon. For six months
he feverishly prepared for the expected Tay Son counterattack while also mobil-
izing a Khmer army from Cambodia. Nguyen Hue and Nguyen Lu returned to
the offensive in spring1783, arriving at Gia Dinh with a large seaborne army.
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s allied Khmer–Viet armies were defeated, and he eventually
found refuge again on Phu Quoc Island.
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s appeal to Chakri was answered in autumn1783 with
Siamese armies moving through Cambodia to attack the Tay Son. The pro-
Vietnamese regent, Mou, was killed by his enemies and replaced by a pro-
Siamese regent, Ben, who ceded Cambodia’s western provinces to Siam and sent
the young king, Ang Eng, to Bangkok for safekeeping. A younger brother of
Mou named Ten mobilized his followers and joined the Tay Son resistance
against the advance of the Siamese. A second Siamese force arrived by sea at
Ha Tien. Tay Son and Siamese armies confronted each other and fought several
battles in the region of Sa Dec until the Siamese were forced to withdraw in late
1783. The Tay Son advanced to Phnom Penh where they placed Ten in power.
The pro-Vietnamese Khmer had found new patrons in the Tay Son. Meanwhile,
Siamese forces remained in Cambodia to support Ben at Oudong. Nguyen Phuc
Anh and what survived of his entourage found refuge at Chakri’s court in the
new Siamese capital of Bangkok.
In mid1784 a large Siamese expedition set out against the Tay Son both by
land and by sea. The Siamese defeated the Tay Son at Sa Dec and continued
downriver toward My Tho, the gateway to Saigon. Nguyen Phuc Anh com-
plained to the Siamese generals that their men were plundering the local people
and giving him a bad name. The Siamese generals seem not to have paid him any
heed, nor to have availed themselves of his local knowledge. Ignorant of tidal
currents in the lower Mekong, they fell into a Tay Son ambush as they prepared
to attack My Tho by river. In the last lunar month of the year, at what became

known as the Battle of Rach Gam–Xoai Mut, Nguyen Hue defeated the Siamese
expedition and sent it fleeing back the way it had come.
Nguyen Phuc Anh was once again reduced to being an offshore wanderer. By
late spring 1785 he had found refuge in Siam. He built a settlement outside of
Bangkok and rallied his scattered followers. Within a few months several
thousand men had gathered under his command. For the next year he served
as a loyal ally of Chakri while sending spies to stay informed of conditions in
Gia Dinh. He led his army against Burmese invaders, reportedly making use of
“fire-spewing pipes.” When Malay invaders threatened the Siamese south, he
sent men to help repulse them. After two years of exile in Siam, a falling out
among the Tay Son leaders gave him the opportunity he needed to return to Gia
Dinh.
During 1785, the north was plagued with continual rain, insect infestations,
pirates ravaging the coast of Yen Quang (modern Quang Ninh), soaring rice
prices, famine, and starvation. At Ke Cho, Trinh Khai watched helplessly as the
soldiers from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An strutted around the capital and intimi-
dated government officials. In Thuan Hoa, the Trinh governor was uninterested
in military matters. He spent his time building a personal fortune from commer-
cial ventures while letting border defense lapse.
After Tay Son forces had gained control of Gia Dinh and expelled Nguyen
Phuc Anh into Siamese exile, and after news from the north indicated that the
Trinh were in trouble, Nguyen Nhac decided to act on Nguyen Huu Chinh’s
advice to seize Thuan Hoa and thereby reassemble the old Nguyen Phuc domain
under his hand. In summer of1786, Nguyen Nhac sent Nguyen Hue into Thuan
Hoa. Nguyen Huu Chinh and Vo Van Nham commanded land forces and
Nguyen Lu commanded naval forces. Treachery among the Trinh generals
assisted their advance, and Thuan Hoa was taken with relative ease.
Nguyen Hue then made a decision that would have far-reaching consequences.
Nguyen Huu Chinh and other northerners were urging him to march on Ke Cho,
pointing out that government in the north was in disarray. Without consulting
his elder brother, Nguyen Hue left Nguyen Lu at Phu Xuan and continued north,
announcing that he intended“to exterminate the Trinh and restore the Le.”
Meeting little resistance along the way, he arrived at Ke Cho in less than a
month. Trinh Khai fled and took his own life as the southerners suppressed the
disorderly soldiers in the capital.
Nguyen Hue went to see the king. Le Duy Dieu was known as a kindhearted
and even-tempered man. He was now70 years old and in poor health. He
endeavored to placate Nguyen Hue by giving him one of his daughters in
marriage. And then he suddenly died. Le Duy Khiem, the21-year-old crown
prince, was raised to the throne. Shortly after, as Le Duy Dieu was being buried

in Thanh Hoa, Nguyen Nhac appeared, angry about his younger brother’s
insubordinate northern adventure.
Nguyen Nhac considered involvement in northern affairs to be a great mistake
and saw no value in the north except as a place to plunder, and plundering is
what he and his men proceeded to do. But most of all, Nguyen Nhac did not like
Nguyen Hue acting on his own initiative. For his part, Nguyen Hue was begin-
ning to see beyond his brother’s provincial perspective and to chafe at his
brother’s efforts to keep him in line. He also understood that the north was a
difficult place to govern and that he needed a base in the south.
The two brothers quarreled, then raced back south to mobilize their follow-
ers and test their clashing ambitions on the battlefield. Nguyen Nhac called on
his army in Gia Dinh to march north to assist him. Nguyen Hue ambushed it
in Phu Yen and forced it to surrender. The two brothers fought for several
months in their home province of Binh Dinh. Nguyen Hue besieged Nguyen
Nhac in his capital of Cha Ban, but the brothers had exhausted each other,
and, in early 1787, negotiated a peace, partitioning the Tay Son realm.
Nguyen Hue received Thuan Hoa and northern Quang Nam. He went to
Phu Xuan and proclaimed himself“the king that pacifies the north.” Nguyen
Nhac proclaimed himself “emperor of the center ” at Cha Ban and sent
Nguyen Lu to hold Gia Dinh.
The fighting among the Tay Son brothers gave Nguyen Phuc Anh the oppor-
tunity he had been waiting for. By early1787, his agents were already active
along the coasts of Ha Tien, Rach Gia, and Ca Mau. In early autumn, he and his
men slipped away from Siam by sea. He established himself on the island of Hon
Tre off the Rach Gia coast. The Tay Son governor of the lands along the western
Vietnamese coast submitted to him, as did a Qing pirate on Con Dao Island.
Within weeks he had gained the submission of all the territory south of the lower
branch of the Mekong.
A premature seaborne attack up the Sai Gon River failed, but it frightened
Nguyen Lu into fleeing back to Qui Nhon, where he died shortly after. However,
several Tay Son generals remained at their posts and continued to resist. Ten, the
Khmer ally of the Tay Son, joined them against Nguyen Phuc Anh. Ten’s enemy,
the pro-Siamese Ben, came into the fray on Nguyen Phuc Anh’s side. By the end
of the year, Nguyen Phuc Anh had captured Ten and sent him to Siam.
In the spring of1788, Nguyen Phuc Anh’s battlefield victories were gaining
momentum and Tay Son units began to surrender to him. By summer, Nguyen
Phuc Anh was organizing law and tax regimes in the areas under his control, and
by autumn he had retaken Saigon and was busy setting up a new structure of
government. At that time, Nguyen Hue was preparing another major initiative in
the north, where his ambitions were focused. This, with the shrinking of Nguyen

Nhac’s sphere of action to his provincial domain and Nguyen Lu’s incapacity,
had opened the way for Nguyen Phuc Anh’s return from Siam.
Nguyen Hue, the Quang Trung emperor
When Nguyen Nhac and Nguyen Hue had hastened south to fight each other in
late1786, Nguyen Huu Chinh remained in Nghe An. Nguyen Hue retained his
family as hostages and expected him to watch the north for him. At Ke Cho,
different groups of partisans gathered behind Trinh Bong, a younger brother of
Trinh Khai, and Trinh Le, their uncle. The king took the side of Trinh Bong and
Trinh Le was driven out. Trinh Bong was lazy and lacked political sense, but
among his supporters were men who were determined to re-establish Trinh
dominance over the monarchy. The king was erudite, even bookish, but inexperi-
enced in politics. He wanted to assert the right of his dynasty to rule but was
unsure about how to do this. When it became clear that Trinh Bong was
preparing to attack his palace, he summoned Nguyen Huu Chinh from Nghe An.
Nguyen Huu Chinh marched north, defeating a Trinh army sent against him in
Thanh Hoa. He took control of the capital and sent Trinh Bong and his partisans
fleeing. He began to assume the old role of the Trinh lords. The king was
unhappy but found no way to do anything about it. By summer1787, Nguyen
Hue had returned to Phu Xuan from fighting with his elder brother. He inter-
preted Nguyen Huu Chinh’s activities at Ke Cho as insubordination. He was also
wary of people he knew to have been close to his elder brother, and Nguyen Huu
Chinh was such a person. He sent Vo Van Nham to occupy Nghe An and
summoned Nguyen Huu Chinh. Nguyen Huu Chinh did not come, being in
the midst of a series of campaigns against his enemies in the north, including
Trinh Bong, whom he finally drove across the Qing border. The king sent a royal
uncle and an elderly scholar who had been Nguyen Huu Chinh’s teacher on a
fool’s errand to demand that Nguyen Hue evacuate Nghe An. Nguyen Hue
drowned both of these men in a river and ordered Vo Van Nham to march north
against Nguyen Huu Chinh.
In late1787, Vo Van Nham defeated Nguyen Huu Chinh in Thanh Hoa and
advanced to occupy Ke Cho. He captured and killed Nguyen Huu Chinh, but the
king escaped into the countryside where several leaders rallied armies in his
support. As Vo Van Nham was busy fighting these armies, he got himself into
a feud with a subordinate general, Ngo Van So. Ngo Van So reported to Nguyen
Hue that Vo Van Nham was disloyal. Nguyen Hue was inclined to believe this
because Vo Van Nham was a brother-in-law of Nguyen Nhac, with whom he
had just been fighting. Nguyen Hue, riding hard with a cavalry unit, suddenly

appeared at Ke Cho in summer1788. Vo Van Nham protested his innocence but
Nguyen Hue reportedly replied:“Even if you are innocent, you still made me
worry, and that is already a crime.” He killed Vo Van Nham and replaced him
with Ngo Van So. He met with government officials at the capital and left affairs
in charge of men he trusted. Realizing that more soldiers were needed to control
the north, he returned to Phu Xuan to raise new armies.
While the king was wandering about the countryside with his partisans, his
mother had gone to the Le dynasty’s suzerain in the north and asked for help.
The governor general of the“two Guangs” (i.e. Guangdong and Guangxi, the
southernmost provinces of the Qing Empire), Sun Shiyi, was eager to gain
martial glory, and he strongly pressed the Qing court to approve action. The
Qianlong emperor (r.1735–1796) was not interested in territorial expansion in
the south, but, taking his duty as an overlord seriously, he approved a limited
expedition to support Le dynasty forces in taking back their capital.
When he heard that an army had been mobilized from Qing border provinces
and was about to enter the country, King Le Duy Khiem sent envoys to meet with
the Qing commanders as they marched to Ke Cho. In autumn1788 the Qing
army occupied Ke Cho and Ngo Van So withdrew to Thanh Hoa. Le Duy Khiem
was restored to his palace, where he fruitlessly urged the Qing to advance against
Nguyen Hue. The Qing remained inactive, having achieved their objective of
returning their vassal king to his throne.
The Qing court did not want what they considered to be a small operation to
expand into a large commitment, and, furthermore, there were doubts among
informed Qing officials about the future of the Le dynasty. Qing authorities were
in the process of preparing to withdraw when, at the time of the1789 lunar new
year celebration, Nguyen Hue suddenly burst upon them. Having proclaimed
himself emperor in Phu Xuan, he rushed his armies north and pushed the Qing
troops into and across the Red River.
The scholars assisting Nguyen Hue quickly negotiated peace with the Qing
court, sending apologies, tribute, and appropriate words of submission. As part
of the settlement, Nguyen Hue was to attend Emperor Qianlong’s eightieth
birthday celebration in1790. According to Vietnamese historians, a maternal
kinsman of Nguyen Hue named Pham Cong Tri, who looked very much like
him, went in his place, pretending to be him. Although Qing officials learned of
the ruse, they kept quiet about it to avoid embarrassment and any further
involvement in Vietnamese affairs.
What is known about Nguyen Hue makes it very unlikely that he would have
been able to observe the strict ritual and protocol at the Qing imperial court
without producing some unseemly outburst. This, as much as the pleasure of
tricking the suzerain, lay behind the decision to send a double. Also, Nguyen Hue

lacked the trust in his subordinates that would be necessary for him to be absent
for several months. While Nguyen Phuc Anh spent years crafting a complex
administrative structure and carefully building up his strength at Saigon, Nguyen
Hue, during the four brief years of his reign, left the details of government to
his entourage of officials and gave his attention to plans for a new capital and
for invading the Qing Empire.
Nguyen Hue ruled from Phu Xuan. He began to build a new capital in Nghe
An, near the modern city of Vinh, halfway between Phu Xuan and Ke Cho, but it
was never completed. No administrative reforms or indications of efforts to
address the usual problems of government are attributed to him aside from the
same old recycled measures that had been announced for generations. The
regime of law and taxation that kept public order and produced revenue was
left in the hands of the class of scholar-officials who had attended to these
matters for the Trinh. Some officials remained loyal to the Le and refused to
serve the new emperor, but there was no lack of those who welcomed the
opportunities of the time. Nguyen Hue was not particularly concerned with
administering the flow of tax revenue because he obtained a steady source of
wealth from the many Qing pirates whom he incorporated into his navy and who
preyed upon shipping in the South China Sea.
The only seemingly significant change from past practice was to use vernacular
Vietnamese writing (Nom) rather than the Literary Chinese (Han) in education,
administration, and in official documents. No definite evidence of this has
survived, because Nguyen Phuc Anh supposedly destroyed all such materials in
the early nineteenth century. Yet, there is no reason to doubt that such a change
did occur, for Nom writing was an aspect of new trends in literature during the
eighteenth century.
The first major work in Nom using double-seven-six-eight (luc bat song that)
prosody dates from the1790s in Ke Cho. This is theCung Oan Ngam Khuc
(Complaint from the Harem) of Nguyen Gia Thieu (1741–1798). Nguyen Gia
Thieu was a grandson of Trinh Cuong who feigned madness when Nguyen Hue
expelled the Trinh from Ke Cho. He wrote many poems, but is most noted for his
“Complaint,” which is written in the voice of a woman who was brought to the
royal palace, spent a few glorious moments with the king, and then was left to
spend the rest of her life in loneliness as a harem inmate, complaining bitterly
against Heaven for her fate. The unresolved anger of this work is quite different
from theSong of a Soldier’s Wife written earlier in the century by Dang Tran
Con, in which the wife’s complaint is soothed and released in a final passage
anticipating the return of the husband as a hero.
The use of Nom was probably congenial to Nguyen Hue because of his
educational and career background. He may have studied with the teacher of

Nguyen Nhac, a man named Truong Van Hien who had fled from Phu Xuan
after Truong Phuc Loan had killed his elder brother. Nguyen Hue surely had
at least a rudimentary knowledge ofHan, but Nom was more than likely used
for communicating information and instructions among the officers of his
armies, and commanding soldiers was what he knew and did best. Any effort
to shift from Han to Nom in education and government, however, could not
have achieved any significant resultin the few years that Nguyen Hue osten-
sibly ruled.
The character of Nguyen Hue’s mind is revealed in his plan to attack the Qing
Empire. Rather than focusing his attention upon his implacable foe at Saigon, he
dreamed of annexing the two Qing provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. His
career reveals a perpetual search for new battlefields. He had sent armies to
plunder Laos in1790 and 1791. He had defeated one Qing army, and this made
him think that he could defeat others. Planning to attack the north was more
interesting to him than worrying about old enemies in the south, whom he had
defeated in the past and whom he was convinced could easily be defeated again.
Furthermore, his attention was drawn north by the fleets of Qing pirates who
filled his ports with plunder. The inability of Qing officials to police the coasts of
Guangdong and Guangxi was an indication to him that he could easily take
those provinces. He died in mid1792 at the age of40; at that time he was
constructing large ships to transport war elephants to Guangdong and had sent
envoys to the Qing court with requests for marriage to an imperial princess and
for possession of the two provinces. When news of his death reached the envoys,
they burned their documents and returned.
Nguyen Hue, also known by his imperial title of Quang Trung, became a
famous hero in the accounts of later historians despite the brevity of his reign.
This is because of his battlefield prowess in defeating a Siamese army in the south
and a Chinese army in the north. However, his brilliance on the battlefield was
not matched by his ability to govern. Unlike the men who became founders of
dynasties, he had no mind for the details of administration. While Nguyen Hue
won battles and dreamed of future conquests in the north, Nguyen Phuc Anh
occupied himself with laying the foundation for a new country in the south.
Nguyen Phuc Anh at Saigon
In1792, Nguyen Hue’s 11-year-old son, Nguyen Toan, was placed on the throne
at Phu Xuan, and Bui Dac Tuyen, Nguyen Toan’s maternal uncle, ruled as
regent. Although Nguyen Toan’s court was thereafter troubled with factional
intrigues, for a decade it was a headquarters for marshaling resistance to the

northward advance of Nguyen Phuc Anh’s armies, which by this time were on
the move and threatening Nguyen Nhac at Cha Ban.
After retaking Saigon for the final time in autumn1788, Nguyen Phuc Anh
spent nearly two years establishing an administration to govern the peoples of
Gia Dinh and building up his military forces. One of his first and most enduring
concerns was the lawlessness endemic to the Gia Dinh frontier, particularly after
more than a decade of war. Even before retaking Saigon, as his armies were
advancing, he emphasized his prohibition on raping and plundering by
beheading two offenders. In mid1789 he sent men to punish bandits, bullies,
and officials who were oppressing people at My Tho and Vinh Long. Shortly
after this, he published harsh punishments for robbers, particularly for soldiers
who robbed. In following years he repeatedly sent out soldiers to suppress
bandits. People suffered not only from human predators. In1789, rewards were
posted for the death or capture of a tiger that was preying on a village near Bien
Hoa, north of Saigon. On the other hand, to help restore a more normal agrarian
life, water buffalo were sent to the My Tho area because so many of these useful
animals had been killed in that strategic region during the wars.
Even more than suppressing lawlessness, Nguyen Phuc Anh sought to encour-
age a law-abiding and productive mode of life. Gambling was forbidden among
the Vietnamese, although it was allowed and taxed among the Chinese. Sorcery
and séances were discouraged because they took attention away from the real
world, where Nguyen Phuc Anh was marshaling resources. Men were urged to
work and not to cultivate lazy habits. Men with an inclination to study were
encouraged with exemptions from corvée and military conscription.
Nguyen Phuc Anh published an amnesty for those who had ignored his
summons to contribute manpower and supplies when he first returned from
Siam in1787. While he accepted those who had rallied to him in autumn of
1787 when he was at Long Xuyen, those who waited to rally behind him until
after his advance to Vinh Long in early summer1788, only four months before
he retook Saigon, were punished for their tardiness. He later published an
amnesty for“good people” who, being unfamiliar with all the new laws he
was publishing, found themselves in trouble. He established a granary in Saigon
to feed the stream of refugees from the north coming to join him. He kept a sharp
eye on public morale and repeatedly solicited comments and ideas from both
subordinates and common people.
His first recorded act upon retaking Saigon was to establish a court where he
regularly discussed public affairs with the leaders of his entourage. There was
apparently a disorderly chorus of comments about what needed to be done, for
one month later he issued rules for the proper way to make comments and
complaints. Perhaps these rules inhibited open discussion, so a few weeks later

he announced a policy to encourage people to freely voice their ideas, asserting
that no one would be punished for bad ideas. Shortly after that, a“suggestion
box” was set out to facilitate the flow of thought. In spring1790, Nguyen Phuc
Anh assigned scribes the task of writing down everything that was said in his
presence. He was said to have given close attention to all details of government.
Within days of retaking Saigon he sent officials out to all the administrative
jurisdictions to check the tax and conscription records. He then immediately
announced a tax policy and established three ministries to deal with the appoint-
ment of civil officials, with military affairs, and with the courts of law. He also
established a Han Lam Academy to prepare his edicts. In1789, a system of local
government offices was established and many appointments were made to fill
them. Particular attention was given to measures for the encouragement of
agriculture and to regularizing local governance. Any locality with at least forty
Vietnamese was required to have a“leader” to be responsible for dealing with
government authorities.
A Tay Son general unable to escape north had sought refuge with the Khmers
in the lower Mekong plain. In early1789 he was forced to surrender, along with
an army of around1,500 Khmers that had been allied with the Tay Son. The
Khmer soldiers were allowed to join Nguyen Phuc Anh’s command on condition
of contributing a certain amount of rice. Khmer officials were then appointed to
govern the Khmer population in the regions of modern Tra Vinh and Can Tho.
Displaced Khmers were given rice to settle down as agriculturalists in that region.
Lawless Vietnamese coveting Khmer land provoked a brief uprising among the
Khmers in late1789.I n1791, Nguyen Phuc Anh decreed that Vietnamese were
not to seize land from Khmers. Khmers were to keep their land and Vietnamese
were to open up new land for cultivation, of which there was“plenty available.”
For their part, Khmers did not have the right to open up new land. The
Vietnamese and Khmers were to keep“separate” from each other. This problem
did not go away, however, and in1798 Nguyen Phuc Anh sent officials to
prevent Vietnamese from taking land away from the Khmers and instead to
send them to open up uncultivated land.
Nguyen Phuc Anh appointed Chinese to govern the Chinese communities that
had developed from the Ming immigrants of the previous century, of which there
were five, for people from Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan, Shanghai, and the
Teochow. These Chinese communities had their own regulations for registering
people for taxation and military conscription and were integrated into the
Vietnamese style of administration. More recent“sojourners” from Qing were
less adapted to local society and Nguyen Phuc Anh kept close watch on their
relatively more predatory economic activities, in particular their penchant for
loaning money to Vietnamese settlers at exorbitant interest rates resulting in the

enslavement of wives and children. In mid1791, laws against such interest rates
were published.
Customs duties for merchant ships of the five Chinese communities were fixed
with the highest rates being placed on the ships of Guangdong and Shanghai
(3,300 strings of cash), then Fujian (2,400 strings), Teochow (1,200 strings), and
Hainan (650 strings). Chinese merchants who brought iron, zinc, and sulphur,
all being important for military purposes, were exempt from duties and received
an allotment of rice, but they were required to sell their goods to the government.
Severe punishments were published against ship owners smuggling goods out of
Gia Dinh. Currency regulations were published enforcing the acceptance of
chipped or worn coins so long as they could still be kept on strings. The price
of sugar was regulated to encourage European merchants to bring weapons in
trade.
The management of military manpower was Nguyen Phuc Anh’s most critical
concern. In early1789 men were required to register for conscription. Those who
had served in the Tay Son armies but failed to register were subject to the penalty
of death. Parents were allowed to keep one son at home to care for them. Severe
punishments for draft dodgers and deserters extended to their families, and
rewards were posted for those providing information about the whereabouts of
these fugitives. Soldiers were warned against bothering people or harassing
merchants and were forbidden to carry their weapons unless they were on duty.
Entertainers could not be enrolled in the ranks because Nguyen Phuc Anh
believed their presence in the army would damage martial valor, although they
were allowed to perform for soldiers under certain restrictions.
In addition to regular units, there were also local militia units. In1790,
regulations for establishing peasant-soldier settlements (don dien) were published
and incentives were posted for officials to organize such settlements in the Vam
Co region west of Saigon. Initially, conscription mobilizations were scheduled at
three-year intervals, but as battlefield activity accelerated during the1790s they
became annual procedures. With an infusion of men into the military, Nguyen
Phuc Anh organized instruction for his officers in training, discipline, supply, and
battlefield behavior.
Nguyen Phuc Anh gave particular attention to the system of supply for his
men. Rice granaries were established and, throughout the succeeding years of
warfare, provisions for building new granaries and for moving rice to the battle-
fronts were an integral part of planning troop movements. Nguyen Phuc Anh’s
victories rested in large part upon his mastery of the problems of supply. In order
to move rice and men and supplies, ships were necessary, and shipbuilding was a
constant and urgent priority. No sooner had Saigon been retaken in1788 than
Nguyen Phuc Anh sent soldiers to cut lumber and transport it down to the

shipyards. Instructions for maintaining the supply of lumber for the shipyards
are mentioned repeatedly during succeeding years. The Gia Dinh shipbuilding
industry, at Saigon and at My Tho, became very large in the1790s, producing
hundreds of ships with innovative designs that came to be coveted by rulers and
merchants in neighboring countries.
Con Dao Island was used for breeding and raising horses, which were then
transported to Gia Dinh and trained for the battlefield. Blacksmiths, gunsmiths,
and metalworkers of all kinds were put under the supervision of officials and
mobilized to produce weapons. Men were sent to Guangdong to buy chemicals
for military purposes, and weapons were bought in markets throughout the
region, including Portuguese Macau and Goa and Dutch Batavia. A reliable
source of weapons was the Sultanate of Johore, where Mahmud Shaz III
(r.1761–1811) maintained a friendly relationship with Nguyen Phuc Anh and
kept a market well stocked with guns, bullets, sulphur, and saltpeter. During the
1790s, Nguyen Phuc Anh repeatedly sent men to buy war materials from him.
During his years of exile, Nguyen Phuc Anh had entrusted his eldest son,
Prince Canh, to the French missionary Pierre Pigneau. Pigneau proposed to go
to France and negotiate a treaty with the French government on behalf of
Nguyen Phuc Anh and thereby obtain military assistance for his cause. Prince
Canh and two of Nguyen Phuc Anh’s officers accompanied Pigneau to demon-
strate the legitimacy of the mission. After spending most of 1787 in Paris,
Pigneau secured a treaty, which proved to be worthless as the French government
was bankrupt and on the verge of revolution. Pigneau and Prince Canh arrived in
French Pondicherry, on the coast of India, in spring of1788. Realizing that the
French authorities were not going to honor the treaty, Pigneau spent the next
year raising funds and recruiting deserters from the French navy. He purchased
two merchant vessels, armed them, and filled them with military supplies.
Manned by fewer than one hundred French deserters, along with a few Portu-
guese and Asian volunteers, these ships arrived at Saigon in summer1789.
Most of the Frenchmen who arrived at this time left within two or three years,
disappointed by the lack of opportunity for monetary enrichment and disgusted
by what they viewed as Nguyen Phuc Anh’s inaction. Among the few who
remained longer were about a dozen naval officers. The French were the smallest
group among the diverse collection of non-Vietnamese to be found in Nguyen
Phuc Anh’s armies in the1790s: Chinese, Chams, Ede, Malays, Khmers, Siamese,
Laotians, and Portuguese. The French exercised little, if any, influence over
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s government or battle plans. But they did contribute to the
training and organization of some military units, particularly in the navy.
Four officers who arrived with Pigneau drilled the navy in battle formations. In
the early years, they frequently sailed with Nguyen Phuc Anh ’s fleets in

command of ships and sometimes provided battlefield leadership. They were
Jean Marie Dayot (1759–1809), Jean Baptiste Chaigneau (1769–1832), Philippe
Vannier (1762–1842), and Godefroy de Forsans (d.1811). Dayot was particu-
larly active in naval affairs. With the assistance of his brother, he drafted maps of
the Vietnamese coast. He departed in1795 when Nguyen Phuc Anh humiliated
him for having accidentally run his ship aground. Chaigneau and Vannier
became Vietnamized, established local families, and remained in Nguyen Phuc
Anh’s service after the end of the war. Less is known about Forsans, but he
remained in Vietnam until his death.
Another Frenchman who served Nguyen Phuc Anh was Olivier de Puymanel
(1768–1799). He did not arrive with Pigneau but had deserted from a French
warship visiting Con Dao Island shortly before the return of Pigneau and Prince
Canh. He was trained as a construction engineer. In1790 he supervised the
construction of the citadel at Saigon following the most recent European ideas in
fortification. Théodore Lebrun (at Saigon1790–1791), another officer who had
deserted from the French fleet, assisted in drawing up plans for the city and the
citadel, but he became disgruntled and left after a year. Puymanel remained and
also drilled Nguyen Phuc Nguyen’s land soldiers in infantry formations and
tactics and trained them in the use of mobile artillery. He frequently traveled to
buy weapons in various regional ports and died in Malacca, only31 years old.
Laurent Barizy (1769–1802), a friend of Puymanel’s who entered Nguyen Phuc
Anh’s service in 1793, spent most of his time buying military supplies in
Malacca, Manila, and Batavia.
The role of Pierre Pigneau and the small group of French naval officers was a
palpable ingredient in Nguyen Phuc Anh’s ultimate success because of their
contributions to organizing and drilling both naval and land forces, their expert-
ise in constructing fortifications, their efforts to obtain supplies of up-to-date
weapons, and their occasional leadership in battle. However, they were but a
small part of what became a huge military organization that included thousands
of men from several countries. Their role is testimony to Nguyen Phuc Anh’s
ability to understand and to make use of them more than it is of any French
influence on him, which, in any case, is meaningless and anachronistic in that
time and place. Very few of the Frenchmen who arrived in Saigon remained after
1792. Most of those who did became personally loyal to Nguyen Phuc Anh,
established families with Vietnamese wives, and intended to remain among the
Vietnamese for the rest of their lives.
Nguyen Phuc Anh understood how to maximize the assets of Saigon as an
international seaport with a rich agricultural hinterland and a shipbuilding
industry. Within a few years he mastered the Saigon region with an efficient civil
government capable of organizing and supplying large expeditionary forces.

Having experienced many defeats, he was unimpressed with the outcome of any
single battle. His was a long-term vision that he pursued with method and
persistence.
From Saigon to Dien Khanh
Unlike traditional Vietnamese warfare in northern Vietnam that was conducted
during the winter dry season when north winds blew from the continent into the
sea, Nguyen Phuc Anh’s campaigns were organized to catch the south winds that
blew from the sea from late spring into autumn. His basic strategy was to move
north by sea with the winds, landing troops and supplies to support the advance
of land armies. When the winds changed he would return to Saigon with his fleet
and leave land forces in defensive positions to hold off the enemy until the
following year when the south winds returned.
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s first experiment with this type of warfare was in1790
when he ordered an advance up the coast into Binh Thuan. This was a dry region
that produced little rice. There were no important harbors. The Cham popula-
tion was concentrated here and had provided strong support to Nguyen Nhac.
After initial success in marching north through Binh Thuan, Nguyen Phuc Anh’s
generals floundered in confusion when Nguyen Nhac counterattacked. By the
end of the year, Nguyen Phuc Anh had withdrawn his forces back to their
starting point at Ba Ria.
During the following year, Nguyen Phuc Anh concentrated upon rebuilding
the morale of his officers after the dismaying Binh Thuan campaign. He also
strengthened his military forces, dealt with a drought, spread propaganda in the
north, and nurtured his alliance with Siam. This was the first year that the
conscription procedure among Vietnamese was made annual. New army units
were organized with volunteers from the Chinese communities. Military colonies
(don dien) were established among the Chinese at Long Xuyen, among the
Khmers at Can Tho, and among the Vietnamese at Ba Ria. Lumber was brought
from Cambodia to the My Tho shipyard and some one hundred ships were built.
The Saigon shipyard was building ships that could carry twenty-six to thirty-six
cannon and over three hundred men.
Rice was purchased in Siam to alleviate near famine conditions caused by
drought, and measures were taken to keep local rice from being hoarded or made
into wine. People continued to arrive from the north, and they had to be
examined to sort out loyal people from spies. Meanwhile spies were sent into
the north to inspect conditions there and to spread songs of nostalgia for the
Nguyen Phuc and of anticipation for the south wind that would bring the

Nguyen Phuc back to power. Literary examinations were held to test knowledge
of history and the ability to think about current events. Those who achieved the
best grades were assigned to teach in government schools. Others received tax
and conscription exemptions and were assigned to continue their studies. Shrines
were built for the souls of those who had perished in battle.
The Laotian king had captured some of Nguyen Hue’s soldiers, banners, and
drums during Nguyen Hue’s expedition into Laos of this year. He sent these to
his Siamese overlord, who forwarded them to Nguyen Phuc Anh. Nguyen Phuc
Anh sent an envoy to Chakri at Bangkok conveying his appreciation. The envoy
was also instructed to explain to Chakri that, although there were bound to be
tensions and unfortunate events along the Khmer–Viet border, Nguyen Phuc
Anh regarded Cambodia as a Siamese vassal and would refer all matters
regarding Cambodia to him. The two kings throughout their reigns maintained
a plausible appearance of trust.
In 1792, Nguyen Phuc Anh waited until his spies reported a large enemy fleet
at Qui Nhon, Nguyen Nhac’s harbor. He sent his fleet, which captured the
enemy ships and briefly occupied Qui Nhon before returning to Saigon. During
this operation, his land soldiers advanced as far as Phan Rang before turning
back to Ba Ria when the winds changed. Cham leaders in Binh Thuan pledged
loyalty to Nguyen Phuc Anh, and a good harvest brought an end to the famine
laws. News from the north was also encouraging. After Nguyen Hue’s death,
tension between Nguyen Nhac and the leaders at Phu Xuan had prevented
Nguyen Nhac from attending his brother’s funerary rites.
In 1791 and 1792, the relationship between Nguyen Phuc Anh and Pierre
Pigneau was nearly broken over the issue of Pigneau’s role as teacher and mentor
of Prince Canh. Nguyen Phuc Anh was dismayed by his son’s fidelity to his
Christian education in rejecting certain features of local culture, in particular the
veneration of his ancestors. He consequently relieved Pigneau of his responsi-
bilities as Prince Canh’s teacher. He was also impatient with Pigneau’s incessant
urgings to attack the Tay Son before he considered the time to be propitious. At
one point, Pigneau threatened to leave. By1793, however, after much discussion
between the two men, mutual accommodations opened the way for reconcili-
ation. Pigneau was reinstated as Prince Canh’s mentor, Prince Canh emerged
from adolescence and became more tolerant of local practices, and Nguyen Phuc
Anh was ready to move north.
Nguyen Phuc Anh’s south wind campaign of1793 was a success that greatly
advanced his battlefield position. In preparation for it, early in the year he issued
an edict calling on the people to abandon lazy habits and work hard to serve the
country. He also issued a call for special efforts against thieves and bandits. He
then began to mobilize his soldiers, including an army of Khmers and an army

recruited from upland peoples. Families of soldiers, including the Khmers,
received tax exemptions. Qing, Siamese, and French were serving in the
fleet along with the Vietnamese.
In the fifth lunar month, with a strong south wind, Nguyen Phuc Anh took his
fleet up the coast and seized Nha Trang, where he was joined by his land armies.
His land and sea forces then advanced through Phu Yen and, after heavy
fighting, captured strategic positions around Cha Ban, Nguyen Nhac’s capital,
and the seaport of Qui Nhon. While his armies were occupied with taking the
surrender of enemy soldiers and with collecting weapons at Cha Ban and Qui
Nhon, Nguyen Phuc Anh took his fleet north to Quang Ngai where he rallied
supporters from among the local population and fought several battles against
armies from Phu Xuan seeking to come to Nguyen Nhac’s assistance.
As the winds began to change, Nguyen Phuc Anh withdrew his forces to Phu
Yen. He then mobilized some four thousand men from Binh Thuan to build a
fortress at Dien Khanh, under the supervision of Olivier de Puymanel. Dien
Khanh, about fifteen kilometers west of Nha Trang, is the modern capital of
Khanh Hoa Province. It is strategically located to guard the way south out of the
Nha Trang region. A system of post houses and storehouses in Binh Thuan
linking Gia Dinh with Dien Khanh was established. Nguyen Phuc Anh was
determined to defend Dien Khanh at all costs.
Leadership among Nguyen Phuc Anh’s enemies weakened as a result of the
1793 battles. Nguyen Nhac died, reportedly in a fit of chagrin because his
generals did not follow his commands during the battles around his capital.
His son and heir, Nguyen Bao, immediately began to quarrel with the leaders
at Phu Xuan. But the building of the Dien Khanh fortress gave these men a target
against which they could unite, at least temporarily. The fighting of the next two
years was basically an unsuccessful effort by the Phu Xuan generals to seize Dien
Khanh. Nguyen Phuc Anh had succeeded in shifting the focus of battle to a place
of his choosing.
During the1793–1794 dry season, virtually all of Nguyen Phuc Anh’s activ-
ities were oriented toward strengthening Dien Khanh. Ships and weapons were
being produced as fast as possible. Militia units were organized in Binh Thuan
and in the region of Dien Khanh. Men from Quang Ngai who had rallied during
the1793 fighting were organized into an army. Dien Khanh was reinforced
not only with Vietnamese soldiers but also with units of Khmers, Siamese,
and Malays. Cham soldiers at Dien Khanh were released to serve in their home
province of Binh Thuan as supply troops. A Cham leader who supported the Tay
Son was captured and killed. Vietnamese settlers were assigned to work the fields
that had been abandoned by Chams in Binh Thuan. Amidst all of this, Nguyen
Phuc Anh arranged to sell rice to Siam to alleviate a famine there.

When, in spring1794, a large Tay Son army marched into Phu Yen, forcing his
men to retreat, Nguyen Phuc Anh hastened rice and men to Dien Khanh. Shortly
after, the Tay Son advanced to attack Dien Khanh. By this time the south wind
allowed Nguyen Phuc Anh to set sail with his fleet. News of this led to the Tay
Son withdrawing back to Phu Yen. Nguyen Phuc Anh advanced to Phu Yen,
fought many battles there, and also sent seaborne forces to disrupt Tay Son
communications in Quang Ngai. Reinforcements were summoned to the Phu
Yen battlefront as he visited Dien Khanh and ordered repairs to the fortress. The
Siamese soldiers at Dien Khanh were allowed to return to their country. Officials
in Saigon were instructed to issue them their pay as they passed through. Before
returning to Saigon, Nguyen Phuc Anh endeavored to resolve problems caused
by sending Vietnamese to cultivate former Cham lands in Binh Thuan. He
ordered Vietnamese officials to consult with Cham officials to adjudicate bound-
ary disputes fairly so that the two peoples could live together in peace.
Shortly after the winds changed to the north in late1794, the Tay Son returned
to the offensive. As they fought their way south through Phu Yen and to the walls
of Dien Khanh, Nguyen Phuc Anh rushed supplies and reinforcements to Vo
Tanh, the commander at Dien Khanh. By the end of the year, after heavy
fighting, the Tay Son armies had Dien Khanh under siege and were advancing
into Binh Thuan.
Within a few weeks, by early1795, the Tay Son had pushed all the way to Ba
Ria. An army of1,500 Khmers was organized in Tra Vinh and, along with other
Gia Dinh militia and reserve units, was ordered forward. The Tay Son forces
were pushed back. Meanwhile, Nguyen Phuc Anh was with his fleet, filled with
supplies and troops, waiting for the winds to change. When they did, he sailed to
Nha Trang to disembark an army to relieve Dien Khanh, then continued to Phu
Yen to disembark another army to block the Tay Son from escaping back north.
During the next four months, fighting raged from Binh Thuan to Phu Yen.
Defeated in Binh Thuan, Tay Son forces withdrew and joined the armies
besieging Dien Khanh. At the same time, an army of uplanders helped Nguyen
Phuc Anh to obtain an important victory in Phu Yen.
Meanwhile, in Phu Xuan, murderous feuds broke into the open. A general
named Vo Van Dung killed the regent, Bui Dac Tuyen. The general besieging
Dien Khanh, Tran Quang Dieu, was a supporter of Bui Dac Tuyen, so Vo Van
Dung sent agents to kill him. Before this could come to pass, the siege of Dien
Khanh was broken when a Tay Son deserter revealed a mountain path that
allowed a unit of Saigon soldiers to pry open the Tay Son position. The Tay
Son armies fled north as their generals raced back to Phu Xuan to join the
struggle for power. Eventually, Phu Xuan leadership was reorganized as a
coalition of four powerful generals, each of whom desired supremacy. Two of

these generals were Vo Van Dung and Tran Quang Dieu. Nguyen Toan, the
young king, was powerless.
For three years, the war had centered on Dien Khanh, a fortress built at a place
chosen by Nguyen Phuc Anh as his first step up the coast from Saigon. The
failure of his enemies to take Dien Khanh and their lack of unity made it possible
for him to advance the focus of warfare further north into Binh Dinh.
From Dien Khanh to Binh Dinh
After breaking the nine-month siege of Dien Khanh, Nguyen Phuc Anh spent
1796reorganizing his armies, making new appointments, inspecting agriculture,
holding a literary examination, building ships, buying weapons, training horses,
conscripting soldiers, and admonishing his generals, who were wasting their spare
time on gambling and cockfights. When the south winds arrived in1797, he seized
the port of Qui Nhon and then advanced to Quang Nam. While some of his
generals attacked up the Thu Bon River to Hoi An and Dien Ban, he disembarked
in Da Nang Bay and attacked up toward Hai Van Pass. Troops raised in Quang
Ngai joined his armies and fighting raged from Phu Yen to Quang Nam for three
months until the winds changed and Nguyen Phuc Anh returned to Saigon.
Nguyen Phuc Anh spent the last months of the year1797 dealing with Chams
who had been serving with the Tay Son armies and had returned to Binh Thuan,
provoking uprisings and unrest. Siamese troops assisted in calming this problem,
perhaps in return for Vietnamese troops helping to suppress an uprising of
minority peoples in Cambodia a short time before. At this time, discussions were
initiated to coordinate Siamese and Lao troops with Nguyen Phuc Anh’s future
campaigns by having them march over the mountains and down the Ca River
valley into Nghe An to threaten the Tay Son from behind. A diplomatic initiative
was also taken to cultivate good will with the Qing Empire. Qing pirates
captured from the Tay Son fleets were sent into the custody of Qing authorities
in Guangdong.
In 1798, Nguyen Phuc Anh bought weapons, built ships, reorganized supply
lines, mobilized and trained soldiers, reinforced his front-line units at Dien
Khanh and Ca Pass, and dealt with the problem of deserting soldiers by
imprisoning their families. In early1799 he was laying plans for another south
wind campaign. He published thirty-six articles on military discipline, which give
an indication of the serious expectations he had for upcoming operations, for
they had much to say about behavior in time of battlefield victories, behavior
toward prisoners, and behavior toward the civilian population of newly occupied
areas.

Nguyen Phuc Anh had several talented generals, but by this time none of them
had been with him longer than Le Van Duyet (1764–1832). Le Van Duyet was
originally from Quang Ngai, where Nguyen Cu Trinh had served in the early
1750s, a place known for poverty and lawlessness. He was reportedly born
without genitals and began his career as a eunuch at Phu Xuan. He first appears
in Nguyen Phuc Anh’s entourage in the late1770s, during the years of fighting
and fleeing from the Tay Son armies in Gia Dinh. He was known to be austere
and humorless, often prickly with colleagues and always strict toward subordin-
ates. Yet, through the years, he assembled a large“family” of talented men
whom he adopted as sons, and he was utterly devoted to Nguyen Phuc Anh.
Although Le Van Duyet had served prominently in previous campaigns, in1799
he emerged as a versatile and reliable commander whom Nguyen Phuc Anh
would increasingly rely upon in the final years of war.
In late spring of1799, Nguyen Phuc Anh sailed with his war fleet, followed by
his supply fleet, to Nha Trang. After consulting with Prince Canh, who was in
command at Dien Khanh, he ordered his land forces to march north through Phu
Yen toward Cha Ban. Nguyen Phuc Anh sailed ahead and seized the port of Qui
Nhon, assisted by dissention among the Tay Son generals there. He then sent Le
Van Duyet to northern Binh Dinh Province to block Tay Son armies marching
south. Le Van Duyet rallied Ede chieftains in the mountains to assist in barring
the passes leading from Quang Ngai into Binh Dinh. The Tay Son armies came
through the passes in two columns. One of the columns dissolved in panic when
a forward scout shouted“nai! ” upon seeing a herd of deer.Nai is the word for
“deer,” but it was also northern slang for soldiers from Gia Dinh, deriving from
the Dong Nai (“deer field”) River where Vietnamese first began to settle in the
Mekong region. Soldiers following the scout picked up the cry of“Nai! Nai!”
This filled the column with fear of an ambush and provoked a stampede to the
rear. The Tay Son soldiers were no longer as fearsome as they had been twenty-
five years before.
Meanwhile, Nguyen Phuc Anh defeated a Tay Son fleet as his land forces
advanced and took Nguyen Nhac’s old capital, Cha Ban, near the modern city of
An Nhon. In this campaign, a Vietnamese general leading a force of Khmers with
Siamese officers rallied upland peoples to assist along the mountain flanks. It was
at this time that the province received its modern name, as Nguyen Phuc Anh
called it Binh Dinh, meaning“pacified” or “put in order” or “set right.”
Nguyen Phuc Anh spent over three months in Binh Dinh, collecting rice,
organizing supplies, recruiting soldiers, appointing administrators, fixing taxes,
selecting students, seeking out those who had remained loyal, honoring the dead,
building storehouses, organizing post stations, and positioning his soldiers,
including a force of ten thousand Siamese. Over one thousand men from Binh

Dinh were selected for their“strength and quickness” and trained to handle
artillery. Pierre Pigneau, who accompanied Prince Canh on this campaign, died
of dysentery in Binh Dinh during this time. Nguyen Phuc Anh brought his body
back to Saigon and gave him a burial with honor.
The Tay Son generals continued their feuds. Two of them, the erstwhile
enemies Vo Van Dung and Tran Quang Dieu, were now yoked together on the
southern border of Quang Ngai, making plans to march south when the winds
changed. At Saigon, Nguyen Phuc Anh was occupied with building ships, mobil-
izing metalworkers to produce weapons, tracking down bandits, and raising
more soldiers, including an army of five thousand Khmers. Meanwhile, the
Tay Son armies advanced, enveloped, and besieged Cha Ban in early1800.V o
Tanh, Nguyen Phuc Anh’s commander at Cha Ban, had been left with orders to
resist until the south wind brought reinforcements. Once again, as in1795 at
Dien Khanh, Vo Tanh found himself in command of the pivot in Nguyen Phuc
Anh’s strategic position and under siege.
After suppressing a Cham uprising in the Phan Rang area and mobilizing
Khmers to pacify marauding uplanders north of Saigon, Nguyen Phuc Anh
started his land forces marching north and prepared to sail as soon as the
winds changed. Ships bearing rice sent by his ally, Chakri of Siam, joined his
supply fleet. At the beginning of summer, Nguyen Phuc Anh arrived at Nha
Trang and met with his land forces at Dien Khanh before sending them
forward into Phu Yen, which for months had been disturbed by Tay Son
forays and one of his generals who had turned traitor. When he received word
that the King of Cambodia had sent an army of five thousand men and ten
e l e p h a n t s ,N g u y e nP h u cA n hi n s t r u c t e dP r i n c eC a n ha tS a i g o nt os e n dt he
Khmers north.
Phu Yen was in a state of seemingly irremediable disorder with detachments of
Tay Son troops, bands of traitors, large numbers of deserters, camps of the sick
and wounded, and demoralized soldiers resisting discipline. Most of Nguyen Phuc
Anh’s generals wanted to withdraw, citing enemy strength and sinking morale.
Time was passing. If something were not done soon, the winds would change, and
they would be blown back to Saigon leaving Vo Tanh behind and a trail of
confusion.
Nguyen Phuc Anh refused to accept this impasse. News arrived that his Lao
allies were attacking into Nghe An assisted by the uplanders of that province. He
turned to Le Van Duyet and ordered him to advance. Le Van Duyet pushed
forward into Binh Dinh and reached the Tay Son siege walls, but could go no
further. Nevertheless, Nguyen Phuc Anh’s ships seized a Tay Son supply fleet on
the northern coast of Binh Dinh and, shortly after, captured a fleet of Qing
pirates in Tay Son service.

At this point, Nguyen Phuc Anh made a fateful decision. This year, he would
not return south with the north wind. The greatest problem this posed was how
to maintain the rice supply to his armies during the winter. He sent an urgent
message to Saigon to build more ships to carry that year’s harvest north before
the winds shifted. Then he ordered that a system of transporting rice north by
land be established. He finally solved the problem by mobilizing great numbers
of small fishing boats to carry rice north, hugging the coast amidst contrary
winds. He then ordered up more soldiers from Saigon.
In late 1800, Le Van Duyet, guided by allies among upland peoples, shifted
behind the backs of Vo Tanh’s besiegers and broke into the lowlands of Binh
Dinh. A few weeks later, in early1801, Le Van Duyet used fireships to seize the
port of Qui Nhon. These victories dramatically changed the battlefield situation
in Nguyen Phuc Anh’s favor, significantly strengthening his position in Binh
Dinh. Just at that moment, news arrived that Prince Canh had died of smallpox.
How Nguyen Phuc Anh was affected by this news is not known, but he then
made another fateful decision. It was as if the death of his son in Saigon somehow
turned him away from that place, which had been his temporary home for many
years, and sent him back toward his ancestral home where he had spent his
youth. He decided to leave behind the turmoil in Phu Yen and the ensnarled
armies in Binh Dinh and instead to proceed north to take Phu Xuan.
A new peace
Sending word to his Laotian allies to renew their attacks, he sailed to Hoi An,
landing troops to join with local men from Quang Ngai and Quang Nam who
rallied to his banner. After collecting rice in Quang Nam and capturing more
Qing pirates at sea, he sailed to Da Nang Bay and advanced to Phu Xuan. Tay
Son forces offered little resistance as Phu Xuan fell and Nguyen Toan fled to the
north. Nguyen Phuc Anh secured the old border at the Gianh River as his Lao
and uplander allies attacked Nghe An and Thanh Hoa. It was now summer
1801, and just as Nguyen Phuc Anh paused to savor his victory, word came that
Vo Tanh, out of provisions, had committed suicide, and Cha Ban had fallen to
the Tay Son generals, Vo Van Dung and Tran Quang Dieu. This Tay Son victory
was nearly meaningless, however, for the focus of war had shifted further north
and the Tay Son army in Binh Dinh, although large and still potent, was little
more than the residue from an earlier phase of fighting.
During the last half of1801, Nguyen Phuc Anh prepared for an expected
counterattack from Nguyen Toan in the north, began to form a government at
Phu Xuan, and arranged for the supply of his armies. Le Van Duyet was ordered

to contain the Tay Son army in Binh Dinh while the walls at Dong Hoi were
repaired and garrisoned. A few battles were fought with Tay Son forces around
the Gianh River, followed by another Laotian thrust into Nghe An. The Cam Lo
Road to Laos was mapped and garrisoned. Naval forces captured more Qing
pirates.
In Thuan Hoa, Nguyen Phuc Anh searched for descendents of the“old honor
roll of 1558,” which enumerated all those who had come south with Nguyen
Hoang in that year. He found469 people. He repaired the tombs of his ancestors
that had been despoiled by Nguyen Hue. He also dug up and exposed Nguyen
Hue’s corpse and executed thirty-one of Nguyen Hue’s descendents and generals.
He began to spend more time reading history books and discussing them with
scholars, pondering his own place in history.
Nguyen Toan had spent this time mobilizing an army in the north. Near the end
of the year, after the rains had stopped, he appeared at the border along with a fleet
of more than one hundred Qing pirate ships. Nguyen Phuc Anh took up his
position at the walls as his ancestors had done in the past. The battle that ensued
in the early weeks of1802 was a ghostly echo of the seventeenth-century cam-
paigns. Nguyen Toan advanced to the Tran Ninh Wall where southern gunners
inflicted high casualties on his men. When Nguyen Phuc Anh’s fleet captured
twenty of the Qing pirate ships and turned back the rest, Nguyen Toan began to
retreat. Nguyen Phuc Anh sent his ships to the Gianh River, where they captured
Nguyen Toan’s supply fleet and prevented most of his army from crossing the
river. A Siamese army of five thousand men with allied Laotians appeared from the
mountains in Nghe An and hastened Nguyen Toan’s flight back to Ke Cho.
Nguyen Phuc Anh returned to Phu Xuan, repaired the palaces, rested his
soldiers, and waited for the fighting in Binh Dinh to end. Many of his soldiers
were from Thuan Hoa and had traveled to Saigon years before to join his armies.
He now allowed these men to visit their families. Sick and wounded soldiers from
Gia Dinh were sent home, and families of Gia Dinh soldiers still on duty in
Thuan Hoa were instructed to write letters to give them news of home. Nguyen
Phuc Anh continued his reading of history and his discussions with scholars. He
understood that he was on the verge of an unprecedented situation and he
wanted the perspective of educated men.
Binh Dinh fell in late spring. The Tay Son generals with around three thousand
of their men escaped into the mountains and tried to return north. Very few of
them succeeded in reaching their goal as Nguyen Phuc Anh ordered his men into
the valleys of Quang Nam and Thuan Hoa to block their way and sent messages
to alert his Siamese and Laotian allies to watch for them.
Shortly after receiving news of victory in Binh Dinh, Nguyen Phuc Anh raised
for discussion the question of whether the Le dynasty was dead or alive.

Everyone agreed that it was dead. Having already proclaimed himself king,
Nguyen Phuc Anh now took the last step in proclaiming sovereignty by aban-
doning the Le reign title for marking years and publishing his own reign title, Gia
Long, thereby founding the Nguyen dynasty. Accompanying this was a flurry of
conferring ranks of nobility and of appointing a host of officials. Gifts and
honors were given to the Khmer and Siamese generals and they were sent home
with their men. Envoys were sent to Qing to hand over captured pirates.
In mid summer1802, Nguyen Phuc Anh issued an edict to the people in the
north, urging them to render assistance and warning them against lawlessness.
He issued another edict to his men with instructions about the treatment of
prisoners and civilians with strict orders to maintain discipline. He then set out
with his fleet and army for the north. He arrived at Vinh in Nghe An without
encountering any resistance. He spent a few days there reorganizing his supply
system before proceeding to Thanh Hoa, again without encountering any resist-
ance. In Thanh Hoa, he visited the Le dynastic ancestral shrine and received a
hospitable welcome from members of the Le family. With Le Van Duyet leading
the advance, he entered Ke Cho without a battle only thirty days after departing
Phu Xuan. Nguyen Toan and his followers fled the city but were quickly
captured.
Nguyen Phuc Anh spent less than four months at Ke Cho, establishing order in
the north, conscripting soldiers, issuing rules and regulations, appointing offi-
cials, establishing an ancestral shrine for the Trinh family, and sending envoys to
Qing. In autumn, he sent his soldiers back south and returned to Phu Xuan.
There, he presided over Nguyen Toan’s death and inaugurated the first govern-
ment to rule all of the Vietnamese-speaking peoples from the Qing border in the
north to the Gulf of Siam in the south.
The thirty years of warfare at the end of the eighteenth century produced the
country of Vietnam as we see it on the map today. What is notable is that
northerners, including the people of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, played hardly
any role at all in these events. By the1770s, the Le–Trinh regime, and northern
society generally, was so worn down by the accumulated effects of flawed efforts
to govern during the course of two centuries that there was no energy to contrib-
ute to the great upsurge of disorder breaking out in the south. The most that
could be accomplished was to occupy Thuan Hoa for a few years while the
southerners battled among themselves. The north had become a place where
dynastic dreams died, whether of the Mac, the Le, the Trinh, or those of Nguyen
Hue and his heir. The miserable effects of war, misgovernment, and hunger had
turned northern villagers inward to the small details of subsistence. Peasants
developed a crust of indifference toward the ambitions of aspiring lords and
kings. Events in Ke Cho did not echo through the countryside. After the Le kings

and Trinh lords were gone, northerners simply waited for the outcome to be
decided elsewhere. During the Thirty Years War, the north went from being the
seat of kings to a provincial backwater.
Thuan Hoa was of symbolic and geographic importance as a place where the
Nguyen Phuc rulers had created a royal court and guarded the south for several
generations. However, once the Nguyen Phuc family had been displaced from
Phu Xuan, Thuan Hoa was disconnected from those who subsequently assumed
power there. Nguyen Hue and his heir used Phu Xuan as an expedient, a place to
stand before taking the next step. The political loyalties of Thuan Hoa people,
for the most part, remained with the Nguyen Phuc family, whose fortunes had
come to depend upon a different region.
The Thirty Years War was basically a contest between two parts of the
southern frontier, Binh Dinh and Gia Dinh. The most desperate fighting took
place in and between these two places. Even after the outcome of the war was no
longer in doubt, the men of Binh Dinh continued to fight to the end. From the
perspective of more than two centuries, why this was the case is not readily
apparent. What was there about Binh Dinh that led so many men to fight so
valiantly for it? The answer to this question lies in the career of Nguyen Nhac,
who was content to rule this place for two decades.
Unlike the other two main figures of this time, Nguyen Hue and Nguyen Phuc
Anh, Nguyen Nhac had no ambition to rule distant places. He represented the
perspective of those frontiersmen who resisted any centralized government over all
Vietnamese speakers, who simply wanted to be left alone to enjoy their small part
of the world. This was a provincial perspective in comparison with the outlook of
men who studied history and had ideas about building a large kingdom. Nguyen
Hue began to pull away from Nguyen Nhac’s view of the word as he came into
contact with the educated men of the north who saw in him a potential founder of
a new dynasty. Nguyen Phuc Anh, for his part, was educated as a high-ranking
member of a royal family that aimed to rule all Vietnamese. Nguyen Nhac did not
care about all of that. The tension between him and Nguyen Hue, and those who
ruled in Phu Xuan after Nguyen Hue’s death, was about his resistance to the pan-
Vietnamese idea. His viewpoint may appear to be stupidly myopic to those who
today assume that all Vietnamese naturally belong in one country. But this was not
an extravagant idea in that time, after generations of separation between north
and south. For many people in Nguyen Nhac’s time, the idea that all Vietnamese
should be joined in one country appeared to be no more inevitable than that they
should be separated into two or three, or even more, separate countries. Nguyen
Nhac and those who picked up his banner in Binh Dinh resisted Nguyen Phuc Anh
because he represented the threat of an organizing and homogenizing unity that
would squeeze away their provincial way of life.

Nguyen Phuc Anh is among the most astute and persistent leaders in Vietnam-
ese history. He was a shrewd judge of character and knew how to use different
kinds of men. He had a vision that enabled him to form successful alliances with
neighboring rulers. He instinctively understood the basics of government and the
importance of paying attention to detail. Yet, without a place like Saigon in
which to exercise his abilities, he is unlikely to have achieved what he did. At
least as important as his qualities of leadership was the dynamic world of Gia
Dinh. Saigon was an international seaport where merchants from many lands
gathered. The cultural diversity of the Mekong plain with Vietnamese, Chinese,
Khmer, Cham, Malay, Siamese, Laotian, European, and upland peoples all
present or coming and going made it a place of encounter and creativity. Naval
power was a critical ingredient of Nguyen Phuc Anh’s success. While the Tay Son
navy was composed of ships seized and sailed by pirates, the shipyards of Saigon
and My Tho produced the most modern navy of any Asian country at that time.
The rise of the south that brought the Thirty Years War to an end was the rise of
Saigon and of the large view of the world that had developed there.

9 THE NGUYEN DYNASTY
Between north and south
The country that appeared at the beginning of the nineteenth century stretching
from the southern border of China to the eastern border of Cambodia had never
existed before. The name Vietnam can be found in some earlier Vietnamese texts,
and the Qing court used this name when recognizing the new country as a vassal
kingdom, but it was not commonly used until the twentieth century. The Qing
continued to routinely refer to this place as An Nam, a name that dated from the
Tang dynasty and that later became the French name for the central part of the
country.
In 1802, Vietnamese envoys to the Qing court were instructed to propose Nam
Viet as the name of their new country. The message sent with the envoys cited the
ancient kingdom of Nam Viet founded by Zhao To in Guangdong and Guangxi
at the beginning of the Han dynasty as an auspicious precedent because it had
pacified and civilized all the southern territories. Furthermore, the message gave
the name a new contemporary meaning as representing the unification of all the
Vietnamese lands:“Now, the South (Nam) has been swept of rebels and the
whole realm of Viet has been restored to normalcy.” The Qing court, however,
objected to the name Nam Viet for the very same reason proposed in its favor by
the Vietnamese. In imperial historiography, contrary to Vietnamese historical
tradition, Zhao To’s kingdom was an inauspicious rather than an auspicious
precedent because it had rebelled against the Han dynasty. Arguments about the
name shuttled between Hue and Beijing for nearly a year before the Qing court
finally turned the name to Viet Nam, thereby avoiding the unpropitious conno-
tation of insubordination and separatism in the name Nam Viet. The name
Vietnam eventually entered popular usage with the spread of alphabetic literacy
and nationalist ideas in the1910s, 1920s, and1930s.
Nguyen Phuc Anh, subsequently remembered by his dynastic name of Gia
Long, established his court at Hue, old Phu Xuan, where his ancestors had ruled

since the seventeenth century. Putting the central government at Hue is under-
standable, considering the ruling family’s long and illustrious association with
this place, and it is even plausible as being more or less equidistant from the two
main centers of population and economy in the plains of the Red and Mekong
Rivers. However, Hue suffered from disadvantages that crippled the efforts of
kings to govern the new country. Hanoi was around650 kilometers to the north
and Saigon was around900 kilometers to the south. For a majority of people in
the country, either Hanoi or Saigon was the administrative and economic center
that governed public life. Experience eventually showed that a ruler had to have a
firm grip on one of these places in order to be able to control the other. Sitting at
Hue, rulers had difficulty controlling either the north or the south.
Hue was previously well situated to guard the northern border of the southern
domain, but that border no longer existed. Furthermore, it was located in a
narrow, relatively isolated, coastal strip without a seaport. Nguyen Phuc Anh’s
military campaigns had shown the importance of shipping and access to the sea
for establishing his new regime, but, after gaining success, he turned away from
the sea and chose to place his court near the tombs of his ancestors. Hue was
masked from the sea behind the shifting sands of dunes and the shallow currents
of lagoons. Da Nang Bay became the main point of access for Hue to the sea, but
it was sixty kilometers south over a major mountain pass. The old seaport of Hoi
An, even further south, was no longer usable because the Thu Bon River had
silted up by the end of the eighteenth century.
The disconnection of Hue from the rest of the country became increasingly
obvious as time went on. The main population centers, in the plains of the Red
and Mekong Rivers, could not be easily governed from this place given the speed
of communication at that time. Historians have faulted the Nguyen dynasty of
the nineteenth century for its rigid and unimaginative response to changing
conditions, but the passivity of leadership at Hue during this time also reflected

country while in the northern and southern plains people were experiencing
dramatic encounters with the forces of a new age. Gia Long’s successor, Minh
Mang, ruling from1820 to 1840, understood the problem and endeavored to
centralize the dynastic system, but his ambition to enforce unity led to rebellion
and confrontation with Siam. His successors, overwhelmed by court politics and
befuddled by unprecedented seaborne threats, stiffened into spectators at the
palace windows.
Gia Long understood that the peoples of his newly conquered realm needed
time to put behind them not only the wars of recent decades but also the sense of
separation that had been enforced for generations at the walls in the Nhat Le
River basin. He ruled with a relatively light touch. He governed as he had learned

to do at Saigon during wartime, with a strict assertion of his authority combined
with pragmatic improvisation and a reluctance to act without careful prepar-
ation and the assurance of success. Furthermore, in the urgent pressures of
wartime he came to understand the strengths and weaknesses of his top-ranking
generals, and he learned to delegate authority to them if not to entirely trust
them. The two most capable of his generals were Nguyen Van Thanh (1757–
1817) and Le Van Duyet. They were in the midst of the hardest fighting during
the last years of the war, often being yoked together in collegial command of
critical campaigns. Yet, they were very different from each other, and they
disliked one another.
Nguyen Van Thanh’s ancestors came from the northern border region of the
old Nguyen domain, in modern Quang Binh Province, but he grew up in Gia
Dinh. His father was a general in the Gia Dinh army who died fighting the Tay
Son in the mid1770s. Nguyen Van Thanh was well educated in both literary and
military studies. He began his career on his father’s staff and, after his father’s
death, entered the circle of Nguyen Phuc Anh’s closest retainers. In1802, Gia
Long made him his viceroy at Hanoi with responsibility for governing the old
Trinh domain. This appointment was ostensibly made because his education and
political cunning made him suitable for dealing with the large number of literati
in the north, many of whom retained lingering loyalties to the Le dynasty. He
was susceptible to pride and ambition.
Le Van Duyet’s ancestors were peasants from Quang Ngai Province. He grew
up in the vicinity of My Tho on the Mekong River. Reportedly born without
genitals, he entered royal service as a eunuch and was with Nguyen Phuc Anh in
1780when he was proclaimed king at Gia Dinh. Like Nguyen Van Thanh, he
followed Nguyen Phuc Anh into Siamese exile and survived many perilous
adventures. Without literary pretensions, he often dressed as a peasant, was
informal, brusque, and even rude, in his manners. His entourage of adopted
sons included Chinese merchants and members of upland minorities. He enjoyed
cockfighting, southern folk theater, and he worshipped local goddesses. After
1802, he became Gia Long’s most trusted man in the far south and eventually
occupied the post of viceroy at Saigon with responsibility for the volatile Khmer
frontier. He was known for being utterly loyal to Gia Long.
According to a famous anecdote, on the eve of battle in1800, Nguyen Van
Thanh offered Le Van Duyet a cup of wine, saying,“Let us drink to give us
strength.” But Le Van Duyet refused, saying,“Only those who are afraid borrow
strength from wine. As for me, I see nothing to be afraid of, so what use have I for
wine?” Embarrassed, Nguyen Van Thanh thereafter nurtured resentment against
Le Van Duyet. Whatever truth may be in this anecdote, the two men came to
represent conflicting tendencies in Gia Long’s entourage. Nguyen Van Thanh

eventually found himself among erudite northerners who were seeking a point of
entry into the Hue court. Le Van Duyet remained among a diverse population of
southerners who were devoted to Gia Long but content to have as little to do
with Hue as possible.
In 1810, Nguyen Van Thanh requested to be replaced as viceroy at Hanoi in
order to mourn the death of his mother. This enabled him to reside at Hue where
he was soon among Gia Long’s closest advisors. Nguyen Van Thanh occasion-
ally submitted confidential messages to Gia Long proposing various measures
that he considered to be propitious. His ideas tended to be astute and timely, and
Gia Long generally followed his advice. With one such message in1812,h e
proposed four courses of action, to all of which Gia Long indicated his assent.
The four priorities addressed by his message were major issues during Gia Long’s
reign: publishing a unified code of law; selecting Confucianists for high office;
pacifying the Cambodian border; and selecting a crown prince to safeguard the
succession.
In 1811, Gia Long had assigned Nguyen Van Thanh to work on sorting out
the codes of law being applied in different parts of the country. In1812, what
came to be called the Gia Long Code was issued. Modern scholars have dilated
about the extent to which this code simply copied provisions from the Qing
dynastic law code, often expressing surprise that Gia Long did not make more
use of the Le Code that had developed at Hanoi since the fifteenth century, which
presumably was more resonant with local practice than the code that had
developed in China. French colonial administrators were particularly critical of
the Gia Long Code, not only because it was so different from their own practice
of law but also because they were inclined to romanticize the Le Code and what
they perceived as indigenous Vietnamese culture as a way of justifying their
efforts to eradicate Chinese influence among the Vietnamese.
Gia Long saw the matter quite differently. For him, the Le Code did not
represent the legal experience of the Vietnamese people. It represented the
practice of Vietnamese in the north. His ancestors had ruled the south for two
centuries without any explicit reference to the Le Code. There is no evidence that
civil law was ever standardized in the south. In fact, there is very little evidence of
concern for standardizing civil law in the south at all. The reason for this is that
southern society developed under the pattern of military authority prevailing at
frontier garrisons. The application of law in the south depended on the vicissi-
tudes of contact with non-Vietnamese peoples, local conditions in places distant
from the central government, and the educational level and personal predilec-
tions of relatively unsupervised officials. Many Vietnamese chose to live in the
south exactly to put distance between themselves and the kind of society adjudi-
cated by the Le Code in the north. Any attempt to enforce the Le Code in the

south, however appropriate it might seem to later scholars, would have been
anachronistic and unacceptable to southerners in Gia Long’s time, for whom the
habits of governance in the north represented the oppressive practice of what for
generations had been their enemy.
At the same time, any legal system designed in the south would have been
unacceptable to northerners. In northern eyes, southerners had turned away
from a properly ordered society and were naturally lawless. Nguyen Van Thanh
and Gia Long resolved the conundrum by importing the Qing Code while adding
and subtracting particular provisions to make it a feasible framework for legal
practice among all Vietnamese. The word“framework” is important, for the Gia
Long Code was never strictly or uniformly applied. Hundreds of edicts were
subsequently published to supplement the code, connecting it to conditions
existing in the country. Legal practice followed a variety of regional adminis-
trative adaptations. The Gia Long Code gave a gloss of unity over a new country
without a common sense of law.
The reason that it was possible to adapt the Qing Code was that legal ideas
and practices among the Chinese and Vietnamese were not excessively dissimilar,
at least in theory and to a large extent even in practice. Furthermore, Gia Long’s
judicial administration was neither adequately staffed with qualified officials nor
sufficiently concerned with a systematic application of law as to be able to strictly
implement the code. This helped to ensure that potential points of dissonance
between provisions in the code and the actual practice of law did not generate
unsolvable problems. Nguyen Van Thanh’s years of administrative experience at
Hanoi among the northern scholars probably turned his mind to the Qing Code
as an admirable solution to the legal morass in the country that would be
acceptable to northerners who valued their membership in the larger East Asian
world and would also be unobjectionable to southerners for whom law was of
little interest.
Nguyen Van Thanh’s idea to appoint more Confucianists to high positions
was designed to appeal to the northern scholars, who made up the bulk of
Confucianists in the country. Gia Long had encouraged the allegiance and
participation in government of educated northerners from the beginning of his
reign, but while this was readily implemented in the viceroyalty at Hanoi, the
central court at Hue remained populated mostly by southerners who had earned
their positions through wartime service. Most of these southerners were experi-
enced soldiers with mediocre educations and little, if any, interest in Confucian-
ism. Le Van Duyet was a prominent example of such a man.
Gia Long understood the tensions between the northern men with their
classical educations and his loyal entourage of pragmatic southerners, but he
was not eager to open opportunities for these tensions to disturb his government.

Consequently, he promoted education and appointed men of trust and talent
wherever he found them, but he did not establish a system of literary exams at the
capital nor did he particularly aim to promote the ambitions of northern
scholars.
In 1807, in response to a proposal from Nguyen Van Thanh, Gia Long opened
regional literary exams at four locations in the Red River plain plus one each in
Thanh Hoa and Nghe An. A total of sixty-two men were selected at these exams.
Those who entered officialdom after excelling in this exam did so in the northern
viceroyalty. Thereafter, Gia Long followed the practice of his ancestors in
holding exams at the regional level every six years. He never instituted a
capital-level exam because“peace had but recently been established and literary
study was still weak.” In 1813, regional exams were expanded to include the
southern provinces. Surviving information about the results of these exams and
about the regional exams of1819 is sketchy and incomplete. However, some
details of the notorious1819 exam at Saigon were recorded. When students were
on the verge of rioting because the questions were too difficult, the examiners
gave them easier questions. Then, there were accusations that one candidate had
concealed the fact that he was in mourning in order to take the exam and that
another candidate had hired a substitute to take the exam for him. Disciplinary
action was taken against both the offending candidates and the examiners.
Gia Long’s relative lack of interest in establishing an examination system is in
contrast to the practice of previous founders of new regimes in the north, such as
Le Loi and Trinh Tung, who held examinations even before achieving success on
the battlefield. It is also in contrast to the Mac, who maintained an examination
schedule amidst the disorders of civil war. The explanation for this is that in the
south a literary education had never been the means for advancing a public
career to the extent that it had become in the north. Aside from the fact that Gia
Long viewed education primarily from a southern perspective as the acquisition
of practical skills, he was not in a hurry to force southerners into academic
contests with northerners, which could only exacerbate regional friction.
Literature
Gia Long’s reign became famous in Vietnamese literary history because of three
poets who have remained popular to the present time. One of them, Nguyen Du
(1765–1820), came from a prominent family from Nghi Xuan district in Nghe
An, near the coast just south of the Ca River. His father, Nguyen Nghiem (1708–
1775), was a laureate of the1731 literary examination and had served the Le–
Trinh regime as both a civil administrator and a military commander. His elder

brother, Nguyen Khan (born in the1740s), a laureate of the1760 examination,
was active in the mid1780s attempting to assist the Le–Trinh regime in putting
down the mutinous soldiers at Ke Cho and in resisting Nguyen Huu Chinh.
Nguyen Du, orphaned at age12, passed the regional examination of1784 at
age 19 and thereafter assisted his brother until they were overwhelmed by the
Tay Son and forced to flee. His brother fled up the Red River into the mountains
where he died. Nguyen Du returned to his home district and avoided serving the
Tay Son, spending his time hunting in the Hong Mountains in the south of Nghi
Xuan district. It was said that his footprints could be found nearly everywhere on
the“ninety-nine” peaks of this region that rise up amidst rice fields near the sea.
He finally returned to public service when he was summoned by Gia Long in
1802and was appointed to a post in a prefecture near Hanoi. He served a short
time before asking for and obtaining sick leave. But his taste for reclusion could
not be enjoyed for long, because his reputation for erudition was too great. In
1806, he was summoned to Hue and appointed to the Secretariat. In1809,h e
was given a post in Quang Binh Province, a short distance north of Hue, which
contained the border walls built in the seventeenth century. According to his
biographer,“he was frequently humiliated by his superiors and consequently
writhed in frustration.” He was nevertheless selected to lead an embassy to the
Qing court in1813 because of his mastery of classical learning.
Nguyen Du’s journey to the imperial capital at Beijing proved to be a large
event in his life, for it inspired him to write two works of poetry that were widely
circulated when he returned. He had a reputation as a good poet and for being
especially good at writing poetry in the vernacular. One of the works he brought
back from his trip to Beijing was a collection of poems in the classical language
entitledTravels in the North, which followed a well-worn tradition of envoys to
the north writing poetry about their experiences and feelings while on the road.
The second work was a novel in the vernacular six-eight mode of poetry. In the
twentieth century, when literary critics began to think about“national litera-
ture,” this work was raised to the status of“the masterpiece of Vietnamese
literature” and is relatively well known today among English-speaking peoples
as The Tale of Kieu(the Vietnamese title isKim Van Kieu).
Despite his literary reputation, and despite his willingness to continue serving
the reigning dynasty, Nguyen Du was not comfortable at the Hue court.
According to his biographer, he was“haughty and conceited, but outwardly
respectful, and was speechless with fear in the king’s presence.” Gia Long was
reported to have chided him for his silent demeanor by reminding him that he
had been treated well and entrusted with important tasks and in return owed his
sovereign the benefit of his thoughts. Perhaps Gia Long identified the problem
when, in the course of his gentle reprimand to Nguyen Du, he observed that the

royal court “employs people on the basis of their talent without any regard to
distinguishing between north and south.” The fact that he mentioned this point is
a good indication that it was a sensitive issue. Nguyen Du, a northerner, may
well have felt that he was intellectually superior to his southern colleagues and
supervisors, and this may have been the source of his taciturnity. He was
nevertheless highly valued by the rulers. He was on the verge of departing on
another mission to the Qing court in1820 when he died. Gia Long’s son and
successor, Minh Mang, honored him at his death, and two of his sons subse-
quently enjoyed successful careers in officialdom.
The Tale of Kieuis a vernacular poetic translation of a Qing prose novel that
Nguyen Du apparently encountered while on his 1813 diplomatic mission.
Inspired by events during the disorders attending the fall of the Ming and the
rise of the Qing in the seventeenth century, the Qing novel is in a romantic genre
of“good boy” meets “good girl”: they fall in love, then great tribulations
separate them until they are reunited in an ostensibly happy ending. Nguyen
Du’s work is a relatively faithful translation of the Qing original, but what
distinguishes it is his superb prosodic artistry, which displays a great knowledge
of classical erudition yet cast into deliciously memorable vernacular poetry.
A century later, the desire of Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese alike to put their
finger on the essence of Vietnamese cultural identity found a plausible target in
The Tale of Kieu, but setting aside the exuberance of modern nationalism, it also
had meaning for the time in which it was written.
The Tale of Kieucame from an orphaned, educated northerner raised among
people loyal to the Le dynasty. Then, after years of rustic retirement to avoid
serving a rebel regime, he decided to serve a new“southern” dynasty. The plot
borrowed from the Qing novel provided ample scope for Nguyen Du to explore
the vicissitudes of idealism and tragedy; good intentions gone awry; comprom-
ises between virtue and profligacy; the breaking of faith and the joy of redemp-
tion; the search for the comfort of human love, of religion, of obedience to those
with a claim on one’s loyalty, and of doing what is right. The comedic reconcili-
ation at the end of the tale, seemingly contrived by appeal to abstract moral
values, is nevertheless an affirmation of family solidarity despite the random
violence of a world twisted with corruption and war. The story is also an answer
to the question about injustice visited upon women found in the eighteenth-
century works by Dang Tran Con (Song of a Soldier’s Wife) and Nguyen Gia
Thieu (Complaint from the Harem). Like these works,The Tale of Kieuis about
how women must suffer for their beauty and talent, but it goes beyond Dang
Tran Con’s simplistic resolution as well as Nguyen Gia Thieu’s unresolved anger.
It is a more nuanced and complicated exposition of the ambiguities and contra-
dictions encountered by people in real-life situations. It reflects the climate of

thought during the reign of Gia Long when, after centuries of separation and
three decades of bitter warfare, a king had managed to enforce peace and the
possibility of some kind of unprecedented unity among Vietnamese speakers.
Nguyen Du persevered amidst the frustrations provoked by his less educated
southern overseers because he believed that a dysfunctional Confucian family
was still better than no family at all.
Another literary figure of this time whose reputation has been burnished by
modern scholars is Ho Xuan Huong, a poetess who skillfully combined erudition
with bawdiness in poems expressing a woman’s critical view of men scrambling
up the ladder of success in a Confucian society. Most of what is written about her
that cannot be gleaned from her poems has arisen from conjecture, for very little
information about her actual life has survived. Pham Dinh Ho (1768–1839),
known for his collections of anecdotes, was apparently acquainted with Ho
Xuan Huong, for he wrote about her poems and that she enjoyed a literary
reputation in Hanoi during the reign of Gia Long. It is generally believed that she
came from a prominent literati family of Quynh Luu district in northern Nghe
An Province. Different theories have been advanced to link her to one or another
branch of this family, either the Ho Phi branch or the Ho Si branch. Both
branches produced respectable scholars in the eighteenth century who served in
missions to the Qing court. One of these, Ho Si Dong (1739–1785), imagined by
some to have been an elder half-brother of Ho Xuan Huong, passed the capital
exam of1772 and ended his career, as did the elder brother of Nguyen Du,
struggling on behalf of the Le–Trinh leaders against mutinous soldiers and the
Tay Son.
By the time of Ho Xuan Huong’s birth, her family was established in Hanoi on
the shore of West Lake. Her father died when she was small and her mother, a
“second wife,” remarried. Despite her lack of parental care, she received a good
education, probably through the attentions of elder siblings or other members of
her extended family. While still young, she was twice married and twice widowed
as a“second wife” to older men who were local magistrates. Thereafter, she
remained single and established a reputation in the literary circles of Hanoi with
her poetry. Her poems reveal an intelligent and strong-minded woman with little
patience for the authority of men. Recently, she has been celebrated as an early
example of a liberated woman in Vietnam. However that may be, her poems
were written from her experience and for people in her time. Judging from Pham
Dinh Ho’s mention of her, she was appreciated in the Hanoi literary world of her
own generation. The cultural scene in Hanoi during Gia Long’s reign is signifi-
cant not only as the context of Ho Xuan Huong’s poetry, but also for revealing
an aspect of social and political history in early nineteenth-century Vietnam that
would have long-term effects.

One feature of Gia Long’s reign was the large population of unemployed
educated northerners who gathered at Hanoi on the fringe of the viceroyal
government. Most of these men received an income from lands owned by their
families. Many of them were waitingfor opportunities to be employed in
officialdom. Many others had no such expectations but simply enjoyed the
lifestyle available in Hanoi. In1807, 1813,a n d1819, when regional exams
were held in the north, the city was crowded with aspiring graduates. As in
times past, there were famous teachers, hundreds of students, and merchants
selling books and writing supplies. But something had changed from earlier
times.
After 1789, for the first time in centuries, there was no king residing in the city.
The country was in the hands of the southerners. The sons of northern literati
families, who for generations had been educated for government service, accu-
mulated in Hanoi with time on their hands and money in their pockets. During
the1790s and1810s, the culture of the Le royal court shifted from the palaces
into the city streets and was transformed in response to the large numbers of
northern scholars who were without access to, if not alienated from, the rulers at
Hue and, consequently, without career prospects.
It was at this time that the style of singing that had developed among the
women of the royal court passed into the tea and wine shops of Hanoi, giving rise
to“tally songs” (ca tru)o r “happy girl songs” (hat a dao). The customers
purchased tokens or “tallies” which they gave to their favorite singers. The
women sang while beating castanet-style with sticks upon a small wooden sound
box, being accompanied by a musician with a long-necked three-stringed lute.
Customers took turns beating a small drum. The ability to beat the drum
correctly and in such a way as to express appreciation for the singer at appropri-
ate parts of the song was a highly prized skill. Books were written to instruct
potential customers in how to beat the drum. In some establishments, a house
critic measured the drummer’s skill by adding pebbles to a basket and the
drummer would have to pay accordingly to ransom the pebbles out of the basket
before departing for the night. Girls with less talent for singing danced to the
music or served drinks to the customers.
Two streets in Hanoi became famous for tally songs. Each street was under the
jurisdiction of a village outside of the city that specialized in managing these
places of entertainment. The youth of these villages were taught from an early
age how to sing, dance, or play the lute. Tally song inns continued to be popular
even during the era of French colonial rule. In the mid1950s the new revolution-
ary government proscribed this form of music on the basis that it manifested the
decadence of the old feudal order, but since the1990s it has been revived as a
distinctive vestige of“national culture.”

Ho Xuan Huong lived in Hanoi during the time that tally songs became
fashionable among educated northern men with the luxury of spending their
time in the city. Her poetry playfully uses double entendre and a woman’s
perspective to satirize male sexual prowess as but a tedious demonstration of
powerlessness in public affairs. Her poems were directed at an audience of men
who could feel the sting of her prosodic skill.
Nguyen Cong Tru (1778–1859) was a poet from this time who eventually
escaped from the realm of uselessness inhabited by many northern literati. He
was from the same district as Nguyen Du, Nghi Xuan in Nghe An. Nothing has
been recorded about his family background, but he did obtain a good educa-
tion, which suggests that he may have come from an obscure family of local
magistrates and teachers or that he may have been a peasant whose intelligence
earned the patronage of a magistrate or teacher. His biographer notes that he
was proud and headstrong from the time of his youth, an observation that may
have been colored by the vicissitudes of his later career as an official in the
1820s, 1830s, and 1840s. During those years, he experienced several turns of
fortune with promotions and demotions resulting from his combination of an
independent spirit with irrefutable talent. A certain strength of mind was
already apparent in1803 when, at the age of25, he presented Gia Long with
a ten-point petition during a royal visit to Nghe An. The contents of his petition
have not been recorded but it was written in response to Gia Long publicly
soliciting the opinions of local people after witnessing the distressing poverty of
the region.
When regional examinations were held for northerners in1807 and 1813,
Nguyen Cong Tru is said to have tried but failed. He finally obtained success in
the examination of1819 and thereafter embarked on what became a colorful
but distinguished career during which he gained fame for reclaiming land on
the coast of the Red River plain as well as for serving on the Cambodian
border. He retired in1848 and lived as a hermit in a Buddhist temple on a
mountain. In 1859, at the age of82, he requested to return to government
service to help against the French invaders, but died shortly after leaving his
mountain retreat.
Nguyen Cong Tru was apparently among the customers of the tally song
establishments in Hanoi during Gia Long’s reign, for he wrote many songs for
women to sing in this style as well as instructions for how to express appreciation
for their singing with the drum. His biographer, writing in1910, noted that the
songs he wrote were still popular. His poetry is full of optimism and the
enjoyment of life amidst troubles and setbacks. He was one northerner who
overcame the disorientation of the royal court being relocated into the south and
found scope for his abilities in service to a new country.

Siam and the question of Khmer vassalage
The third point in Nguyen Van Thanh’s message of1812 had to do with the
situation on the Cambodian border, which had just erupted into a new crisis.
The competition between the Siamese and Vietnamese for control of Cambodia
was in abeyance during the lifetime of Gia Long’s wartime ally, King Chakri,
known posthumously as Rama I. Rama I kept a tight grip on his Khmer vassal
and Gia Long did nothing to contradict this. In1799, Bangkok had called up a
Khmer army and sent it with Siamese and Laotian armies to assist Gia Long
against his Tay Son enemies during the final campaigns of the Vietnamese wars.
But, when the commander of the Khmer army returned with what appeared to
be an excessively friendly attitude toward the Vietnamese, he was exiled to
Bangkok.
The Khmer king Ang Eng had died in1796, and was succeeded by his7-year-
old eldest son, Ang Chan. A Khmer regent governed Cambodia under Siamese
supervision. In1806, the regent died, and Ang Chan, then16 years old, was
crowned in Bangkok before being sent to the Khmer throne in Oudong. The
presence of a crowned king in Cambodia along with increasing slack in the
Siamese presence during Rama I’s declining years opened a possibility for Ang
Chan and the Khmer royal court to claim a larger measure of autonomy.
After Rama I’s death in 1809, the new Siamese king, Rama II, aiming to
exercise his ascendancy in Cambodia, sought to undermine Ang Chan’s position.
He affirmed the finality of the Siamese annexation of the Khmer provinces of
Battambang and Siem Reap in the northwest and looked for ways to extend
Siamese influence into the adjacent provinces of Pursat and Kompong Svay. The
governor of Kompong Svay, a man named Moeung, was close to the Siamese and
had been forced to flee to Bangkok in1808 when he refused to acknowledge Ang
Chan’s authority, an event that reportedly angered Rama II.
In 1810, Rama II sent Moeung back to his post in Kompong Svay, but
Moeung still refused to swear allegiance to Ang Chan. When Ang Chan had
Moeung assassinated, Rama II decided to teach the young Khmer king a lesson
by engineering a rebellion led by Ang Chan’s younger brother, Ang Snguon.
Early in the year1812, Ang Snguon stood up against his elder brother in Pursat,
about 130 kilometers northwest of Oudong, where a Siamese army arrived to
champion his cause. Ang Chan, unwilling to bow to Siamese efforts to weaken
his authority and to deprive him of territory, but lacking the military strength to
challenge Siam, sent envoys to Gia Dinh requesting Vietnamese assistance. The
old story of feuding Khmer princes and Siamese–Vietnamese contention was
about to begin again.

Unable to stand up to the Siamese advance, Ang Chan fled to Gia Dinh at
the beginning of 1813. Gia Long, no longer confined by the scruples of
friendship toward his deceased wartime ally, Rama I, took time to mobilize
a large army and placed it under the command of Le Van Duyet. In late spring
of1813, Le Van Duyet escorted Ang Chan into Cambodia but allowed the
Siamese time to withdraw. The Siamese were unprepared to oppose such a
large Vietnamese force and acquiesced in the Vietnamese restoration of Ang
Chan. Ang Snguon took refuge in Bangkok. Le Van Duyet built strong
defenses for Phnom Penh, where he installed Ang Chan with a Vietnamese
garrison, then withdrew his army back into Vietnam. Rama II had overplayed
his hand in Cambodia and provoked intoreality a situation that he had been
determined to avoid. Gia Long was characteristically decisive and planned
carefully for success.
Gia Long enforced his authority as Ang Chan’s suzerain with the principle
of maintaining boundaries between peoples. When Siamese envoys arrived
by sea at Hue in1815 and requested permission to return to Bangkok via
Cambodia to pay their respects to the Khmer king, Gia Long refused, deter-
mined to offer no opportunity for Siamese intrigue to germinate. Later in the
year, when he learned that large numbers of Vietnamese fugitives and adven-
turers were going to Cambodia and causing trouble, he instructed Ang
Chan to expel all Vietnamese back intoVietnam except for soldiers assigned
to garrison duty and merchants with passports. At the end of the year, when
he learned that a Khmer officer had provoked a border incident with the
Siamese, Gia Long instructed Ang Chan to punish him. In1818, Gia Long
ordered officials to encourage Cham s, Chinese, and Khmers to settle on
uninhabited land in the Mekong plain and to prevent Vietnamese from
bothering them.
Gia Long’s policy toward Cambodia was to minimize interference in Khmer
affairs and to encourage a sense of well being among the Khmer people while
maintaining the upper hand in regard to Siam. In late1818, in response to Khmer
complaints about the Vietnamese official serving as“protector” at Phnom Penh,
Gia Long replaced the man, saying,“The government must be in harmony with
the feelings of the people. If the [Khmer] people do not want something, it cannot
be forced on them. If something is forced on them, we will provoke hatred on the
border.” Such high-sounding sentiments did not always translate from the court
at Hue to Vietnamese administrators in the Mekong plain, but they had been
typical of Gia Long’s attitude toward governing the diverse populations of the
south and of government in general since the1780s. He never showed interest in
changing the way people lived so long as they were obedient to him and did not
harm others.

Dynastic discipline
The fourth issue raised by Nguyen Van Thanh in1812 proved to be his undoing.
This was the succession question. Gia Long’s three eldest sons were already dead.
The choice of crown prince was between My Duong, the eldest son of former
Crown Prince Canh, who was in his teens and was Gia Long’s eldest grandson,
and Gia Long’s fourth son, Minh Mang (1791–1840), already in his twenties.
Gia Long was inclined toward Minh Mang because of his maturity and the fact
that he was not likely to be manipulated by others. He considered that those who
favored My Duong were looking for an opportunity to influence a youthful king.
Nguyen Van Thanh, for reasons that can only be conjectured, decided to pose
publicly as an advocate for My Duong. Apparently, he was led astray by his past
experience in submitting proposals to Gia Long and having them approved, as
well as by his well-known fondness for wine.
In 1815, Nguyen Van Thanh announced to a group of officials whom he had
invited to his house for drinks that“The kid will be named crown prince; I am
about to petition the king about it.” Informants reported the remark to Gia
Long. Shortly after, an official reported to Le Van Duyet that Nguyen Van
Thanh’s son was making conspiratorial moves to ensure that My Duong would
follow his grandfather on the throne. Le Van Duyet immediately alerted Gia
Long. In1816, Nguyen Van Thanh was arrested. Shortly after, a conspiracy to
rally a rebellion around Le Duy Hoan, the senior member of the formerly royal
Le family, was uncovered, and Nguyen Van Thanh and his son were implicated
as having previously given encouragement to the conspirators. In1817, Nguyen
Van Thanh drank poison and his son was executed. Thus ended the old feud
between Nguyen Van Thanh and Le Van Duyet.
The supposed conspiracies of Nguyen Van Thanh and his son to engineer the
appointment of My Duong as crown prince and to champion the restoration of
the Le dynasty may have been more smoke than fire, but even smoke is a sign of
something. Behind Nguyen Van Thanh’s support of My Duong and the suspi-
cions of his pro-Le sympathies lay his susceptibility to the sensitivities of north-
erners and his efforts to soften southern attitudes toward northerners at the Hue
court. This was demonstrated in1811 when he argued on behalf of Dang Tran
Thuong.
Dang Tran Thuong (d.1816) was from the Hanoi area. His family had held
prestigious positions under the Le dynasty. He was well educated and ambitious.
Unwilling to serve the Tay Son, in1794 he fled by sea to Saigon and joined
Nguyen Phuc Anh, who quickly learned to appreciate his skill as an adminis-
trator and as a leader of soldiers. He was in the forefront of many battles during

the final years of the war and was assigned to serve with Nguyen Van Thanh at
Hanoi when the war ended. In1805, he recommended fourteen northern
scholars for service at the Hue court. In1809 he was summoned from Hanoi
to Hue to take charge of the Ministry of War. During his service at Hanoi, a
group of officials had been charged with compiling biographical information
about prominent deceased northerners in order to prepare a register of those
worthy of being posthumously honored by the Hue court. When indications of
widespread fraud began to surface, motivated by northerners seeking to revise
family records to burnish their credentials with the new dynasty, a full investi-
gation was set in motion.
Among the facts that came to light was that Dang Tran Thuong had revised
information about Hoang Ngu Phuc, the Trinh general who had invaded the
south and expelled the Nguyen Phuc from Hue in 1774–1775. Dang Tran
Thuong erased the posthumous titles granted to Hoang Ngu Phuc by the
Trinh and added Hoang Ngu Phuc’s name to the register being compiled for
honors at the Hue court. A long and contentious argument broke out between
those affirming that Dang Tran Thuong deserved death and those favoring
clemency on account of previous merit. Nguyen Van Thanh, who had worked
with Dang Tran Thuong in Hanoi for several years, was at the head of those
speaking for clemency. Gia Long finally decided that, considering how Hoang
Ngu Phuc’s southern campaign had affected not only his family but him
personally, any effort to rehabilitate the man’s name was unacceptable and
deserved death. Nguyen Van Thanh was fined for arguing on Dang Tran
Thuong’sb e h a l f .
Dang Tran Thuong was imprisoned, but in1813 Gia Long lifted his death
sentence and released him, yet he was not allowed to leave Hue. In1816, after
the arrest of Nguyen Van Thanh, new charges of corruption were brought
against Dang Tran Thuong dating from the time he had served in Hanoi. This
prompted him to deliver a drunken rant against Gia Long, after which he was
seized and hung. The angry words that earned him the belated execution of his
death sentence were not recorded. They escaped from the disappointed ambitions
of a talented man and the whispering world of suppressed northern resentment
toward a regime of southerners. That it ever entered Dang Tran Thuong’s mind
to rehabilitate the memory of Hoang Ngu Phuc at Gia Long’s court is a remark-
able indication of the blind intensity of northern feelings.
Gia Long dealt with court politics in a manner similar to that in which he had
conducted his armies during the war. He was not hasty, yet he was decisive. He
strictly enforced norms of obedience and trusted his enemies to eventually bring
about their own downfall. Predictably, the most serious intrigues that he faced
were related to tensions between northerners and southerners, particularly to

efforts by northerners to reshape the central government toward their regional
interests and the vigilance of southerners to prevent this.
Relations with the Khmer vassal
One of Gia Long’s final decisions would have a long-term effect on Khmer–Viet
relations. In1819, Gia Long decided to dig what became the Vinh Te and Vinh An
Canals. Gia Long’s stated intention was to benefit Cambodia by creating a more
convenient water route from the Khmer capital to the sea and to benefit Vietnam
by completing an inland water route connecting all administrative centers in the
Mekong plain. The Vinh Te Canal would link Ha Tien, on the Gulf of Siam, with
Chau Doc, on the southern branch of the Mekong River. The Vinh An Canal
extended the Vinh Te Canal to the northern branch of the Mekong River with
access to Vinh Long, My Tho, Saigon, and Bien Hoa. Plans for the canals were
prepared in consultation with Ang Chan, and workers from both countries were
mobilized for the task, reportedly five thousand Khmers and five thousand Viet-
namese, along with five hundred Vietnamese soldiers. The Khmer and Vietnamese
workers were organized and supervised by officials of their own countries. Gia
Long ordered that every worker, both Khmer and Vietnamese, was to receive a
monthly allotment of rice and a cash salary. He acknowledged that it would be
hard labor but that the benefit for future generations would be great. Gia Long
completed arrangements for work on the canals in late1819, shortly before his
death, and construction began after the new year holiday.
By late spring1820, with the work about one-third completed, reports that the
workers were suffering from the effects of hard labor prompted Minh Mang, the
new king at Hue, to issue an appeal to the Khmer king and his officials encour-
aging them to persevere in the common task. At the same time he gave orders to
distribute medicine to sick workers and to issue money and cloth to the families
of workers who died on the job. He also ordered that the scale of the remaining
work be temporarily reduced to allow passage for small boats only. That
summer, when the monsoon rains arrived, an epidemic spread among the
workers and into the neighboring population. The Hue court sent instructions
for prayers to be made, medicine to be distributed, and burial costs to be paid at
public expense. According to a Khmer source, bad working conditions were
exacerbated for the Khmer by the arrogant and unsympathetic attitude of
Vietnamese officials, producing dissention among the Khmer officials in charge
of the workforce; this led many Khmer laborers to abandon the project and to
return to their villages. In fact, soon after the coming of the summer rains, the
project was suspended and all workers were sent back to their homes.

The digging of these canals had commenced as the Hue court was distracted by
the death of one king and the accession of another. Local Vietnamese officials
nevertheless already had prior experience mobilizing thousands of workers for
canal work and organizing logistics for food, housing, and equipment. For
example, in early1819, around twenty thousand people had been mobilized
for canal work in the Saigon and My Tho areas. Cambodian officials had no
comparable prior experience and expected the Vietnamese to take responsibility
for problems. The canals were eventually completed during the springtime dry
seasons of1823 and 1824 with a workforce of around fifty thousand men in
1823 and twenty-five thousand in1824, two-thirds of which in both years was
comprised of Vietnamese militiamen with Khmer laborers constituting the rest.
Today, the Vinh Te Canal marks the border between Cambodia and Vietnam.
In autumn of1820, a Khmer Buddhist monk named Ke, in the region of Ba
Phnom east of the Mekong River, initiated a rebellion against King Ang Chan. Ba
Phnom is in the center of a triangle formed by Phnom Penh, Chau Doc, and Tay
Ninh, being about seventy kilometers from each of these places. Cambodian
historians have commonly assumed that this uprising was an anti-Vietnamese
revolt provoked by conditions at the canal worksite. Ba Phnom is rather far away
and across the Mekong River from the worksite. Khmer workers were mostly
mobilized from the modern provinces of Kampot and Takeo, directly adjacent to
the worksite south of the Mekong River, judging from French reports of mem-
ories among peasants in those areas later in the century. Consequently, Khmer
workers returning to their villages were unlikely to have gone anywhere near Ba
Phnom. With Ang Chan’s attention focused on the worksite, however, it was an
opportune time for Ke to initiate his uprising.
Ke appears to have been motivated by Ang Chan’s reliance upon Chams at
least as much as he was by his hatred of Vietnamese. Ke was unhappy about Ang
Chan showing favor to a Muslim Cham leader named Tuan Pha, who had
become one of Ang Chan’s trusted subordinates. Muslim Cham communities
had been established in areas near Ba Phnom for several generations and friction
between them and the Buddhist Khmers was in the background of Ke’s uprising.
Instead of leading his followers across the Mekong River to the canal worksite
where he could presumably have mobilized disaffected Khmer workers, Ke
advanced in the opposite direction and ravaged the region of Tay Ninh, far from
the canal, which was inhabited by Chams and Vietnamese.
The Vietnamese garrison at Gia Dinh was unsuccessful against Ke, but Le Van
Duyet soon arrived with soldiers from the north and pushed the rebel army back
into Cambodia. Ke then led his followers to attack Phnom Penh. Ang Chan sent
Tuan Pha against the rebels, but several Khmer generals defected to Ke and Tuan
Pha was repulsed. Within a matter of weeks, Le Van Duyet led a Vietnamese

army up the Mekong and joined with Ang Chan’s army, comprised mainly of
Chams and Chinese, to utterly defeat the uprising, killing Ke in battle. By the end
of the year, Le Van Duyet took his army back to Vietnam, leaving a700-man
garrison at Phnom Penh. Ang Chan had become a docile Vietnamese vassal. So
long as Le Van Duyet lived, the Siamese made no attempt to challenge this state
of affairs. After the Cambodian campaign of1820, Le Van Duyet served as the
viceroy at Saigon until his death, twelve years later.
During Gia Long’s reign, Le Van Duyet had specialized in crises requiring
military responses. Aside from Cambodia, two other areas had occupied much of
his attention. Depredations of the“stone wall” people in Quang Ngai, which had
absorbed Nguyen Cu Trinh’s attention in the1750s, became chronic after the
wars. Le Van Duyet carried out major operations in Quang Ngai Province four
times between1803 and 1815. He finally arranged a defensive system of walls
and garrisons facing the mountains that extended from Quang Nam Province
through Quang Ngai to Binh Dinh Province.
Le Van Duyet spent several months during1819 in Nghe An and Thanh Hoa,
where reports of banditry and insubordination had accumulated. He reported
that misgovernment by incompetent, corrupt, and oppressive local officials had
led to peasants fleeing from their villages and soldiers rising in mutiny. After
consulting with Gia Long, he appointed new officials, forgave unpaid taxes,
reduced corvée obligations, and thereby restored order. Some places required
military action against bandits and small armies of disaffected fugitives. As much
as possible, Le Van Duyet made use of local military leadership. He was also
willing to incorporate surrendered rebels into his military units. His method of
pacification was based on winning the cooperation of local people and appears
to have been mostly successful. After this assignment, Le Van Duyet oversaw the
accession of Gia Long’s successor at Hue before traveling south to deal with the
Cambodian uprising.
Minh Mang’s centralizing policies
Gia Long’s confidence in his fourth son as a man with his own mind was well
placed. Minh Mang was an intelligent and active ruler with definite ideas about
how to govern. Unlike his successors, historians have never viewed him as being
manipulated by others. On the other hand, My Duong, the royal grandson who
had been championed by Nguyen Van Thanh in1815, was turned into an
embarrassment, whether justly or through trickery is unknown. In1824,h e
and his mother were charged with incest. His mother was put to death, and he
was banished from the royal family.

Minh Mang was a child during the final years of his father’s wars, came of age
as Hue was being built into a royal capital, and became king at age30. He had
received an excellent education with the most erudite of teachers. He was a
relatively disciplined man with a lively interest in government and a strong sense
of responsibility for ruling his country. On the other hand, he lacked the practical
experience of his father. He also lacked his father’s toleration of administrative
heterogeneity and cultural diversity. Gia Long had the benefit of subordinates
with whose strengths and weaknesses he was familiar through years of military
campaigns. He had created his government from his wartime entourage and for
the most part it operated as an extension of his personality. Minh Mang entered
an existing structure of authority and eventually came to see some of the men
who had served his father as obstacles to his more strictly bureaucratic style of
rule. Minh Mang was a strong and decisive leader. But he was also ethno-
culturally intolerant, which limited his capacity to devise successful policies in
the Mekong plain.
Historians have tended to see Minh Mang as a centralizer because he elimin-
ated the northern and southern viceroyalties and tried to organize a single
administrative system for the whole country. His policies revealed a desire for
uniformity in government, in religion, in culture, and even in apparel. For
example, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, silk was relatively
more available for common use in the south than in the north, and silk trousers
became everyday wear for both men and women. In the north, however, cotton
skirts similar to the Burmeselongyi were widely worn, especially by women.
Minh Mang promoted a policy of encouraging northerners to adopt what
southerners, in an1828 court discussion, considered to be more“proper” attire.
However, he instructed officials to enforce the new dress code slowly and
cautioned them against expecting to change“in a day” the manner of dress that
had been customary in the north for“six or seven hundred years.”
One of Minh Mang’s first concerns was to establish a source of new men who
had not served his father, men who could be shaped by his own style of
authority. As Vietnamese rulers had done for generations, he turned to the
literary examination system. He instituted the capital examination in1822,
which conferred the doctoral degree (tien si) for the first time since the last
capital examination held under the Le dynasty in1787, thirty-five years before.
When this did not produce many graduates, in1829 he began to award a second-
rank degree, which can be called a junior doctor (pho bang), to make men with
good, if not excellent, educational achievement available for administrative
appointments. Whether by design or not, thirty-five of the thirty-six men who
received the doctoral degree in the first four examinations (1822, 1826, 1829,
and 1832) were from the north, that is from Nghe An and jurisdictions to the

north. Six of the eight junior doctors in the years1829 and 1832 were also from
the north. In the two remaining examinations during Minh Mang’s reign,1835
and 1838, thirteen of twenty-one doctors and six of twelve junior doctors were
from the north.
Overall, in the six examinations during Minh Mang’s reign, forty-eight of
fifty-seven doctors and twelve of twenty junior doctors were from the north. For
the first four examinations, the proportion of examination graduates from the
north was overwhelming. More graduates began to appear from the south near
the end of Minh Mang’s reign. To some extent these results can be attributed to
the relatively more developed tradition of study and scholarship in the north, but
they also show that Minh Mang was prepared to open government service to
educated northerners.
Nevertheless, the number of graduates is not impressive when compared with
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. To fill administrative positions, many
graduates of regional examinations were taken directly into government service,
and non-literary roads to appointment remained alive, particularly in the south.
During Minh Mang’s reign, over seven hundred men graduated from regional
examinations, but only around10 percent of these came from the south. The
potential of the educational and examination systems to unify the country with a
large cadre of officials shaped by a common curriculum and a common career
path was not realized to any significant degree. The reason for this was that
regional differences continued to present serious obstacles to a unifying educa-
tional system. Education meant different things to northerners and southerners.
Beginning in the1830s, capital examination graduates started to appear from the
Hue region, comprised of the modern provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri,
Thua Thien, and, to a lesser extent, Quang Nam. But graduates from further
south were extremely rare. During Minh Mang’s, Thieu Tri’s, and Tu Duc’s
reigns, only two doctors and five junior doctors came from Quang Ngai, four
doctors and two junior doctors came from Binh Dinh, and three doctors and one
junior doctor came from Gia Dinh in the Mekong plain. There were no graduates
from Phu Yen, Khanh Hoa, or Binh Thuan.
After the examination of1856, the French navy occupied Gia Dinh, but even
before that there is no evidence of success in incorporating the provinces south of
the Hue region into the examination system. Aside from people in provinces close
to the royal court, southerners showed little interest in the kind of literary
education required to enter the examinations. In the south, relatively abundant
land, a market culture of entrepreneurship, and a tradition of military service
provided appealing alternatives to years of study.
Minh Mang did not initiate any significant reform of the agrarian regime or
the tax system. Rather, he adjusted policies in various localities in response to

changing conditions, aiming at a general appearance of uniformity. An almost
continual rustling of unrest and popular disaffection drew attention to the
ongoing task of pacification and emphasized the difficulty of governing distant
places from Hue. Minh Mang responded with major administrative initiatives,
by which he endeavored to establish a system of authority throughout the
country that was directly responsive to him. There may have been no reason
why eventually such a government based at Hue could not have been effective.
But, given the legacies of regional separatisms and the distance of Hue from
major population centers, more time would have been needed to achieve this
than was available to Gia Long’s heirs.
In 1831, Minh Mang abolished the viceroyalty at Hanoi and reorganized
northern provinces to be more directly under the authority of the Hue royal
court. In announcing this change, he cited fifteen reasons, all of which indicated
the greater efficiency to be obtained by removing a level of government between
the royal court and provincial officials. Five of the fifteen points had to do with
expectations of more effective military responses to unrest, banditry, and rebel-
lion in local jurisdictions. Nine of the points referred to inefficiencies and
irregularities, waste of time and manpower, and lack of transparency between
the court and the provinces that were characteristic of the viceroyalty. One point
aimed at liberating local feeling from the big mix of a regional jurisdiction.
Demonstrating this point at a sub-provincial level, the lowland districts south
of the Ca River in Nghe An were at this time separated to form Ha Tinh
Province. A number of other adjustments to provincial boundaries in the north
were implemented.
The end of the Hanoi viceroyalty did not mean the end of administrative posts
between Hue and the provinces. The viceroyalty was replaced with a structure of
jurisdictions that were mostly comprised of two neighboring provinces, which
provided a more direct link between local government and the royal court. At the
same time, a separate system of military commands under the Ministry of War
was organized at the sub-provincial level, which gave Hue an administrative path
to localities that bypassed provincial government. The reforms implemented at
this time extended to all jurisdictions north of Hue, including Quang Tri and
Quang Binh. They came after several years during which the role of the Hanoi
viceroyalty had been gradually diminished, and they were achieved without
difficulty. Minh Mang’s effort to implement similar reforms in the south, how-
ever, was not as uneventful.
During the 1820s, Le Van Duyet, the viceroy at Saigon, presided over the
Mekong plain, including the Khmer protectorate, as if it were his private domain.
He had no discernible disloyal design, but his style of governance, although
harmonious with local conditions, was at odds with Minh Mang’s unifying aims.

Le Van Duyet followed Gia Long’s policy of keeping the various ethnic, religious,
and social groups in the south separate from each other and allowing each group
to follow its own way of life so long as it did not threaten public order. These
groups were Khmers, Chams, Chinese, and upland minorities, but also different
kinds of Vietnamese, such as Christians, former rebels, and prisoners from
northern jurisdictions suffering banishment. Le Van Duyet cultivated the trust
and loyalty of all these groups. He protected a French missionary who entered
the country illegally, he encouraged exiled criminals to integrate into normal
society, he shielded Khmer and Cham communities from encroaching Vietnam-
ese, he allowed Chinese and Vietnamese businessmen to prosper, he supervised
the Khmer king and watched the Siamese border with discreet vigilance. But, by
the late1820s, he was in his mid sixties and beginning to tire. His popularity
among the people in the far south persuaded Minh Mang to keep him at his post
while meanwhile reducing his authority by replacing his men with officials sent
from Hue.
In 1828, one of Le Van Duyet’s senior administrators was reassigned to the
north, where he was promptly accused of corruption and imprisoned. He was
replaced by one of Minh Mang’s trusted officers. The inability of Le Van Duyet
to control the appointments in his jurisdiction and to protect his men, as he had
been able to do in previous years, indicated the beginning of a shift in the
relationship between him and the king. The Vietnamese protector at the Khmer
royal court was a man recommended by Le Van Duyet. When the protector died
in1829, however, Minh Mang ignored Le Van Duyet’s recommendation and
instead appointed two of his officials from Hue to supervise the Cambodian
protectorate. In1831, Minh Mang replaced the military commander at Saigon,
and Le Van Duyet’s army units were reassigned to places further north. By the
time of Le Van Duyet’s death in1832, officials sent from Hue, unfamiliar with
and intolerant of local conditions, were provoking widespread disaffection and
agitation among the various populations in the Mekong plain.
Immediately upon Le Van Duyet’s death, the southern viceroyalty was abol-
ished and replaced with an administrative scheme similar to what had been
implemented in the north the previous year. The“Six Provinces” (Luc Tinh) of
the Mekong plain (Bien Hoa; Gia Dinh/Saigon; Dinh Tuong/My Tho; Vinh
Long; An Giang/Chau Doc; and Ha Tien) were reorganized and paired with
supervising officials assigned to two provinces. If he had left it at that, Minh
Mang may have had as peaceful a transition to his centralization policy as there
had been in the north. But Minh Mang took the opportunity to unleash pent-up
frustrations with what he perceived as problems that had been enabled by Le Van
Duyet’s regime in the far south. Without delay he moved decisively to privilege
Vietnamese over other ethnic groups, to prohibit Christianity, to harden the

penal regime on banished criminals, to increase surveillance of Chinese business
activities, and to posthumously proclaim Le Van Duyet to have been a traitor.
Even this may not have provoked more than minor disorders if Le Van Duyet’s
regime had not been a critical factor in providing an escape valve for internal
unrest and in keeping the peace with Siam. Minh Mang’s high-handed move into
the south was accompanied by major domestic rebellions and war with Siam.
When applied to the far south, Minh Mang’s passion for uniformity led him into
confrontations that brought an end to Gia Long’s era of tolerating differences.
Minh Mang established strict, even harsh, policies toward local officials, toward
Christians, and toward Cambodians that his weak successors were unable to
change except under duress. His reign was followed by an era of spreading
disorder that left men at the Hue court as spectators to the collapse of dynastic
authority. By suppressing the south, Minh Mang attacked its awareness of the
outside world that could have been an asset when the European threat material-
ized shortly after his death. Instead, his policies provoked internal discord and
created opportunities for foreign powers.
Background to Le Van Khoi’s rebellion
When Le Van Duyet pacified Nghe An and Thanh Hoa in1819, he acquired
armies of surrendered rebels and bandits who swore loyalty to him and to the
king at Hue. When he went south in1820 to deal with the Cambodian uprising
and to thereafter be viceroy at Saigon, these armies went with him. One of the
men he acquired in Thanh Hoa was a charismatic and capable officer named Be
Van Khoi (d.1834) who was originally from the northern mountain province of
Cao Bang. In1787, when he was a child, his father, a local leader in Cao Bang,
had been killed in fighting between feuding officials taking opposite sides in the
breakdown of Trinh rule. Be Van Khoi apparently had a mixed career first as a
bandit chief and then as a military officer under the Hanoi viceroy. He eventually
established himself in Thanh Hoa, where he took the name Nguyen Huu Khoi. In
1819, Le Van Duyet adopted him into his entourage, and he changed his name to
Le Van Khoi. Le Van Khoi became a trusted subordinate of Le Van Duyet in the
Saigon viceroyalty during the1820s.
The pardoned insurgents from Nghe An and Thanh Hoa were organized into
peasant militias in the Mekong plain. There was also a population of banished
criminals from the north that had been accumulating since the beginning of Gia
Long’s reign. Many of them brought their families with them into exile and were
assigned to open up new agricultural land. In1824, Le Van Duyet remitted their
sentences and accorded them a status similar to the pardoned insurgents from

Nghe An and Thanh Hoa. Nguyen Van Cham, previously banished from a
district near Hanoi, became a leader of militia units composed of these men.
Furthermore, a military unit was made up of men from the Red River plain who
had failed to register for military conscription and who accepted a term of service
in the south to restore their legal status. Because of the ongoing unrest and
failures of government in the north, the population of men serving terms of exile
in the far south was continually replenished by new arrivals. Many such men
sought to build new lives by joining one of these militia organizations. Le Van
Duyet gave lawless and unlucky men from the north a second chance.
In 1832, after Le Van Duyet’s death, Minh Mang revoked Le Van Duyet’s
policy of clemency toward banished northerners and returned them to the status
of criminals. They were uprooted and sent to remote places on the Cambodian
border. This provoked resistance and antagonism among all the northerners who
had found opportunities for new lives under Le Van Duyet. The groups of militia
made up of former northern lawbreakers were in the forefront of the rebellion
that broke out in May of1833, led by Le Van Khoi.
The Chinese were another target of Minh Mang’s frustration with Le Van
Duyet’s regime. Minh Mang believed that Chinese merchants were illegally
exporting rice from Saigon, which drove up the price of rice in the country.
There is evidence that Vietnamese merchants were involved in the contraband
rice trade as well as the Chinese, but Minh Mang placed the onus of this problem
upon the Chinese. That Chinese maintained close relationships with their Chi-
nese homeland and with Chinese communities elsewhere in Southeast Asia
stimulated Minh Mang’s doubts about their loyalty and trustworthiness. Minh
Mang was keen to bring the Chinese population and its considerable wealth
under the control of Hue. The unsympathetic, even harsh, attitude of newly
appointed Hue officials toward the Chinese ensured that, when rebellion came
in1833, the Chinese were active participants. Luu Tin was a prominent leader in
the rebellion. A Chinese merchant born in Hoi An, he had traveled in China, was
a prominent leader of the Chinese in Saigon, and, like Le Van Khoi, had become
an adopted son of Le Van Duyet.
Christians were also active in this rebellion. Christians had been a relatively
large part of the Vietnamese population in the Mekong plain from the seven-
teenth century. Le Van Duyet’s protection of Christians was at odds with Minh
Mang’s great antipathy toward them. Minh Mang believed that Christians
subverted public morality, engaged in despicable practices, and invited European
aggression. His attitude toward Christianity was formed first of all by his disgust
with the lack of respect that Christians expressed for“Buddha and ancestors,”
two objects of veneration upon which the authority of his dynasty had been built,
and by his reading of stories from the Christian Bible, which he considered

irrational and ridiculous. He lived in a time when virulently anti-Christian
propaganda was being circulated among Vietnamese officials. He both encour-
aged and was influenced by writings that described the mixing of men and
women in churches during worship and practices that led to public fornication
and the seduction of women and girls. He was upset about rumors that Chris-
tians used human eyeballs to make medicine. But what most worried him were
writings that claimed to prove how the Christian religion was a means for
Europeans to take over foreign countries. He praised the Tokugawa policy of
exterminating Christianity in Japan.
Despite his view of Christianity, Minh Mang respected the merit of the three
Frenchmen who had served in the entourage of his father and who remained in
Vietnam as dynastic servants in the early years of his reign. Jean Marie Despiau
had worked in the medical service since1795, and Minh Mang sent him to
Macau to obtain smallpox vaccine to inoculate members of the royal family. Jean
Baptiste Chaigneau and Philippe Vannier had married Vietnamese women,
established families at Hue, and held positions at the royal court. Chaigneau
returned from a visit to France in1820 with an appointment as diplomatic
representative from the French court to Hue, which greatly complicated his
position in Minh Mang’s service.
In late1824, shortly after Despiau’s death, Chaigneau and Vannier departed
Hue and returned to France for good. They left Hue just months after the
British had seized Rangoon during the so-called First Anglo-Burmese War, an
event that particularly aroused Minh Mang’s perception of Europeans as
aggressive and dangerous. The British founding of Singapore in 1819 had
caught Minh Mang’s frowning attention; then efforts by the Burmese king
Bogyidaw (r. 1819–1837) to enforce his authority over vassals on the borders
of British India elicited an invasion that led to British annexation of Arakan and
Tenasserim, creating a common Anglo-Siamese border. Minh Mang’s reaction
to events in Burma was a decisive turning away from contact with Europeans
and a determination to eradicate the European religion. In1825, Minh Mang
prohibited European missionaries from entering the country. At the beginning
of1833, he published an edict against Christianity, calling on officials to
destroy churches, to arrest Christian leaders, to send European missionaries to
Hue, and to persuade Christians to abandon their religion. Four months later,
the southern rebellion began.
The rebellion was also related to Siamese policy. Gia Long had ruled during a
time when Europeans were occupied with the Napoleonic Wars and Siam was
confronted with a rampant Burma. During Minh Mang’s reign, Siam was freed
from the Burmese threat by the rise of British India and, obtaining a treaty of
non-aggression with the British, King Rama III (r.1824–1851) reoriented his

armies to embark on more active policies along his eastern borders. Minh
Mang’s first encounter with these policies was in Laos during the late1820s.
At that time, three Lao realms professing allegiance to Siam existed along the
Mekong River. The most important was Lan Sang, ruled from Vientiane, which
extended along both banks of the middle Mekong and included most of what is
now northeast Thailand. Champassak in the south on the Cambodian border
and Luang Prabang in the northern mountains were of lesser importance. The
ruler of Lan Sang, Chao Anou (1767–1829), rebelled against Rama III in1827
after a series of personal humiliations and Siamese violations of existing proto-
cols. The final provocation was a Siamese campaign to brand the Lao people
west of the Mekong River, thereby claiming them as Siamese subjects with no
obligations to Chao Anou.
Defeated in battle, Chao Anou fled to the Nghe An border and begged for
refuge from Minh Mang. Minh Mang gave him temporary shelter while
insisting that he would have to return to his Siamese suzerain. In1828 a
small Vietnamese force escorted him back to Vientiane. He was subsequently
captured by the Siamese and died in captivity. Minh Mang was determined to
avoid getting involved with the Siamese over Laotian affairs in the Mekong
plain. However, when the ruler of Xieng Khouang (Siang Khuang) on the
plateau upriver from Nghe An, threatened by enemies allied with the Siamese,
came and submitted to him, Minh Mang readily sent soldiers to assert Viet-
namese sovereignty in the mountains. The Siamese acquiesced to this, being
occupied with relocating the lowland Lao population from the left to the right
bank of the Mekong River. Taking their cue from Xieng Khouang, the various
mountain lords further south also submitted to Hue. Amidst these events,
Siamese troops threatened Vietnamese outposts on the Cam Lo Road that
extended from Quang Tri across the mountains to the Mekong and a Siamese
officer murdered three Vietnamese envoys in southern Laos, which gave rise to
strong anti-Siamese sentiments among Vietnamese officials and soured diplo-
matic exchanges between Bangkok and Hue. Minh Mang nevertheless bene-
fited from the Siamese suppression oflowland Lao by gaining ascendancy in
the adjacent mountains with a minimum of effort and without provoking war
with Siam.
The effect of Minh Mang’s changes in governance and in administrative
personnel in the south after the death of Le Van Duyet gave rise to great unease
among the various marginal peoples there, not only northern exiles, Christians,
and Chinese, but also Chams, Khmers, and other ethnic minorities. In1832,a t
the same time that the Saigon viceroyalty was abolished, Minh Mang dissolved
the Cham tributary kingdom in Binh Thanh, just to the north of the Mekong
plain. Minh Mang’s men in Cambodia soon alienated the Khmers with their

ignorance of and lack of respect for local custom, and the Siamese were quick to
take note.
As if he wanted to make sure to alienate every possible group in the region,
Minh Mang aimed a direct attack upon the old established Vietnamese popula-
tion of Gia Dinh by opening investigations into Le Van Duyet’s rule and posthu-
mously charging him with corruption and sedition. This official smearing of Le
Van Duyet’s memory was too much for local Vietnamese. It clearly showed that
Minh Mang was determined, by any means, to break the spirits of the
southerners.
Minh Mang’s haste to seize the upper hand in the far south was in some
measure motivated by his perception that Rama III had designs on the Cambo-
dian protectorate. That he chose to employ the certainty of hard measures rather
than chancing the possibility of mobilizing the willing support of such a diverse
population may have been due to what some have described as his wary,
mistrustful personality. His mode of leadership tended toward unyielding
enforcement of ostensibly logical policies and did not include the flexible toler-
ation of differences or the low-key charisma that had been characteristic of his
father.
Nevertheless, Le Van Khoi may not have dared to challenge Minh Mang had it
not been for events in the north that encouraged him to imagine a prospect of
restoring the Le dynasty. When the last Le king, Le Duy Khiem, had died in
China in1804, Gia Long sent the senior member of the Le family in Vietnam, Le
Duy Hoan, to escort his remains from the Qing border to Thanh Hoa Province,
where the Le family maintained its ancestral tombs. Le Duy Hoan apparently
harbored no illusions of dynastic restoration, but in1816 he allowed himself to
be used by a group of conspirators seeking to mobilize the north against Hue. He
was arrested and executed in1817. At that time, his infant son, Le Duy Luong
(1814–1833), was taken by a member of his father’s entourage into the moun-
tains of what is now Hoa Binh Province, located between the uplands of Thanh
Hoa and Hanoi, where he was given refuge by a prominent family surnamed
Quach. The Quach were leaders among the upland communities that would be
called Muong a century later, where loyalties to the Le dynasty remained alive.
The Quach were surely encouraged in their disaffection from Hue by the
rebellion led by Phan Ba Vanh in the coastal regions of what are now Nam
Dinh, Thai Binh, and Hai Phong Provinces. For the better part of a year in1826
and 1827, Phan Ba Vanh led armies estimated at more than five thousand men
and defeated Hue forces until men were mobilized against him from throughout
the Red River plain, Thanh Hoa, and Nghe An. When he was finally captured
and executed, survivors of his armies fled, and many of them took refuge in the
uplands. Phan Ba Vanh’s rebellion revealed that there were thousands of

Vietnamese in the north who were willing to follow a rebel against Hue. And his
ability to defeat royal armies in the lowlands for over half a year demonstrated
slack in Hue’s ability to mobilize and coordinate soldiers in the north. Through-
out the months of Phan Ba Vanh’s rebellion, Minh Mang’s frustration was
expressed with sharp demands upon his commanders that they end the affair
without delay. His sense of threat was sufficiently alert that in1831 he sent
officials to Binh Dinh and Gia Dinh to capture over one hundred surviving
descendents of the Tay Son brothers. Twenty-nine of these were sentenced to
death, and forty were exiled, enslaved, or assigned as soldiers. The rest, mainly
women and children, were released.
In the spring of1832, soldiers on the upland frontier of Nghe An killed their
officers, burned down their outposts, seized weapons, and marched north
through the mountains, apparently to join the Quach who, according to infor-
mation at the Hue court, had plotted with the mutineers in the name of Le Duy
Luong. Unable to capture Le Duy Luong, Minh Mang executed a brother of his
who had been in prison since the arrest of their father, sixteen years before.
In the spring of1833, Le Duy Luong was proclaimed king in the uplands of
Hoa Binh Province. Many men from Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and the Red River
plain rallied to him, and leaders of the Quach family led armies into the plains
west and south of Hanoi and gained victories. For several weeks, local militia-
men defected to the rebels as royal commanders mobilized their forces. By mid
summer, Le Duy Luong’s partisans had been pushed back into the mountains,
and, at the end of summer, he was captured and beheaded. Minh Mang subse-
quently forcibly removed surviving members of the Le family from Thanh Hoa
and resettled them in provinces south of Hue. Although the Le Duy Luong
uprising was relatively brief, it was enough to inspire an echoing uprising in
the south.
Le Van Khoi’s rebellion and war with Siam
In the spring of1833, Le Van Khoi was being investigated by Minh Mang’s
officials for irregularities in supplying lumber to shipyards when news arrived
that Le Duy Luong had been proclaimed king and that two or three provinces in
the north had already come under his control. Le Van Khoi reportedly received a
message from Le Duy Luong calling on him to rise against the Hue monarchy. If
he did in fact receive such a message, it implies that he had been in some kind of
prior contact with Le Duy Luong’s group. Two months after the outbreak of Le
Duy Luong’s uprising in the north, at a time when Le Duy Luong’s armies
appeared to be building momentum and just prior to suffering defeats, Le Van

Khoi mobilized a large following and killed the upper echelon of Minh Mang’s
officials at Saigon. Within a few days, men at the other provincial centers in the
Mekong plain killed or drove off Hue officials and recognized Le Van Khoi’s
authority.
Le Van Khoi’s immediate entourage was mostly comprised of Le Van Duyet’s
old circle of officials, including officers of the militia organizations of former
insurgents from Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, the men with whom Le Van Khoi had
come south under Le Van Duyet’s leadership more than ten years earlier.
Christians, Chinese, and other minority groups, as well as mainstream local
Vietnamese, also rallied to him. For about three months, as Minh Mang was
suppressing Le Duy Luong in the north, Le Van Khoi and his followers were
ascendant in the south.
Minh Mang viewed the southern uprising as the outcome of a long-standing
problem related to Le Van Duyet’s heterodox regime. He announced that Le Van
Duyet had neglected the law and ignored social discipline, had not encouraged
righteous behavior, allowed many illegalities and tolerated evil customs, such as
gambling and lasciviousness among his officials. Consequently, the southerners
had become arrogant, lazy, and rebellious. He was particularly concerned about
the many surrendered rebels and banished criminals from the north who filled
the southern militia units. He cautioned his generals that these men were not a
rabble but were experienced soldiers and desperate outlaws. Meanwhile, he
ordered that members of Le Van Khoi’s family in Cao Bang be seized. Fourteen
people were arrested, including a brother and two sons of Le Van Khoi. The fact
that these relatives of Le Van Khoi were found in Cao Bang shows that the family
was part of a network of contacts that stretched from the northernmost to
the southernmost parts of the country. The significance of this lay not only
in the resonance between the Le Duy Luong and Le Van Khoi uprisings, but
also in the rebellion of Nong Van Van, which erupted at this same time in the
mountains north of Tuyen Quang, just west of Cao Bang.
Nong Van Van was a local chieftain of this region. He was also the elder brother
of Le Van Khoi’s wife. For the better part of the next two years, he led armies of
several thousands and dominated most of the upland territory east of the Red
River as far as the Qing border, comprising the modern provinces of Ha Giang,
Tuyen Quang, Cao Bang, Bac Can, Thai Nguyen, and Lang Son. As Minh Mang’s
armies gradually pacified these mountain jurisdictions during1834, Nong Van
Van sought refuge across the border, but Qing officials, alerted by Minh Mang,
refused him asylum. In the spring of1835, he was finally cornered in a thick forest
where he perished when royal troops set the trees afire in a strong wind.
The Le Duy Luong, Le Van Khoi, and Nong Van Van uprisings were in some
degree coordinated by contacts among the rebel leaders. But they were also

coordinated with the plans of Rama III of Siam, who, after subduing the lowland
Lao, was determined to wrest Cambodia away from Minh Mang. Le Van Khoi, after
his initial success, and while waiting for the inevitable arrival of Hue’s armies, sent a
messenger to Rama III, supposedly asking for Siamese assistance. The content of his
message is no longer known, but it may have been primarily to inform Rama III
about events at Saigon and to indicate that the time for action had arrived. Within
weeks, Siamese armies appeared at several strategic points along the western borders
of Vietnam. Siamese military demonstrations occurred on the Xieng Khouang
frontier of Nghe An, where the1832 mutiny had occurred, on the western border
of Ha Tien, and on the Cam Lo Road that crossed the mountains to Quang Tri, only
a short distance north of Hue. These operations were intended to divert Minh
Mang’s attention from Cambodia, where the main Siamese invasion occurred.
In autumn of 1833, tens of thousands of Siamese soldiers marched into
Cambodia along both shores of the Tonle Sap to rendezvous with a seaborne
expedition moving up the Vinh Te Canal from Ha Tien to the Mekong River.
King Ang Chan escaped downriver where the situation among the Vietnamese
had by then dramatically changed in Minh Mang’s favor as a result of the actions
of Thai Cong Trieu.
Thai Cong Trieu was a man from the Hue area whom Le Van Duyet had
learned to trust. In1830, at Le Van Duyet’s request, he was made second-in-
command of all military forces in the south. When Minh Mang reorganized the
south, Thai Cong Trieu became the senior military officer. He maintained good
relations with local people while retaining his loyalty to Hue. When Le Van Khoi
and his followers made their bid for power, he chose to go with them rather than
be killed. He became the commander of the rebel army that took control of the
provincial centers at My Tho, Vinh Long, Chau Doc, and Ha Tien. Le Van Khoi
and his closest associates occupied themselves at Saigon and Bien Hoa. When
seaborne armies from Hue began to appear at the mouths of southern rivers,
Thai Cong Trieu was in the Chau Doc area on the Cambodian frontier. He sent a
message to Truong Minh Giang (d.1841), commander of the Hue forces,
affirming his loyalty to Minh Mang despite having been coerced into joining
the rebels. He then assisted men loyal to Hue who had survived the rebellion and
had gone into hiding to expel Le Van Khoi’s partisans and to reassert royal
government in Ha Tien, Chau Doc, Vinh Long, and My Tho. From My Tho he
advanced his men toward Saigon in coordination with Truong Minh Giang. Thai
Cong Trieu’s role in the events of1833 was crucial for minimizing the effects of
Le Van Khoi’s rebellion and for enabling Truong Minh Giang to concentrate his
forces against the Siamese.
Le Van Khoi and several thousand of his most fervent followers, mainly
Christians, banished militiamen, and Chinese, took refuge in the huge Saigon

fortress that had been renovated by Le Van Duyet and was stocked with enough
weaponry and provisions to withstand a long siege. Le Van Khoi died in early
1834from an eruption of tumors. Nguyen Van Cham, leader of the banished
militiamen, thereafter exercised command among the besieged. The fortress held
out for another year and a half. In autumn of1835, it fell. Five hundred and fifty-
four ringleaders and their families were beheaded on the spot. One thousand two
hundred and seventy-eight people, being lower-ranking rebels and their families,
were seized alive and later killed, buried in a large common grave. Six hundred
and sixty-six of those killed were reportedly Christians. Six persons, including
Nguyen Van Cham, the Chinese leader Luu Tin, a French missionary named
Joseph Marchand, and one of Le Van Khoi’s sons, were taken to Hue and
publicly executed. The Saigon fortress was demolished. Meanwhile, Minh
Mang’s attention had moved on to the Siamese in Cambodia.
Truong Minh Giang was from the Saigon region, had passed the1819 regional
exam, and, despite his youth, had risen to the top echelon of Minh Mang’s court
during the 1820s. In 1833, Minh Mang chose him to be in charge of settling
matters in the south and dealing with the Siamese in Cambodia. He spent the
eight remaining years of his life on this assignment, gaining a reputation for
severity among the Khmer and for competence among the Vietnamese.
By the time that Truong Minh Giang was able to turn his attention from
Saigon in late1833, the Siamese had already advanced into the region of the
Vinh Te Canal between Ha Tien and Chau Doc, and Ang Chan and his court had
arrived in Vinh Long seeking protection from the invaders. The Siamese brought
along from Bangkok two of Ang Chan’s younger brothers, Ang Im and Ang
Duong, to assist with their plan of occupying all of Cambodia. In a series of
battles in late1833 and early1834, Truong Minh Giang forced the Siamese out
of Cambodia. As the Siamese withdrew back along the two shores of the Tonle
Sap, they plundered and destroyed habitations and forced the able-bodied popu-
lation to move west under their control. Great numbers of elderly people were
left to fend for themselves and died in the ravaged countryside. Truong Minh
Giang restored Ang Chan to Phnom Penh. However, the country was devastated
with a large part of the population deported to Siamese territory and much of the
countryside laid waste. The Siamese occupation had been brief but destructive.
Rama III had not been prepared for such a sudden confrontation with large
Vietnamese armies so had simply done his best to degrade the assets of the
Khmer protectorate.
Ang Chan died in 1835. There was no prince to manage the relationship
between the Vietnamese suzerains and the Khmer people as successfully as he
had done. He had no sons, but he had four daughters. His eldest daughter
favored the Siamese, as did her two uncles in Bangkok, Ang Im and Ang Duong.

The Vietnamese could think of nothing better than to hail Ang Chan’s second
daughter, Ang Mei, as the Queen of Cambodia. However, Ang Mei had no
political ability and exerted no discernible influence on public affairs. The task
of government fell upon Truong Minh Giang, who was subject to the instructions
of Minh Mang. Minh Mang decided to simply extend to Cambodia the adminis-
trative reforms that he had already implemented in Hanoi and Saigon, which
amounted to the annexation of Cambodia behind the façade of Ang Mei’sr o y a l
court. In 1836, Truong Minh Giang reorganized local Khmer jurisdictions,
appointed Vietnamese officials to oversee the Khmer governors of provinces, and
established garrisons of Khmer and Vietnamese soldiers at strategic locations.
In 1836, Rama III built up his military forces in Battambang and Siem Reap,
the parts of northwestern Cambodia that had already been annexed by Siam. The
Khmer princes, Ang Im and Ang Duong, were sent to the frontier to rally support
for the Siamese among the Khmer. During the next three years, the Siamese
General Bodin and Truong Minh Giang endeavored to destabilize each other’s
positions with intrigues, raids, and uprisings.
In 1839, Truong Minh Giang succeeded in persuading Ang Im, the elder of the
two princes, to come over to the Vietnamese side. Ang Im’s expectation of being
made king by the Vietnamese was disabused when he was unceremoniously
hustled off to Hue. Rama III returned Ang Duong to Bangkok for safekeeping,
proclaimed him the King of Cambodia, and prepared for war. Truong Minh
Giang sent Ang Mei, along with her two younger sisters, to Saigon. He killed her
anti-Vietnamese elder sister to remove what had become a magnet for pro-
Siamese conspiracies. In1840, Bodin launched a general offensive. At the same
time, Siamese agents inspired uprisings among the Khmer downriver in Vietnam-
ese territory. After nearly two years of fighting, the new Vietnamese king, Thieu
Tri, was persuaded to redeploy out of Cambodia in order to concentrate upon
the disorders in the rear of his armies. Thieu Tri ordered Truong Minh Giang to
withdraw, blaming him for having been unable to prevent the situation from
reaching such an impasse. When he arrived at Chau Doc in the autumn of1841,
having retreated completely out of Cambodia, Truong Minh Giang, over-
whelmed with a sense of failure, stopped eating and died of chagrin, less than a
year after the death of Minh Mang.
Thieu Tri and the French navy
In1838, when it seemed that he had prevailed over the last echoes of the Le
dynasty, had perfectly unified the country, and had achieved his ambitions in
Cambodia, Minh Mang celebrated by renaming his realm Dai Nam,“Great

South.” Barely three years later, he died after a fall from a horse, amidst a war
with Siam that would erase what he thought he had achieved in Cambodia. Minh
Mang’s death also came during the Opium War of1839–1842, in which a British
expeditionary force humbled Qing China and obtained possession of Hong
Kong, thereby opening a new era when European warships began to appear
regularly in Vietnamese coastal waters. During the short reign of Minh Mang’s
son and successor, Thieu Tri (r.1840–1847), the Siamese in Cambodia and the
Europeans offshore pulled the attention of the Hue court in two directions.
Thieu Tri, Minh Mang’s eldest son, was born in1807. He was well educated,
highly cultured, and intelligent. He was also reluctant to change his father’s
policies except under duress. He lacked the strength of mind to see beyond
immediate problems, and he was vulnerable to the schemes of ambitious officials.
The main features of his reign were ending the Siamese war, continuing the anti-
Christian measures begun by Minh Mang, albeit without the use of capital
punishment, and suffering humiliating confrontations with the French navy.
A salient consideration that had led to Truong Minh Giang’s recall from
Cambodia in 1841 was a Siamese-inspired rebellion among the downriver
Khmer population centered in the modern province of Tra Vinh, the deltaic
region lying between the two main branches of the Mekong River. For nine
months, beginning in spring1841, a charismatic Khmer named Lam Sam led
large armies that also included some Chinese and Vietnamese. Hue forces grad-
ually pressed Lam Sam’s army against the coast where he built defensive walls. In
the last month of the year his position was overrun, and he was captured and
killed. A Siamese offensive into Vietnam intended to coordinate with Lam Sam
was repulsed. Lam Sam’s uprising was a typical feature of Siamese–Vietnamese
warfare in the1830s and1840s as each side endeavored to rally Khmer partisans
to distract the other from the main battlefront.
Lam Sam’s rebellion was but the most spectacular of several Khmer uprisings
in the lower Mekong during the1840s. These uprisings, like the Le Duy Luong
uprising, Nong Van Van’s rebellion among the minority peoples in the northern
border provinces, and to some extent even Le Van Khoi’s rebellion, were part of
a countrywide reaction to Minh Mang’s effort to propagate and discipline a
stricter sense of Vietnamese cultural identity by promoting Confucian education,
eradicating Christianity, and erasing ethnic minorities. Minh Mang abandoned
the policy of Gia Long and Le Van Duyet that discouraged Vietnamese from
trespassing into territories inhabited by other ethnic groups. Instead, he pro-
moted a policy of assimilating ethnic minorities. For example, in the south,
Khmer and Vietnamese villages were combined into single jurisdictions, Viet-
namese villages were established in localities previously reserved for Khmer, and
Khmer were pressured to attend Vietnamese schools and to speak Vietnamese.

Similar policies were established among upland minorities. The Chinese were a
special problem, and Minh Mang moved more cautiously and with less effect
toward abolishing Chinese communal organizations. Thieu Tri continued Minh
Mang’s assimilating policies.
The Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia that had sunk Truong Minh
Giang in despair did not indicate any renunciation of Hue’s ambitions in Cam-
bodia but was simply a tactical response to the Siamese offensive and the
emergency of Lam Sam’s revolt. After Lam Sam’s movement had been sup-
pressed and the Siamese offensive was spent, the Vietnamese rebuilt their armies
and supply lines and pushed back across the border into the Khmer provinces
adjacent to the Vinh Te Canal, after which the war lapsed into an extended lull.
Khmer leaders wanted to find a way to make peace between the Siamese and
Vietnamese so that foreign armies would depart and a monarchy acceptable to
both sides could regain a measure of autonomy. Ang Duong, the Siamese
candidate for the Cambodian throne, was at Oudong under the watchful eyes
of the Siamese general Bodin. Ang Mei, Ang Duong’s niece, whom the Vietnam-
ese had poised as Queen of Cambodia in1835, and Ang Im, Ang Duong’s elder
brother, who had fallen into Vietnamese hands in1839, were in Vietnamese
custody at Saigon. Confidential messages passed among these people seeking
some way to negotiate an end to the war and a restoration of the Khmer
monarchy. While Ang Mei sought conciliation between Ang Duong and the
Vietnamese, Thieu Tri, revealing a typical Vietnamese concern with territorial
control, favored a partition of Cambodia with Ang Duong and Ang Im reigning
as kings in their respective pro-Siamese and pro-Vietnamese domains. The Siam-
ese opposed the idea of partition, being determined to gain control over all of
Cambodia.
Ang Im’s death in 1843 inspired Rama III to renew the war. Thinking to
capitalize on Ang Duong’s unassailable claim to the throne, he hastily ordered an
offensive against the Vietnamese. A Siamese attack by sea at Kampot was
intended to coordinate with a Khmer offensive downriver led by Ang Duong.
However, poor communication and misunderstandings resulted in the Siamese
expedition re-embarking and returning to Bangkok, leaving Ang Duong to face
the Vietnamese alone. The Vietnamese advanced, sending Ang Duong’s army
upriver in retreat. Bodin moved his forces downriver to secure Phnom Penh. He
then called out thousands of Khmers in forced labor to build lines of fortifica-
tions to protect Phnom Penh. The Khmers were suffering from chronic famine
caused by wartime conditions, and Bodin’s sense of urgency drove him to harsh
usage of the Khmers, which provoked anti-Siamese sentiments among local
Khmer leaders. After uncovering and suppressing a pro-Vietnamese plot against
Ang Duong led by the governors of Baphnom (Svay Rieng) and Prey Veng,

located near the Vietnamese border north of the Mekong River, Bodin went to
Bangkok to confer with Rama III.
Taking advantage of Bodin’s absence from Cambodia, a group of Khmer
nobles, encouraged by the Vietnamese, conspired against Ang Duong. When he
learned of the conspiracy, Ang Duong quickly arrested eight of the conspirators;
four others escaped to Vietnam. Exasperated by this indication of Khmer support
for the Vietnamese, Rama III sent Bodin back to Cambodia with reinforcements
and instructions to expel the Vietnamese from there. However, before Bodin
could bring his armies into position, the Vietnamese attacked upriver in the
autumn of1845, breaking through the Siamese fortifications and taking Phnom
Penh. After months of fighting, a battle line was stabilized between Phnom Penh
and Oudong, and the war settled into a stalemate.
Peace negotiations began in early1846 and continued for over a year. An
agreement was finally ratified in late spring of1847. All fortifications were
demolished, Siamese and Vietnamese armies withdrew from the country, prison-
ers and hostages were exchanged, and Ang Duong supplied a message to Hue
that could be interpreted by the Vietnamese as submission. But the outcome of
the war favored the Siamese, who emphasized this by annexing two more
provinces in northern Cambodia, Preah Vihear and Stung Treng. Ang Duong
reigned under close Siamese supervision until1860 and has been remembered for
his efforts to rebuild his war-ravaged kingdom.
Thieu Tri’s acquiescence to the loss of the Cambodian protectorate, albeit
veiled by the fiction of joint Siamese–Vietnamese suzerainty, reflected not only
his relatively pacific temperament but also his deep concern, even anger, aroused
by the threatening appearance of French warships. French naval officers
demanded the release of imprisoned missionaries and the abolition of Minh
Mang’s anti-Christian edicts. Between1833 and 1838, Minh Mang had executed
ten European missionaries, six Frenchmen sent by the Paris Society for Foreign
Missions, three Spanish Dominicans from Manila, and one Franciscan. During
that same time many Vietnamese Christian leaders were also killed, churches
were demolished, and unknown numbers of Christians were deported to remote
upland areas. With the outbreak of the Opium War in1839 and the landing of
an army from British India in Guangdong, Minh Mang suspended further
executions of Europeans and sent envoys to Dutch Batavia, to Penang where
many Vietnamese Christians attended a French seminary, to Calcutta to meet
with the authorities of British India, and then on to Paris and London. He
apparently wanted to establish contact with the increasingly aggressive Euro-
peans in the region and to evaluate the extent to which the Sino-British War
would affect the security of his country. The envoys to Europe returned to Hue
after Minh Mang’s death, and this diplomatic initiative was bereft of results.

Thieu Tri upheld Minh Mang’s prohibition of Christianity and several Viet-
namese Christian leaders were put to death. Although European missionaries
were imprisoned and condemned to death during Thieu Tri’s reign, none of them
was executed. Thieu Tri lived in a world that had suddenly changed from that of
his father.
After the Opium War, the French navy began to patrol Asian waters in search
of a permanent base from which to spread the influence of France. Although
Tahiti was taken in1843, it was too far away to serve any Asian purpose.
A French scheme to build a naval base on the island of Basilan in the Philippines
was thwarted in1845 by Spanish and British objections. Meanwhile, French
naval officers were guests in Spanish Manila, Dutch Batavia, British Singapore
and Hong Kong, and Portuguese Macau. In early1843, a French naval captain,
learning in Macau that five French missionaries were imprisoned in Hue under
sentences of death, took his warship to Da Nang Bay on his own authority and,
after a week of negotiation and threats, obtained the release of the five men. This
fixed in Thieu Tri’s mind a connection between Christian missionaries and
foreign warships.
Two months after this episode, Admiral Jean Baptiste Cécille arrived in Asian
waters from France in command of a new French fleet. He spent a few weeks in
Da Nang Bay arguing fruitlessly with local mandarins about his request for a
cession of territory for a naval base and about the persecution of Christians. His
argument that the French would protect the Vietnamese from the British gained
no traction among Vietnamese officials, who were instructed to hasten the
departure of the uninvited visitors.
Dominique Lefèbvre (1810–1865), a French missionary, was imprisoned at
Hue under a sentence of death when the American Commodore John Percival
stopped at Da Nang in May1845 during his three-year circumnavigation of the
globe aboard the venerable USSConstitution. Hearing of the ship’s presence,
Lefèbvre managed to send a message to the Americans pleading for deliverance.
Percival failed to gain Lefèbvre’s release despite taking hostage three Vietnamese
officials and seizing three Vietnamese boats. After two weeks had passed without
achieving any result, Percival released the hostages and the boats, and then sailed
off. Four years later, the US consul at Singapore traveled to Da Nang to deliver a
formal apology for this episode and to convey the US government’s disavowal of
Percival’s actions.
Meanwhile, within a week of Percival’s departure from Da Nang, a French
warship arrived with a letter from Admiral Cécille demanding Lefèbvre’s release.
Thieu Tri, heavily engaged in Cambodia and worried about the affair with the
previously unknown Americans and its possible connection with the sudden
appearance of the French warship, complied, and Lefèbvre was allowed to

depart. After a sojourn in Singapore, Lefèbvre, in 1846, attempted to enter
the port of Saigon clandestinely but was caught and eventually sent to Hue.
In the spring of1847, while occupied with the final arrangements for concluding
the treaty of peace in Cambodia and not wanting any further complication
with the French, Thieu Tri sent Lefèbvre to Singapore. Unaware of this, Cécille
sent two warships to Da Nang with a letter demanding Lefèbvre’s release and an
end to the persecution of Christians.
After three weeks, failures of communication between the French naval offi-
cers and local Vietnamese officials led to a battle in which the French sank five
Vietnamese warships and destroyed the harbor forts with artillery fire. The
French then sailed off. The Vietnamese officially recorded40 sailors dead, 90
wounded, and 104 missing. The French recorded one dead and one wounded.
Behind this outbreak of violence was deep mutual suspicion. For example, in fear
of being taken hostage, the Vietnamese refused the French demand to deliver a
message from Hue aboard their ships, while the French, fearing an ambush,
refused the Vietnamese demand to come ashore to receive the message. The
French appear to have initiated hostilities when their nerves broke as Vietnamese
warships continued to arrive in the harbor. A few days after this battle, the
persistent Lefèbvre successfully entered the country by the Mekong River and
conducted his missionary work in hiding for the next twelve years until the
French seized Saigon.
Thieu Tri was deeply disturbed by the Da Nang battle, not only becauseof the
loss of men and material but also from a sense of impending doom unless he could
find a way to manage the threat posed by the French navy. He became grim and
prone to anger. For several days, the smallest irritation would cause him to erupt.
Guardsmen falling asleep on duty at night, an official who dared to arguewith
him, another official who made errors in preparing a document, all were punished
with eighty to a hundred strokes of the cane. Thieu Tri asked Truong Dang Que
(1794–1864), his most trusted official,“These Western ships come for only two
basic reasons: they want us to abolish the edicts against Christianity and they want
to trade. We can accommodate trade, but what about Christianity– can we allow
it?” Having just disengaged from the Cambodian confrontation with Siam, he was
looking for a way out of the seeming impasse with Western navies. He was
particularly concerned because of the geography of his country having such an
extensive coastline and being susceptible to being cut in half at its narrow center.
But the location of Hue was also a problem, being vulnerable to the sea but far
from the reservoirs of manpower and resources needed to defend it.
Truong Dang Que was from Quang Ngai. Although his father had served the
Tay Son, he was able to enter royal service at Hue after passing the1819 regional
examination. He rose rapidly to the top of court appointments under Minh

Mang and in1845 emerged as the most powerful minister at Thieu Tri’s court.
He reportedly answered Thieu Tri’s question, with more brevity than clarity, by
saying: “They started this, and we cannot expect them to be reasonable.”
Thieu Tri sensed that such an uncompromising attitude would not go far,
but he could not see a way forward. He was sufficiently intelligent to analyze the
situation with care and passionate enough to be thoroughly engaged with
the problem, but it was easy for him to postpone making decisions. According
to theTrue Records of the Great South(Dai Nam Thuc Luc), he reportedly said:
The Westerners are cunning. If we abolish our laws against Christianity,
the British will hear of it and demand that we abolish our laws against
opium. The Westerners are wolves: there is no way to satisfy them! What
can we do when everything must be according to their demands? More-
over, Christianity is a false religion and its harm to us has reached the
level of foreign relations and has opened the door to war. Opium is an
anesthetic, and it utterly ruins human lives. These two things are both
strictly forbidden and we will publicly affirm this so that it will be known
in the history written by future generations... The Westerners are not
simply one country. For example, the Dutch we never see and when they
send messages to us they are not from a king but from some strange
authority that we cannot understand. But the French, although we have
released them from prison many times, despite forbidding them to enter
our country, and we thereby deserve their thanks, still they sprout more
desperate schemes. Let us wait for the return of our traveling officials,
and we can ask them about French intentions. If this enemy has some
aggressive idea, Saigon and Hai Phong will also be places of danger, not
only Da Nang.
With a strong orientation toward the opinions of moralistic historians in the
future, such was Thieu Tri’s prophetic but ultimately passive frame of mind
when, half a year later, in the autumn of1847, two British warships appeared
at Da Nang with proposals for a commercial treaty. The British were hoping to
contrast their friendly demeanor with the truculent impression left by the French.
But Thieu Tri would have none of it. Despite amicable greetings between the
British and local officials, the ships left empty-handed. While Thieu Tri under-
stood the French to be champions of Christianity, he understood the British to be
champions of opium. The idea of bending under foreign pressure to succumb to
either of these two calamities filled Thieu Tri with rage. Thieu Tri had been in
poor health for a month already. A few days after the British departed, he died at
the age of41, according to some reports, of apoplexy.
Mention of traveling officials refers to an established practice of regularly
sending men to Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Batavia to buy merchandise

for the court and to collect news. Information about the outside world was not
lacking at Hue. What was lacking was leadership capable of processing and
acting on information. Minh Mang had built a centralized structure of authority
at Hue, but his successors, erudite prisoners of palace life, tended to rely upon the
initiative of experienced officials. The chief priority for the most ambitious and
successful of senior officials was to ensure their continued exercise of power.
Thieu Tri’s weak, hesitating leadership opened space for such men.
Tu Duc’s accession and incapacity to rule
Until 1845, two men shared influence at the top of Thieu Tri’s court, Truong
Dang Que and Nguyen Dang Tuan (1772–1845). Nguyen Dang Tuan was
from Quang Binh, a short distance north of Hue. Both Nguyen Dang Tuan
and Truong Dang Que had been prominent in implementing the administrative
reforms and in suppressing the rebellions during Minh Mang’s reign. They also
administered the examination system to diminish the dominance of northern
scholars in favor of men from the south. While the percentage of junior doctors
from the north declined only slightly from the reign of Minh Mang to the reign
of Thieu Tri, from60 percent to58 percent, the percentage of northern doctors
fell from 85 percent in Minh Mang’s reign to54 percent in Thieu Tri’s reign.
Nguyen Dang Tuan and Truong Dang Que led a southern reaction to northern
success in Minh Mang’s examinations. The examinations were not simply
objective measures of ability but were an aspect of administrative policy and
of regional politics.
After Nguyen Dang Tuan’s death in 1845, Truong Dang Que gained a
dominant position at court. His management of the succession upon Thieu Tri’s
death greatly weakened the monarchy. Thieu Tri’s two eldest sons were born
only one hundred days apart in1829. The eldest, Hong Bao, was Thieu Tri’s
designated heir. Thieu Tri had conferred upon him duties and titles giving him
precedence over his slightly younger brother, Hong Nham, including a dynastic
ceremony upon the birth of Hong Bao’s first son in1845. However, Hong Bao’s
mother had died when he was9 and Nguyen Dang Tuan had been his chief
protector at court. Nguyen Dang Tuan’s son, Nguyen Dang Giai, was unable to
compete with Truong Dang Que in court politics after the death of his father and
spent years on an assignment to analyze the system of dikes in the Red River
plain. Consequently, Hong Bao was nearly bereft of allies in the palace and in
officialdom.
Truong Dang Que favored Hong Nham because he was more malleable to his
purposes. Hong Nham suffered a bout of smallpox in1845 that was said to have

left him sterile. Exceedingly erudite, he was sickly and less assertive than Hong
Bao. But his mother was a dominant figure in the inner palace. Truong Dang Que
or one of his assistants altered or forged Thieu Tri’s deathbed testament to
designate Hong Nham over Hong Bao as heir. Truong Dang Que moved quickly
to proclaim Hong Nham king, subsequently known by his dynastic title as Tu
Duc. In this way, Truong Dang Que was able to maintain his dominant position
at court, albeit at the expense of peace in the royal family, many members of
which were disturbed by the denial of Hong Bao’s claim to the throne. Mean-
while, Hong Bao was not reconciled to Truong Dang Que’s coup and began
searching for ways to undo it.
Some sources suggest that when Thieu Tri died there were other claimants to
the throne besides his two eldest sons, for example Gia Long’s eldest grandson
My Duong, who had been considered by some as a rival to Minh Mang and who
had been disgraced in1824. During Thieu Tri’s reign there was strong sentiment
among members of the royal family to restore My Duong to his princely status,
but he was not a plausible candidate for the throne in1847. When he died in
1849, however, his family was reinstated into royalty under the leadership of his
eldest son Le Chung, who was entrusted with the duty of maintaining the
ancestral cult of his famous grandfather, Prince Canh. In consideration of the
youth of Thieu Tri’s sons, there were reportedly some arguments in favor of
Prince Kien An (1795–1849), a younger full brother of Minh Mang. Despite one
of his junior wives being a niece of Le Van Khoi, he had a reputation as a
competent and loyal stalwart of the royal family. There may have been discreet
talk, but certainly no action, on his behalf.
Hong Bao was kept in Hue under strict observation. Nevertheless, contacts
with French missionaries on his behalf were made, leading Christians to believe
that he favored their cause when in fact he may simply have been searching for a
way to escape from Hue. In1851, a scheme to smuggle him out of the country to
Singapore was uncovered and he was imprisoned. What the scheme was about is
obscure but it was said that he had planned to rally foreign support to claim what
he considered to be his inheritance. In1854, further intrigues led to his suicide in
prison, whether voluntary or forced is unknown, but rumors spread by his
partisans that it was a case of fratricide gained currency and this greatly dimin-
ished Tu Duc’s reputation. The Hong Bao affair followed Tu Duc throughout his
reign and kept him on the moral defensive. Twelve years later, in 1866,a
conspiracy to place Hong Bao’s son on the throne was uncovered.
Tu Duc became king under the handicaps of being widely viewed as a usurper
and of being unable to have children. If he had been a strong ruler he could
certainly have overcome these problems. But his erudition could not make up for
his timidity. The passion with which he penned commentaries on ancient history

turned to inarticulate fear and hatred when faced in his own time with the
spreading disorder of his government and the military might of France.
During the early years of Tu Duc’s reign, Truong Dang Que continued to use
the examination system in favor of the south, but he also particularly opened the
system to candidates from Nghe An and Ha Tinh, discriminating between those
provinces and Thanh Hoa, which bordered the Red River plain further north.
Before moving to Quang Ngai, Truong Dang Que’s ancestors had been estab-
lished in Ha Tinh, but to what extent any lingering sense of identification with
that region influenced his policies is unknown. In any case, the rise of scholar
families from Nghe An and Ha Tinh became a phenomenon of Tu Duc’s reign.
For example, during the exams held under Minh Mang and Thieu Tri,56 percent
of graduating doctors were from Thanh Hoa and the Red River plain, while in the
five exams held under Tu Duc before the beginning of the French conquest in1858,
only 39 percent of graduating doctors were from those places. At the same time,
while only15 percent of graduating doctors under Minh Mang and Thieu Tri were
from the Nghe An and Ha Tinh region,26 percent of the graduating doctors in Tu
Duc’s first five exams were from those two provinces. During the same time, the
graduating doctors from places further south increased from29 percent to 35
percent. This trend continued during the remaining exams held during Tu Duc’s
reign, between1862 and 1880, when the number of graduates from the northern-
most region remained fairly steady while those from Nghe An and Ha Tinh
increased at the expense of the south:42 percent for Thanh Hoa and the Red River
plain, 30 percent for Nghe An and Ha Tinh, and27 percent for the south.
During Tu Duc’s reign, men from Nghe An and Ha Tinh became relatively more
prominent in officialdom. Rather than identifying with the dynasty to the same
extent as officials from places further south, they tended to be more committed to
the abstract ideals of their Confucian education. In comparison, scholars from
Thanh Hoa and the Red River plain were more diverse and more susceptible to a
perfunctory and somewhat cynical obedience to Hue. None of the Nguyen kings
was successful in using the examination system to unify officialdom. The system
was an arena for the negotiation of personal and regional aspirations.
During the first ten years of Tu Duc’s reign, while he was in his twenties and
before the beginning of the French invasion, unrest and rebellion became endemic
in many parts of the country, particularly in the north. A large number of royal
officials were kept employed with chasing insurgents. The most famous rebel from
this time is Cao Ba Quat (1809–1855). He was from a highly educated family in
the Hanoi area. He passed the regional exam in1831, but, although he quickly
gained a reputation for erudition and poetic skill, his lack of regard for rules and
regulations prevented him from gaining the doctoral degree at the capital examin-
ations. When he somehow managed to gain an appointment as a regional

examination grader at Hue in1841, he revised the exam essays of some candidates
who were acquaintances of his to give them a pass. When this was discovered, only
Thieu Tri’s clemency kept him from the penalty of death. Two years later, Thieu
Tri gave him a chance to rehabilitate himself with an assignment to go on a mission
to Batavia, and thereafter he was posted as an education officer near Hanoi, a
position that he considered to be an insult to his ability.
In 1854, Cao Ba Quat joined with a Le dynasty pretender named Le Duy Cu
and openly rebelled. For five months he and his associates spread havoc in Son
Tay Province, west and north of Hanoi, until he was killed by musket fire during
a battle. Le Duy Cu was not captured until the summer of1855. Meanwhile, in
early 1855, two of Cao Ba Quat’s former students were captured and killed when
they led an uprising in Hung Yen Province, a short distance downriver from
Hanoi. Later in the year, five of his disciples were captured in the Hanoi area and
sentenced to death for their subversive activities.
In 1859, when French forces were landing in the south, a son and a nephew of
Cao Ba Quat were captured and killed while following one of the Le pretenders
that proliferated in the north during the1850s and1860s. Le pretenders and men
of Cao Ba Quat’s caliber were only the most prominent among the rebel leaders
that sprang up at this time. In addition to“rebels” there were even more leaders
of bandits and fugitives who were active not only in the north but also in other
parts of the country. Furthermore, in1850 the Taiping Rebellion, which ravaged
Qing China for two decades, broke out in Guangxi, just across the northern
border. The human debris of that great disorder spilled over into the northern
mountains of Vietnam. Qing rebel leaders gained control of large parts of the
northern uplands and became allies of local outlaws.
According to theTrue Records of the Great South, three months after Cao Ba
Quat’s death, Tu Duc reportedly made a lengthy analysis of the problems in the
north. From his perspective, Cao Ba Quat had opened a floodgate of unrest in the
north:“Suddenly last year, because of that wayward official Cao Ba Quat, plots
to incite the people to rise in rebellion were like the noise of many gathering
mosquitoes becoming claps of thunder. At first they disturbed only hamlets and
villages, but then they struck whole districts and provinces.” The young king,
who never ventured far from his palace, tried to understand what was going on
in the north and concluded that there were five reasons for the outbreak of
rebellions.
The first reason was misgovernment by local officials:
Our court has often given generous assistance to the people with great
expense to our treasury, but local officials, following their custom, greed-
ily take the money for themselves no matter what the occasion, thereby

defeating our generosity, and so royal favor does not reach down to the
people; the people are full of resentment, they become careless of life, and
desperately rush down the path of destruction without knowing what
they are doing. Rebellion arises naturally not just because of the incite-
ment of violent and cruel men, but more truly because of bad, greedy,
heartless officials.
The second reason was the poor quality of royal soldiers:“Soldiers are only
concerned with satisfying their service contract with their villages. They are not
properly trained and, without discipline, they become discontented and commit
evil deeds.”
The third reason was the selfish ignorance of villagers that left them vulnerable
to rabble-rousers:
Common people compete among themselves and are untrustworthy.
They seek personal advantage and disdain righteousness. They encourage
each other to gather in the markets to drink, gamble, and play around.
Fortune-tellers mislead them and lying bullies victimize them. One cup of
wine makes a gang of bandits. One idle word can provoke a battle. When
they are defeated it is too late for them.
The fourth reason was the gangsters who were nurtured in the households of
the wealthy: “Among rural notables and village worthies, every wealthy house
has servants, sixty to a hundred men, among whom accumulate hooligans with
plenty of weapons. Local people are coerced to do their bidding and even local
officials fear to report their lawless behavior, so higher authorities do not know
what is going on in the villages.”
The fifth reason was the dense population in villages and their maze-like
intersecting roads and paths, which enabled fugitives to escape and hide.
These five considerations apparently represented the best thought at the Hue
court about how to explain the northern disorders. What they reveal is a lack of
effective government. Tu Duc, or whoever wrote the analysis, appears to under-
stand the structural problem of governing the Red River plain from Hue:“I want
to establish a policy to maintain lasting order, but evil rises from the people, and
I can but guess about unforeseen affairs so far away.” Yet, rather than addressing
the problems with concrete measures, the analysis ends with a weak moral
appeal for officials to work harder. The analysis and the conclusion are charac-
teristic of Tu Duc’s intellectual perspicuity and practical incompetence. When he
understood the problem, he could think of nothing better than to pass responsi-
bility for plans and action to his officials.
The five-point analysis reveals corrupt magistrates, disaffected soldiers, and
local bullies, phenomena that had been typical of Vietnamese villages for

centuries. Yet the scale of dysfunctional government was apparently excessive,
tempting desperate or alienated people into open rebellion. The repeated appear-
ance of Le dynasty pretenders indicates, more than sixty years after the end of the
Le dynasty, the inability of the Hue court to firmly establish its legitimacy among
the people in the north. This inability was a failure to overcome the physical and
mental distance between Hanoi and Hue. More prosaically, it was a failure to
provide a modicum of security and justice.
Meanwhile, the Hue court returned to Minh Mang’s anti-Christian policy of
the 1830s, thereby attracting the attention of the French navy and of Louis
Napoleon’s government in Paris. Among the most prominent of Truong Dang
Que’s collaborators was Nguyen Tri Phuong (1800–1873), from the Hue region,
who specialized in military affairs. He had traveled to Manila and Singapore in
the early1830s, had assisted in putting down the Le Van Khoi rebellion, was
prominent in the Siamese war of the1840s, and spent much of the1850si n
Saigon suppressing southern unrest, watching the Siamese, and securing the
Cambodian border. After the1847 Battle of Da Nang, his attitude toward the
French became hostile, and he accordingly became a determined foe of Chris-
tianity. Under his influence and the influence of other officials with similar views,
including Truong Dang Que, the persecution of Christians gained new life after
the death of Thieu Tri. In1848, an edict prescribed death for foreign missionaries
and banishment or imprisonment for Vietnamese Christians. In1851, the death
penalty was extended to Vietnamese clergy. Within the next year, two French
missionaries were beheaded in the north, and the execution of Vietnamese priests
was resumed.
The threat from Europe
The French navy was increasingly active along the Chinese coast in the early
1850s, collaborating and competing with the British and the Americans for
treaty privileges and territorial concessions. But it was not until the end of the
Crimean War in1856 that Louis Napoleon was prepared to initiate a policy
toward Vietnam. The British had obtained a commercial treaty with Siam in
1855, and Louis Napoleon sent Charles de Montigny (1805–1868) to Bangkok
to obtain a similar treaty. Montigny had gone out to the Chinese coast with the
French navy as a member of a diplomatic mission in1843. He subsequently spent
the rest of his career in the French diplomatic service in China, serving as the first
French consul in Shanghai (1848–1853) and later as consul at Tientsin (1863–
1868). He was experienced in Chinese affairs but had little knowledge of Siam,
Cambodia, and Vietnam, the countries placed on his 1856 itinerary. His

Vietnamese agenda was to obtain a treaty protecting Christians and to open the
country to trade.
The plan was for Montigny to appear in Vietnamese waters with a naval escort
that would support his negotiations with a show of force. However, poor
coordination between Montigny and the navy resulted in Montigny’s ship arriv-
ing four months after the navy had come and gone. The first of two naval vessels
assigned to meet Montigny at Da Nang, a new steam-powered warship, arrived
at Da Nang in September1856. Waiting for Montigny, the ship’s captain was
frustrated by the cold welcome he received from local officials. Feeling
threatened by what he interpreted as Vietnamese military preparations, he bom-
barded and demolished the harbor forts. By the time Montigny arrived in early
1857, the navy had long since departed and the Vietnamese were uninterested in
talking with him.
When the French warship had first arrived at Da Nang in September1856,
local officials reported to Hue that the French captain threatened that if the
Vietnamese king did not agree to negotiate a treaty with the soon-to-arrive
French envoy, it would be reported to the British navy, which would then arrive
with unpleasant consequences for the Vietnamese. If this report was correct, it
reveals an interesting use of the British by the French for making threats,
suggesting that the French lacked confidence in their own reputation. In response
to this news, Hue ordered that military units be put on the alert and that patrols
be maintained to watch for any additional ships. If the French should attempt to
sneak ashore, the intruders were to be confronted,“so that they will know that
we are prepared.”
A few days later, news reached Hue that the French had bombarded and
destroyed the harbor fortresses. Tu Duc was reportedly upset by this and said:
The provincial officials did not know how to be prepared. Reading their
report makes it sound like they were only a few feeble people in a
situation beyond their means. Considering that this one Western ship
was beneath our forts and that a ship can contain but a certain number of
shells and furthermore that it must shoot them slowly and deliberately,
how could the shells from this ship have come down like rain as claimed
in the report? Furthermore, our soldiers were at higher elevations with
strong fortifications. How could this ship destroy every one of our
emplacements but we could not shoot the ship? Surely our troops did
not have the heart to fight with the enemy, so they schemed in fear to
simply save their lives.
This reaction to the Da Nang action contains four points of interest. First, Tu
Duc had no understanding of the technical disparity between modern Western
warships and Vietnamese coastal batteries. Second, he did not know the

difference between giving a command and ensuring that it was executed. Third,
he was easily distracted from the reality of a situation by quibbles over the use of
a metaphor, in this case his objection to mention of French shells coming down
like rain. Finally, and most tellingly, he was fully prepared to attribute cowardice
to his own soldiers. His scolding comments echo the analysis of northern insur-
gency recorded two years before. Trouble comes from the bad performance of
officials and soldiers. It did not occur to him that failure could be caused by
anything other than people not correctly performing their duties.
Unlike Japanese leaders, who quickly understood the threat posed by Western
navies and who were willing to accept revolutionary change in order to respond
to it, Vietnamese leaders phlegmatically watched an increasingly rampant French
fleet materialize off their coasts during the course of nearly two decades. Finding
themselves in a world dominated by military technology and organization
beyond what they possessed, Vietnamese leaders took comfort in being members
of a civilized world led by China. Like Japan, Vietnam was vulnerable to hostile
sea power. But unlike Japanese leaders, who even after more than two centuries
of peace had retained the samurai’s sensitivity to military affairs, Vietnamese
rulers, like their counterparts in China, were educated in literature, history, and
philosophy. What appeared to be plausible for China, however, did not hold for
Vietnam. Vietnam lacked the vast hinterland that enabled China to project an air
of sovereignty despite the loss of control over its coasts.
On the eve of the French conquest, leaders at Hue faced an impasse. The moral
values on which they believed their society was built did not let them agree to
legalize either Christianity or opium. Yet, accepting the treaty demands of the
Western powers whose warships threatened their harbors meant opening their
country both to Christianity and to opium. Expectations of being able to prevail
in this confrontation may appear unrealistic from the perspective of later events,
but these men had no choice but to resist as best they could, for they were not
prepared to change their fundamental view of what it meant to be civilized.
After Montigny’s visit to Da Nang, a new anti-Christian edict was published
and a fresh wave of persecution passed through Vietnamese Christian commu-
nities. In July of1857, a Spanish missionary was executed in northern Vietnam.
Dominicans based in Manila maintained an active mission in the Red River
plain. Little more than a year later, a joint Franco-Spanish expedition was
prepared to forcibly open the country.
The issue of Christianity in motivating French and Spanish military action
against Vietnam, while superficially apparent, was not fundamental. Christianity
had been a discernible part of Vietnamese society for over three hundred years
before the French conquest. Vietnamese rulers had attempted to discourage
Christianity from time to time when urged on by their Confucian advisors, but

Christians were largely integrated into normal society. For example, in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Christian soldiers in the north were
allowed to take their oaths of loyalty in the name of their own religion rather
than in the name of the traditional mountain spirit. Relations between commu-
nities of Christians and non-Christians were overwhelmingly peaceful.
The virulence of the anti-Christian policy initiated by Minh Mang, while built
upon conventional Confucian views, more immediately expressed fear of Euro-
pean imperial intentions. It arose at the time of the First Anglo-Burmese War
(1824–1826) and was accompanied by a wave of anti-Christian propaganda in
Vietnam that was unprecedented in associating Christianity with European
imperialism. The participation of Christians in Le Van Khoi’s uprising confirmed
the Hue court in a view of Christians as disloyal and prone to rebellion.
Furthermore, Christianity offended Minh Mang’s passion for enforcing uniform-
ity in all aspects of his country’s life. By the time that decades of anti-Christian
propaganda and persecution had developed into the outbreaks of violence
between Christians and non-Christians of the1860s, 1870s, and1880s, during
the years of French conquest, the association of Christians with French aggres-
sion had hardened in the minds of many royal officials and of others educated to
be influenced by them.
When missionaries were the only Frenchmen in Vietnam, their importance to
French policy appeared much larger than it actually was. The significance of
Christianity for drawing French imperial interest toward Vietnam wore off
within weeks of the landing of the Franco-Spanish expeditionary forces at Da
Nang near the end of summer in1858. In the calculations of Louis Napoleon and
his chief advisors, the religious question was a convenient explanation to rally
Spanish participation and public support for military action in Vietnam, but
economic and political considerations were more fundamental. Men with little
patience for religion built French Indochina. Naval officers led the way in their
search for an Asian seaport and a river route to the back door of China to gain an
advantage over the British, who policed China’s front doors. The British seizure
of lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852–1853 aroused
French fears of the British gaining the Chinese back door through Burma and
of failure to compete for colonial territories. The new Prussian navy began to
appear in Asian waters by the mid1850s and provoked apprehensions of
another competitor.
In the late1870s and early1880s, under the Third Republic, industrialists and
merchants became the driving force for expanding the colonial holdings in
Vietnam. Then, beginning in the mid1880s, colonial administrators began to
pursue a vision of building a modern Asian state to demonstrate the imperial
genius of France. By the turn of the twentieth century, the creative energy of the

French to initiate change in Vietnam had been mostly spent. Aside from a great
surge of investment in the1920s, French rule in Vietnam would thereafter be a
holding operation as initiative for change shifted to the Vietnamese.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the new country of Vietnam
appeared in a world of great and constant change. In the1820s and 1830s,
Minh Mang endeavored to centralize his authority over all Vietnamese and to
establish his realm as a major regional power, imagining that seaborne threats
could be kept at bay. In the1840s and1850s, however, the imperial powers of
Europe gained momentum, riding their superior technology, their military dis-
cipline, and their visions of great achievements. At the same time, Vietnam
slipped into a ferment of insubordination without effective leadership. Tu Duc
was isolated from disturbing events, never traveled far from his palace, and had
no policy aside from avoiding change. What ensued for the Hue monarchy was a
painful process of being forced to accept change. By the late1880s, Vietnamese
kings had become functionaries of a colonial regime.

10 THE FRENCH CONQUEST
The Treaty of Saigon, 1862
French rule in Vietnam was established over a period of fifty years through a
process that had several phases. Between1857 and 1862, the French decision to
launch an expedition against Vietnam was made and implemented, resulting in
the Treaty of Saigon, which granted France possession of the region surrounding
Saigon. Between1862 and 1874, Vietnamese efforts to negotiate a French
departure failed as the naval officers who governed at Saigon annexed the rest
of the Mekong plain to create the colony of Cochinchina. They also established a
protectorate over Cambodia and sent an expedition up the Mekong, which
determined that this was not a feasible route to China.
Consequently, French interest shifted to northern Vietnam and the Red River
route to Yunnan, leading to a rapid conquest of the Red River plain in1873.
This, however, was quickly disavowed by the new Third Republic government of
France, still reeling over the disaster of the Franco-Prussian War and the civil war
between the Paris Communards and the National Guard. With the Treaty of
1874, France evacuated the Red River plain but established a loose“protector-
ate” over the Hue monarchy with joint Franco-Vietnamese customs stations at
Hanoi, Hai Phong, and Qui Nhon.
In the early1880s, rising commercial and industrial interests in France super-
seded the agenda of the navy. Furthermore, a great spasm of competition among
European imperial powers for colonial territories led to a firm French determin-
ation to ensure the exclusion of potential British or German interference in
Vietnam. The French government decided to take possession of the entire coun-
try. In1883, the French occupied Hue and forced the Vietnamese monarchy to
accept their“protection.”
During the next twelve years, France gained control of northern Vietnam
through a series of events that involved a war with China and a committed
program of pacification. A brief war with Siam in1893 enabled France to

establish a protectorate over Laos. Efforts to put in order the administrative and
financial arrangements for governing the pacified and protected territories were
repeatedly initiated from the mid1880s to the mid1890s as a cadre of colonial
officials with visions of an Asian colonial state accumulated in Saigon, Hue, and
Hanoi.
During the governor generalship of Paul Doumer (1897–1902), French Indo-
china was organized on a fiscal and administrative basis that would endure with
minor adjustments to the end of French rule in1945. As a strategic bloc directed
from Hanoi, Indochina without the French has in some respects continued into
more recent times. Doumer, a prominent figure in French politics, created a
regime of taxation, public works, centralized government, scientific investiga-
tion, and scholarly inquiry that defined the French colonial achievement among
the Vietnamese. The inability of later governor generals to significantly change
this regime defined the ultimate failure of the French to adjust to the conse-
quences of their rule among the Vietnamese.
The events culminating in Paul Doumer’s term as governor general of French
Indochina were initiated forty years earlier in the summer of1857. In the wake of
the fiasco of Montigny’s mission a few months earlier, Louis Napoleon, Emperor of
France, convened a commission to study the question of policy toward Vietnam.
Members of the commission included representatives of the navy, the Foreign
Ministry, and the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works. Their
report recommended intervention to achieve three goals. The primary consideration
was a strongly felt need to be part of the European presence in Asia. The British,
Dutch, Portuguese, Russians, and Spanish were all established in Asia. Participation
with the British in the Crimean War demonstrated that France had emerged from its
post-Napoleonic caution and could seek its place in the constellation of European
powers. The British, who had tutored French foreign policy since Waterloo, were
distracted in1857 by rebellion in India and the outbreak of the Arrow War in
Guangdong. The British showed no particular interest in Vietnam, so Vietnam was
an appropriate place for the French to focus their attention. It was thought tobe
especially important for the navy to establish a secure base for its Asianoperations,
and Vietnam was admirably located in the center of Eastern Asia.
The secondary consideration was economic. There was a perceived need to
secure stable sources of commodities such as cotton, silk, sugar, rice, and coffee.
Vietnam offered a place accessible by many seaports where a great range of
products could be obtained. Furthermore, it offered opportunities for emerging
French industries to market their manufactured goods.
The final consideration was the religious question, which was pressed upon the
commission by representatives of the missionaries. Ensuring the security of
French missionaries and of Vietnamese Christians was viewed as a moral

argument for intervention that would elicit the approval of the Catholic Church
and would be useful for generating positive public opinion more generally. Louis
Napoleon had cultivated the support of the Church in his rise to power and was
inclined to pose as its protector.
Louis Napoleon endorsed the commission’s recommendation. It happened that
he was in the midst of plans to send an expeditionary force to join the British in an
attack on China to force the revision of treaties that had been signed in the1840s
after the Opium War. Leonard Victor Joseph Charner (1797–1869) commanded
the French naval forces to be engaged in China, and Pierre Louis Charles Rigault de
Genouilly (1807–1873) was in command of one of the divisions of the French fleet.
Rigault de Genouilly had commanded one of the French warships that bombarded
Da Nang in April1847, had served with distinction in the Crimean War, and was a
strong advocate of attacking Vietnam to secure an Asian naval base. His assignment
in 1857 included command of naval operations to be undertaken in Vietnamese
waters.
In late summer of1857, French and Spanish representatives in Macau received
news that in July a Spanish Dominican missionary had been publicly executed in
Nam Dinh, south of Hanoi. Spanish authorities, learning of the prospect for
French action against Vietnam, volunteered to add a contingent of Spanish-led
Filipino troops. By the end of the year, the governments in Paris and Madrid had
agreed on a joint expedition.
After the British and French expedition had forced the Qing government to
sign the Treaties of Tientsin in June1858, Rigault de Genouilly was released
from Charner’s command and directed to rendezvous with a Spanish flotilla off
Hainan Island and to commence operations against Vietnam. On August31 the
Franco-Spanish expedition entered the Bay of Da Nang with fourteen ships,
including five transports. There were around two thousand French troops, many
of them Africans, and five hundred Spanish-led Filipinos; another five hundred
Filipinos eventually arrived from Manila.
The invaders quickly secured the harbor forts and established a beachhead.
Mount Tra, a massif nearly seven hundred meters high, rises on the southeastern
side of the bay. It forms a peninsula attached to the mainland by a narrowstrip of
land. The French placed an observation post on its peak, which enabled them to
observe troop movements throughout the region. Between Mount Tra and the
mouth of the Thu Bon River, thirty kilometers to the south, the hinterland is
crisscrossed with waterways and footpaths. It was in this territory that most of the
fighting between the Vietnamese and the Franco-Spanish forces took place during
the next several months.
The Vietnamese mobilized thousands of soldiers against the invaders but could
not dislodge them. After four months, Tu Duc analyzed the gloomy situation of

his army under six headings. According to him, the enemy was superior to
Vietnamese troops in the gathering of intelligence, in communications, in the
quality of equipment, in mobility, in tactical versatility, and in morale. Tu Duc’s
conclusion, predictably, was to exhort his officials to try harder.
In early1859, Nguyen Tri Phuong arrived in the field and Vietnamese forces
began to record some successes in repulsing enemy attacks. By this time Rigault
de Genouilly had turned his attention away from Quang Nam and was preparing
to strike Saigon. The French commander realized that the initial idea of trying to
reach Hue was futile. There was no plausible way to access Hue directly by sea
and his forces were not sufficient for a major land operation against the large
numbers of Vietnamese soldiers that had been mobilized against him in Quang
Nam.
Missionaries argued for shifting operations to the Red River plain where they
promised the support of a large population of Christians. The Spanish strongly
supported this idea because all of their missionaries were in the north. However,
Rigault de Genouilly had already been disabused of illusory missionary expect-
ations of local people rising up in support of the invaders. Although Tu Duc
attributed the superior intelligence of his enemy to the spying activities of
Vietnamese Christians, Rigault de Genouilly evaluated the information he
received from missionary sources as unreliable. The French commander quar-
reled with the missionaries and turned his back on them. Ignoring the protests of
his Spanish allies, he decided to leave a garrison at Da Nang and with two-thirds
of his men, fewer than two thousand soldiers, seized Saigon in February1859.
Two months later, leaving a garrison at Saigon, Rigault de Genouilly returned
to Da Nang with most of his men. Reinforced by one thousand troops from
France, he endeavored for the next several months to negotiate with the Viet-
namese, but nothing was achieved. In the summer of1860, cholera and typhus
spread among the expeditionary force at Da Nang, particularly among the
reinforcements fresh from France, and the Spanish were increasingly disen-
chanted with the operation. There was no prospect of further reinforcements
because Louis Napoleon had suddenly entered a war against Austria in northern
Italy. This war ended in a matter of weeks but it thoroughly diverted the
emperor’s attention to European affairs and involved complications with Prussia
and Britain. Furthermore, any resources that Paris could spare for Asia were
absorbed by the renewal of hostilities in northern China following Qing dis-
avowal of the Treaties of Tientsin.
A new French expeditionary force arrived in Asia in1860 to operate jointly
with British forces in northern China. In March1860 the Franco-Spanish gar-
rison at Da Nang was terminated. Spanish units returned to Manila and French
units joined the expedition to China. Rigault de Genouilly had returned to

France in October1859 where he argued successfully for the retention of Saigon.
During the summer of1860, while Franco-British forces were engaged in China,
Nguyen Tri Phuong invested Saigon with around twelve thousand Vietnamese
troops, severing it from the outside world. A small Franco-Spanish garrison of
fewer than one thousand men held on, most being Senegalese and Filipino
soldiers. After the conclusion of the Chinese war in late1860, French forces
became available to relieve the Saigon garrison.
In February1861, Admiral Charner arrived in Saigon with reinforcements of
around 2,500 men. During the preceding six months, Nguyen Tri Phuong had
built a large fortress at Ky Hoa designed to prevent the invaders from breaking
out of Saigon. In what became known as the Battle of Ky Hoa, Charner attacked
and demolished this fortress. He then fought through the canal system connect-
ing Cholon with the Mekong and seized My Tho.
In November, Charner was replaced by Louis Adolphe Bonard ( 1805–
1867), whose prior naval career had included action in Tahiti and the gover-
norship of French Guiana in South America. Bonard expanded French-held
territory to include Bien Hoa in December1861 a n dV i n hL o n gi nM a r c h
1862.I nJ u n e1862, a delegation from Hue negotiated the Treaty of Saigon
w i t hh i m ,b yw h i c hT uD u ce n d e dh i sa nti-Christian policy, agreed to pay an
indemnity, and recognized French possession of the three provinces of Bien
Hoa, Gia Dinh, and Dinh Tuong, comprising all of the plain north of the
Mekong River. The small Spanish contingent at Saigon departed for Manila a
year later when the treaty was ratified at Hue; Spanish bitterness over having
gained nothing from the affair soured relations between Paris and Madrid for
several years thereafter.
The leader of the Vietnamese delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Saigon
was Phan Thanh Gian (1796–1867). Of modest ancestry from Vinh Long
Province, he was awarded the doctoral degree in1826, the only man from the
Mekong plain to attain this honor prior to1856. He served as an envoy to the
Qing court in the1830s and became a prominent associate of Truong Dang Que
at Tu Duc’s court in the1850s. In1862, he was the prime spokesman for a realist
appraisal that resistance to the French was hopeless and that diplomacy was the
only feasible path to take.
The Treaty of Saigon became the basis on which subsequent Franco-
Vietnamese relations were contested and expanded. In addition to granting
sovereignty over three provinces to France, it also granted religious freedom to
Catholics. The Hue court had allowed Phan Thanh Gian to negotiate the treaty
under duress, for another Le pretender had appeared in the north at the head of a
serious rebellion. Tu Duc understood that he could not fight the French in the
south and the rebels in the north at the same time.

Formation of French Cochinchina
The inability to pacify the Red River plain and to eradicate the appeal of Le
dynastic pretenders was a great weakness of the Hue monarchy and prevented
concentration of the country’s resources against the French at Saigon. The Le
Duy Cu rebellion of1854–1855 in which Cao Ba Quat had played a part was
followed by a series of rebellions led by men claiming to fight for restoration of
the Le dynasty. There were two main centers of disaffection with the Nguyen
dynasty. One was in the province of Son Tay northwest of Hanoi, adjacent to the
uplands inhabited by people later called Muong, among whom loyalty to the Le
remained strong. The other was along the coast from the Chinese border to the
southernmost estuaries of the Red River south of Nam Dinh, with particular
strength in the old Mac homeland in the region of the modern city of Hai Phong,
which at that time was not yet a city or seaport of significance.
A series of rebellions associated with a Le pretender named Le Duy Minh
emerged from this coastal region from1857 into the 1860s. Although Le Duy
Minh was captured and executed more than once, new Le Duy Minhs continued
to appear, demonstrating that a pattern of insurrection had become institutional-
ized with interchangeable men. The story line of these rebellions held that Le Duy
Minh was aboard a European ship off the coast; he and his generals arrived in
small boats, gathered armies of Christians and Le dynasty enthusiasts from the
peasant population and were assisted by Vietnamese and Chinese pirates whose
boats penetrated deep into the deltaic river system. The first inkling of this story
is dated in Vietnamese records to the autumn of1857. At that time, French naval
craft were poking about the coast seeking information about the death of the
Spanish Dominican missionary who had been executed the previous July. Alien-
ated and lawless elements in the Red River plain apparently combined the old
narrative of restoring the Le with a new narrative of European intervention to
protect the Christians. The Sino-Vietnamese pirate world was quick to join these
narratives as Nguyen dynasty authority receded from the coast.
In 1861 and 1862, just as Charner and Bonard were expanding their grip on
the Saigon region, an especially spectacular outbreak of insurrection led by a Le
Duy Minh occurred in the north. The French identified this Le Duy Minh as
someone they knew by the name of Pierre Le Duy Phung, who in his youth had
been educated at the French missionary school in Penang. He had political
ambitions and as early as1855 had unsuccessfully lobbied the French navy for
assistance in igniting a rebellion against Hue. He accompanied Rigault de
Genouilly’s expedition to Da Nang as an interpreter. When the French shifted
to the south rather than the north, he disappeared. He reappeared as Le Duy

Minh and by late1861 had mobilized an army said to number twenty thousand
men from the coastal provinces of the Red River plain. In early1862 he appealed
to Saigon for aid. The Spanish officers were eager to support him but Bonard said
no and opted instead to accept Hue’s offer to negotiate peace, albeit taking
advantage of the situation in the north to obtain his treaty objectives. Tu Duc
submitted to the Treaty of Saigon just as the rebel army was preparing to attack
Hanoi. He was thereafter able to concentrate enough soldiers against the rebels
to abate the emergency. A year later, in the summer of1863, the Hue court
recorded that Le Duy Minh had fled into the sea but that his followers were still
numerous. Small armies continued to claim adherence to the cause of Le Duy
Minh as late as1867.
Tu Duc was careful to observe the provisions of the Treaty of Saigon. He
withdrew his soldiers and officials from the three provinces ceded to France and
abandoned his anti-Christian policies. Some local resistance to the French
emerged in relatively remote districts south and west of Saigon, but it was
suppressed within a year, and thereafter the newly acquired French territories
were relatively calm. Tu Duc did not encourage anti-French activities, being
occupied with the rebellion in the north and wanting to give no excuse for
further trouble with France. He was nevertheless not reconciled to the loss of
the three southern provinces and, in the spring of1863, shortly after ratifying the
Treaty of Saigon, he sent a delegation led by Phan Thanh Gian to France to
negotiate a new treaty directly with the government at Paris.
Louis Napoleon was then fully occupied with his intervention in Mexico and
showed indications of being tempted by Phan Thanh Gian’s offer of generous
commercial and financial concessions if the three provinces were returned. Phan
Thanh Gian returned to Vietnam in1864 with a draft treaty containing these
provisions, albeit granting to France an enclave at Saigon. Vietnamese hopes
were dashed a year later when word arrived that Louis Napoleon had decided to
retain the1862 treaty.
Meanwhile, Tu Duc was buffeted by indignation among educated Vietnamese
over the Treaty of Saigon, particularly in the north where literati were strongly
anti-Christian and anti-foreign. Details of the treaty spread among the thousands
of men who gathered for the1864 regional examinations. Riots erupted in the
examination yards of Hanoi, Nam Dinh, and Hue. One of Tu Duc’s royal
cousins gathered a large following, including most of the four thousand examin-
ation candidates at Hue, and plotted to unseat Tu Duc, punish Phan Thanh Gian,
and massacre the Christians. This conspiracy was foiled, but outrage continued
unabated.
After the untimely death of Tu Duc’s imprisoned brother, Hong Bao, in1854,
a faction of the royal family continued to view Hong Bao’s lineage as the

legitimate line of succession to the throne. In August of1866, the son-in-law of
one of Tu Duc’s uncles organized an attempt to unseat Tu Duc and to replace
him with Hong Bao’s son. Leaders of this coup attempt accused Tu Duc of being
incapable of resisting the French and of wasting resources on the building of his
own elaborate tomb complex. The conspirators mobilized the workers at the
tomb construction site along with some military units and penetrated into the
royal throne room before being subdued. All members of Hong Bao’s family
were subsequently killed.
During this time, the French at Saigon were led by a senior career naval officer
named Pierre Paul Marie de La Grandière (1807–1876). His governorship, from
October 1863 to April 1868, was the longest of all the naval officers who
presided at Saigon during the 1860s and 1870s, the so-called “era of the
admirals” in the history of French Indochina. La Grandière acted decisively to
stabilize the French position at Saigon and to expand French influence up the
Mekong. Among his initial priorities was to gain a firm grip on the Khmer
monarchy.
When, in1859, the Franco-Spanish expedition seized Saigon and the Vietnam-
ese were concentrating their military resources there, King Ang Duong took the
opportunity to attack Vietnam. His idea, as expressed to French missionaries in
Cambodia, was to ally with France against Vietnam, although the missionaries
did not encourage him in this and the French officers at Saigon ignored him. In
1860, his Khmer and Chinese military units overran Vietnamese border outposts.
He encouraged the Khmer governor of the Vietnamese jurisdiction at Soc Trang,
near the sea just south of the western arm of the Mekong, to rebel, but his army
was unable to force its way downriver to assist this uprising and the Vietnamese
quickly subdued it. When Ang Duong died in December1860, Siam, which did
not want war with France, pressed his son and successor, Norodom, to make
peace.
After the Treaty of Saigon was ratified in1863, Bonard, in one of his last
official acts, obtained from Norodom a treaty of protectorate that contradicted
Cambodia’s existing relationship of vassalage with Siam. During the next four
years, La Grandière orchestrated matters between Saigon, Phnom Penh, Bang-
kok, and Paris to eventually gain the approval of his superiors, the acquiescence
of the Siamese, and the approbation of Norodom to the assertion of French
suzerainty over Cambodia. In1866, he sent an expedition up the Mekong River
to explore the possibilities of using it as a route to China. In1867, he seized the
three remaining Vietnamese provinces in the Mekong plain: Vinh Long, An
Giang, and Ha Tien. Phan Thanh Gian, then serving as governor of these
provinces, deemed resistance to be futile and the annexation was peaceful. The
only notable casualty of the operation was Phan Thanh Gian himself, who

committed suicide in acknowledgment of the failure of his policy of peaceful
negotiation with the French. His death enabled Tu Duc to use him as a scapegoat
for the loss of the south and he was posthumously denounced at Hue.
By 1868, when he returned to France, La Grandière had established the
Colony of Cochinchina and the Protectorate of Cambodia as the foundation
upon which French Indochina would subsequently be built. Plans for building
and administering the City of Saigon were formalized and a cadre of young naval
officers embarked on experiments in administering the indigenous populations,
some of them learning Vietnamese, Chinese, and Khmer. At the same time,
French-speaking Vietnamese graduates of mission schools, local Christians,
and other Vietnamese adapted quickly to French rule and the opportunities it
provided for achieving a range of goals from personal advancement to visions of
a new Vietnam in the modern world. Finally, a non-military colonial population
began to accumulate in Saigon and Cholon, comprised of people mainly from
France but also from other European countries, from India, and from China,
attracted by economic opportunities. Saigon was open for business as an inter-
national seaport and quickly became known for the export of rice.
The Treaty of 1874
During the late1860s and early1870s, Tu Duc, having lost possession of what
had become French Cochinchina in the south, also lost control over the upland
hinterland of the Red River plain, while his authority in the lowlands shrank to a
few garrisoned administrative centers, primarily Hanoi, Son Tay, Bac Ninh, Hai
Duong, Hon Gai, Nam Dinh, and Ninh Binh. Adding to the long-term trend of
increasing insubordination and insurrection that characterized Tu Duc’s entire
reign was the turmoil and disaffection among officialdom produced by Tu Duc’s
effort to end his anti-Christian policy in accordance with the Treaty of Saigon.
Anti-Christian sentiment was strong in officialdom and Christians were vulner-
able targets for anger over loss of the south. Tu Duc’s efforts to avoid further
complications with the French by enforcing religious provisions of the treaty led
to a diminution of respect for him among local officials who viewed Christians as
French partisans. The exam riots of1864 and the coup attempt of1866 were but
the most visible demonstrations of growing dissatisfaction with his leadership. In
1866and again in1868, Tu Duc disciplined officials in Nghe An and Ha Tinh
for their anti-Christian activities. Similar but less publicized episodes of punish-
ing officials and calming tensions between Christians and local officials occurred
with increasing frequency in the Red River plain.

Meanwhile, the leaders of upland peoples in the northern mountains slipped
out of Hue’s control. Many of them allied with private Chinese armies that
crossed the border from Guangxi. The most important of these armies was led
by Liu Yongfu (1837–1917), a Hakka Chinese from Guangxi who grew up in
poverty and came of age in the1850s when the Taiping Rebellion erupted in
Guangxi and spread north into the Yangtze River basin. He joined elements of
the rebel movement that remained in Guangxi and rose to a position of leader-
ship. After the death of the Taiping leader in1864, Qing forces gradually
reasserted their control over the territories held by insurgents, and some local
strongmen in the south led their followers across the Sino-Vietnamese border to
seek their fortunes in the uplands of northern Vietnam, where opium and
precious metals were produced. Most of these men rallied under the yellow flags
of Huang Chungying (d.1876). Huang Chungying allied himself with the
chieftains of the upland minority peoples and established a reputation for being
in defiance of both Qing and Hue authorities.
Liu Yongfu’s army, flying black flags, was smaller but more disciplined than
the yellow flag army. He impressed Vietnamese officials by defeating an array of
rebellious local chieftains and obtained a commission from Hue to pacify the
uplands. In1868, he expelled Huang Chungying from Lao Cai, on the Red River
at the Yunnan border. The Qing general sent at the request of Hue to subdue the
yellow flag army was impressed by this, and Liu Yongfu subsequently received a
Qing commission to assist in suppressing Huang Chungying. Huang Chungying
was eventually defeated and killed by a combined Sino-Vietnamese operation in
which Liu Yongfu played a prominent part during1875–1876. Meanwhile, Liu
Yongfu, based at Lao Cai, gained control of the lucrative commerce on the Red
River between Yunnan and Hanoi. In the late1870s, he established a secondary
base of operations at Hung Hoa to protect the Red River from remnants of the
yellow flag forces who had moved west into Laos as well as from the red and
striped banner forces comprised of rebels in Yunnan that shifted into northern
Laos after being defeated by Qing armies.
In the early1870s, a French merchant adventurer named Jean Dupuis (1829–
1912) appeared in the midst of the relatively lawless situation in northern
Vietnam and provoked an episode that demonstrated the impotence of the Hue
court and revealed contradictions between French authorities in Saigon and the
new republican government in Paris. Dupuis had gone to China in1861 to seek
his fortune in trade. In 1868 he met members of the French Mekong River
expedition as they made their way from the upper Mekong in Yunnan to the
coast at Shanghai. From them he learned of the likelihood that the Red River was
navigable from Yunnan to the sea. In1869, he traveled to Yunnan and took
orders for an arms shipment from the Qing officials then engaged in fighting a

rebellion in that province. In1871, he revisited Yunnan and reconnoitered part-
way down the Red River to verify that it was navigable all the way to the
lowlands.
At the beginning of1872, he was in Paris. Although the new Third Republic
government was just emerging from the disorders of the Franco-Prussian War
and the suppression of the Communards, he obtained permission from the
Ministry of War to purchase a consignment of arms to sell to China. Also, the
Ministry of the Navy promised to send a letter to Cochinchina authorizing
assistance to facilitate his travel from Saigon to Hue in order to obtain Vietnam-
ese approval to traverse the Red River. He was soon back in Asia where in Hong
Kong he assembled a small flotilla and a force of around175 men, twenty-five of
them Europeans and the rest Asian, mostly Chinese. When the arms shipment
arrived from Europe, he went to Saigon where a letter from Paris on his behalf
was waiting. The governor was absent, but the presiding official passed him to a
naval captain about to depart on a survey of the Vietnamese coast. The captain
advised Dupuis to forget about going to Hue, for, in his view, dealing with the
officials at the Vietnamese court was nothing but an aggravating waste of time.
He advised Dupuis to simply take his shipment up the Red River, assuring him
that Vietnamese authorities would not be able to stop him. Dupuis took this
advice and hastened back to Hong Kong. A few weeks later he and his flotilla
rendezvoused with the captain who showed him how to get into the Red River
from the sea. In December, he arrived at Hanoi.
Vietnamese authorities were taken aback by the appearance of this small but
well-armed force and could not prevent Dupuis from fortifying a district in
Hanoi with the support of the Chinese merchant community. Leaving most of
his men at Hanoi, Dupuis proceeding upriver with part of his cargo. He arrived
in Yunnan, delivered his merchandise, and was back in Hanoi by April with a
shipment of precious metals along with150 Qing soldiers provided by the
governor of Yunnan. He was arranging to return to Yunnan with a shipment
of salt when Nguyen Tri Phuong arrived to take charge of the situation in Hanoi.
Nguyen Tri Phuong stiffened the resistance of Vietnamese officials to Dupuis’
seemingly uncontrollable activities. Dupuis set himself in defiance of the Viet-
namese government, and a state of hostilities ensued between him and Nguyen
Tri Phuong. Tu Duc sent an appeal to Saigon, complaining that Dupuis was
lawlessly violating existing agreements.
Marie Jules Dupré (1813–1881) was the governor at Saigon from1871 to
1874. He was a career naval officer who had participated in the earliest phase of
French operations at Saigon and was an ardent exponent of expanding French
control over all of Vietnam. At the same time, he was under strict instructions
from the government in Paris to avoid any expansion of French involvement in

Vietnamese affairs. The government of the Third Republic, still suffering the
effects of defeat by Prussia and of the ensuing civil war in the streets of Paris, had
no appetite for new colonial adventures. Dupré was caught between his instruc-
tions and his personal inclinations. Not wanting to ruin his career by being
insubordinate, he sent a message to Dupuis instructing him to submit to the
Vietnamese authorities. Dupuis cleverly replied that if the French did not seize
the Red River route to China then the British, or the Germans, or even the
Chinese would move in. The prospect of this so frightened Dupré that he sent
money to sustain Dupuis and decided to depute someone he could trust to sort
out the confrontation in Hanoi. He turned to a young naval officer named Marie
Joseph François Garnier (1839–1873).
Garnier had been on the staff of Admiral Charner and had subsequently served as
the administrator of Cholon under Bonard and La Grandière. It was at Garnier’s
urging that the Mekong expedition was initiated in1866. He was a member of the
expedition and assumed command of it when the leader died in Yunnan. His
outstanding qualities of leadership, despite his youth, were demonstrated in bring-
ing the expedition out through China from Yunnan via the Yangtze River. His
encounter with Dupuis at that time alerted Dupuis to the idea of opening trade with
Yunnan on the Red River. Garnier returned to France and fought in the Franco-
Prussian War. In the summer of1873, he was honeymooning in China when he
received an urgent summons from Dupré. He arrived in Saigon in August and, after
conferring with Dupré, was soon on his way to Hanoi with170 men. What passed
between Dupré and Garnier is not exactly clear, but presumably they entertained
expectations similar to those expressed by the captain who had advised Dupuisand
guided him into the Red River the previous year. A common opinion among the
French in Cochinchina was that the Vietnamese were incapable of any serious
resistance. As for Paris, Dupré apparently gambled that the attitude of the metro-
politan government could be moved by a fait accompli.
Tu Duc and Nguyen Tri Phuong imagined that Garnier had arrived to escort
Dupuis out of the country by force. Instead, Garnier allied with Dupuis and
began to issue commands contradicting the public announcements of Nguyen Tri
Phuong. Events moved quickly to a military confrontation. In addition to the few
French troops who had arrived with Garnier, Dupuis had about500 men under
arms with up-to-date weapons, including the150 Qing soldiers from Yunnan as
well as men he recruited from the local Chinese community and deserters from
the Qing army that had entered the country from Guangxi to suppress the yellow
banner forces. In the Hanoi citadel, Nguyen Tri Phuong had around seven
thousand soldiers, but their weapons were outdated. In late November, Garnier
attacked the citadel and it quickly fell. Nguyen Tri Phuong was wounded
and died.

During the next three weeks, Garnier’s men raced on river steamboats from
one place to another and easily took possession of nearly all the Vietnamese
administrative centers in the Red River plain between Hanoi and the sea.
Although the Spanish missionaries held aloof, most French missionaries cooper-
ated with Garnier, and many Vietnamese Christians assisted the French with
supply and reconnaissance, as auxiliary militia, and in setting up local adminis-
trations. While French missionaries and Vietnamese Christians were prominent
in assisting Garnier, they constituted a relatively small minority of the Vietnam-
ese who rallied in support of the invaders. The reservoir of dissidents who had
provided manpower to the series of Le pretenders in previous years also
responded to Garnier.
Hoang Ta Viem (1820–1909), the husband of one of Minh Mang’s daughters,
was in command of the Vietnamese fortress at Son Tay, about forty kilometers
upriver from Hanoi. Another senior Vietnamese official in the region was Ton
That Thuyet (1839–1913), a descendent of the seventeenth-century ruler Nguyen
Phuc Tan, who was rising to the top echelon of influence at Tu Duc’s court.
These two men called upon Liu Yongfu for help. Hoang Ta Viem had previously
established a close and friendly relationship with Liu Yongfu. Liu Yongfu moved
his men downriver and was in the vicinity of Hanoi by mid December. The
yellow flag forces, not yet subdued, were inclined to support the French against
the black flags, but were too slow to have any effect on the situation. Considering
that the black flag soldiers were his most serious adversaries, Garnier was
determined to demonstrate his mastery over them at the earliest opportunity.
When they appeared at the western gates of Hanoi, Garnier impetuously led a
sally against them, but was ambushed and killed.
Saigon had just been linked to Paris by undersea cable, and news of Garnier’s
activities quickly reached men in the metropolitan government and they directed
Dupré to put an end to the affair. Dupré’s gamble had failed. There was no way
for him to temporize, to let events take their course, to wait for the surface mails
to shuttle across the seas, giving time for a fait accompli to gain momentum. His
instructions from Paris to stop Garnier were unmistakable and promised disgrace
if he did not immediately comply. He turned to a young naval officer and
colonial administrator with a reputation as a serious scholar of Vietnamese
culture, Paul Louis Felix Philastre (1837–1902).
Philastre had arrived in Vietnam with Charner in1861. He was soon fluent in
Vietnamese and learned to read Chinese characters. Dupré sent him north with
authority to terminate the French adventure on the Red River. He arrived in
Hanoi shortly after Garnier’s death and moved quickly to restore Tu Duc’s
officials to their posts and to redeploy the French soldiers back to Cochinchina.
He sent Dupuis packing with a strong rebuke. A new agreement was

subsequently negotiated, known as the Treaty of1874, which superseded the
1862 Treaty of Saigon.
The Treaty of1874 appeared to stabilize and deepen the Franco-Vietnamese
relationship, but in fact it became a source of misunderstanding and frustration
to both sides. The Vietnamese obtained the French evacuation of the north,
which was Tu Duc’s main concern. For their part, the French obtained formal
Vietnamese acknowledgment of their 1867 annexation of the three western
provinces of Cochinchina, which Hue had previously refused to grant. The
freedom of missionaries and the protection of Christians were guaranteed.
Although some local magistrates countenanced a wave of reprisals against the
Christians who had supported Garnier’s brief conquest in the north, Tu Duc
discouraged this because he wanted to provide no excuse for the return of French
soldiers. The most serious anti-Christian activities occurred not in the Red River
plain but in Nghe An and Ha Tinh, where a large Christian population had
existed since the early seventeenth century and where the Confucian-educated
literati were particularly anti-Christian and anti-French. Ton That Thuyet was
eventually sent to calm those two provinces.
Post-treaty disorder in the north
With the Treaty of1874, the French appeared to have gained what Dupuis had
initially sought. Treaty provisions opened the Red River, as well as the ports of
Qui Nhon, Hanoi, and Hai Phong, to international commerce. French consuls
were to be stationed in these ports with judicial prerogatives over any litigation
involving Europeans and with the authority to issue travel passes to Europeans,
countersigned by Vietnamese officials. Joint Franco-Vietnamese customs houses
were to be set up in these ports and were governed by arrangements specified in a
commercial treaty concluded a few months later. These commercial aspects of
the treaty were never implemented to the satisfaction of either party. On the Red
River between Son Tay and Lao Cai, after expulsion of the yellow flags in1875,
Liu Yongfu was in control and levied substantial fees without regard for any
other authority, whether Vietnamese, Chinese, or French. There was relatively
little commercial activity in Hanoi or Qui Nhon.
Hai Phong, however, was a different matter. Hai Phong did not exist as a place
of any significance until this time. It was situated to control access into the Red
River plain from the sea, and it had the added advantage of being located near
the coal mines of Hon Gai. Within six months of Hai Phong being opened to
trade under the new treaty, the population of Chinese there increased from zero
to six thousand. Soon there was a regular steamship service between Hong Kong

and Hai Phong. Rice and coal began to flow out of the new port. The excessive
export of rice led to a steep rise in its price and to famine conditions in the
hinterland. Vietnamese officials did not know how to administer the burgeoning
port city and could not control the activities of Chinese merchants. They wanted
to fix the price of rice and to limit its export. The French wanted an open market.
Mutual aggravation ensued.
More serious than this were the1874 treaty provisions on diplomatic and
military matters. The French deemed that they had obtained the equivalent of a
protectorate over Vietnam with a resident chargé d’affaires at Hue and articles
asserting that Vietnam did not recognize the suzerainty of any third country and
that Vietnam would subordinate its foreign policy to French supervision. The
French believed that this ended Qing sovereignty over Vietnam and were indig-
nant when Vietnam continued to send regular tribute missions to China and to
rely on Qing assistance against the yellow flags. The French were inclined to view
this as violating an article in the treaty specifying that, in case of internal
disorder, Vietnam would call upon France for assistance. Some Frenchmen were
exercised about the suppression of the yellow flags by joint Sino-Vietnamese
operations in1875 and 1876 because they viewed the yellow flags as a potential
pro-French force. When a man claiming to be a descendent of the Ly dynasty of
the eleventh and twelfth centuries came across the Sino-Vietnamese border in
1877with an army of several thousand, some French were incensed when Tu
Duc called upon the Qing rather than the French for help. In1879, Qing forces
captured the pretender and carried him back to China for execution.
Also troubling to many of the French was that the British interpreted the
Treaty of 1874 as implying in principle the residence of consuls from other
countries in the Vietnamese port cities, and that these consuls would have
jurisdiction over judicial affairs concerning their people, thus dismissing French
pretensions of having an exclusive relationship with the Vietnamese court as its
protector. The French were concerned to make good their control of Vietnam
before other countries could enter the situation. For his part, Tu Duc still
dreamed of negotiating the withdrawal of the French and, in1878, used the
occasion of sending a delegation to an international exposition in France for a
vain attempt to reopen the matter with Paris. A Vietnamese diplomatic mission
to Siam was thwarted when the Siamese, fearing the French, refused to receive it.
Not so timorous were the Spanish, who in1880 negotiated a commercial treaty
with Hue, raising French apprehensions that the British and Germans would not
be far behind. Frustration with the state of Franco-Vietnamese affairs in the late
1870s was mostly confined to a group of Frenchmen in Cochinchina and their
friends in Paris who were committed to colonial expansion for reasons of
commerce and of competition with other imperial powers. The Paris government

at this time was absorbed in domestic politics and gave little attention to the
provisions of the Treaty of1874. The admirals governing at Saigon during this
time, stung by the Garnier affair, were loath to go down that road again. They
professed contentment with Cochinchina and Cambodia and saw nothing in the
north but an ungovernable headache.
Local administration in many parts of the Red River plain never returned to a
semblance of normal government after the Garnier affair. Hunger and banditry
spread as village notables and wealthy families changed communal land into
private land to enable them to participate in the export market for rice. Tu Duc
attempted to enact a tax reform to obtain more revenue from privately held land
but achieved little more than to further alienate influential men in the north. He
initiated a plan to organize landless peasants into militia units and to settle them
on vacant land in upland valleys. He wanted to increase the number of soldiers
available to suppress bandits and to relieve the pressure on royal troops, but the
effect of this, to the extent that it was implemented, was to increase the control of
local officials over military resources. Tu Duc’s efforts to govern the north were
increasingly disconnected from the situation existing there. Vietnamese and
Chinese pirates on the coasts and along the major rivers operated with impunity.
They specialized in capturing women and children to sell into slavery in China.
French coastal vessels were assigned to intercept them, and in1877 the Hue
court even proposed that France establish a fortress on Cat Ba Island, near Hai
Phong, to suppress the slave trade, which was centered there. In conditions of
increasing lawlessness, local communities, particularly those comprised of
Christians under the leadership of missionaries, organized for self-defense.
French administration in rural Cochinchina
Meanwhile, the situation in Cochinchina was developing very differently. Viet-
namese administrators had abandoned the Mekong provinces, leaving the task of
government completely in the hands of the French. A brief flurry of resistance to
the French broke out after the Battle of Ky Hoa in early1861, but faded away in
1863 when the Hue court ratified the Treaty of Saigon. The most famous leader
of this resistance was Truong Dinh (1820–1864), a military officer who estab-
lished his main base at Go Cong, about forty kilometers south of Saigon. French
pacification operations were increasingly effective, and, in early1864, Truong
Dinh took his own life when he was betrayed and ambushed. Truong Dinh’s
reputation as an enemy of the French invaders was partly a result of him being
celebrated in the writings of Nguyen Dinh Chieu (1822–1888), a blind scholar

from the Saigon area who settled in Ben Tre, about seventy kilometers south of
Saigon, where he wrote anti-French and anti-Christian poetry until his death.
The pattern of rural resistance to established authority that subsequently
developed in Cochinchina pre-dated the French. It emerged from the cultural
mix of Khmer, Chinese, and Vietnamese in the western provinces. Government
had always been weak or non-existent in this remote region. The inhabitants
typically sought to distance themselves from authority. There were few people
who could read or write. Village organization was rudimentary at best. Family
bonds were tenuous. Since the seventeenth century, armies of Khmers, Vietnam-
ese, Siamese, and Chinese had passed through, sometimes without serious effect,
sometimes giving a certain temporary ascendancy to one group or another, and
sometimes with destruction and grief in their wakes. In the late eighteenth
century, Nguyen Phuc Anh endeavored to stabilize the region by enforcing
separation between the various groups and appointing Chinese, Khmers, and
Vietnamese to each govern their own people. The building of the Vinh Te Canal
between Ha Tien and Chau Doc in the1820s superficially made a geographical
border but it also created a venue for even greater contact among the various
peoples.
Minh Mang’s policy of ethnic assimilation removed administrative barriers
between the different peoples. This was intended to Vietnamize the non-
Vietnamese, but here, where the Vietnamese were not a majority, it led to strong
Khmer and Chinese influence upon the Vietnamese. Le Van Khoi’s rebellion and
the subsequent wars involving Cambodia and Siam further destabilized govern-
ment administration. The Lam Sam rebellion in the early1840s rallied members
of all three ethnic groups behind a man claiming religious rather than secular
authority. When warfare ended in the late1840s, ideas and practices from
Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, Daoist spiritualism, popular religious
cults, secret societies, and the prowess of magicians, healers, sorcerers, diviners,
and geomancers combined with millenarian expectations, creating a current of
religious thought and action that continued through the twentieth century,
periodically mobilized by charismatic personalities.
Remnants of the Lam Sam movement took refuge in the Seven Mountains
(That Son) between Ha Tien and Chau Doc, just south of the Vinh Te Canal,
which popular belief identified as a gateway to Heaven where deities appeared.
Generations of religious leaders and their disciples have resided in these moun-
tains to the present day. In times of social stress, healers believed to possess divine
powers went through the region attracting followers. One such person appeared
during the cholera epidemic of1849. Arrested by Vietnamese authorities, he was
forced to enter a traditional Buddhist monastery where he could be supervised.
But his charisma overcame all who would restrain him and he soon went to the

Seven Mountains beyond the reach of government. Although he died shortly
after, from among his followers there periodically appeared men who stimulated
new episodes of millenarian enthusiasm that were directed toward the supernat-
ural world and consequently did not acknowledge earthly authorities, whether
Vietnamese magistrates or French administrators. Beginning in the late1860s,
those inclined to resist the French tended to join this reservoir of belief beyond
secular law, from which they occasionally emerged in uprisings that were easily
suppressed by the French. Being on the Cambodian border, these uprisings were
sometimes related to similar movements among Khmers rebelling against author-
ities in Phnom Penh.
The enduring appeal of millenarian healers and magicians in Cochinchina was
also related to two features of southern Vietnamese society that have been
attributed by historians to the effects of French colonialism but that in fact pre-
dated the French. These are the relative weakness of village organization and the
relative significance of a mobile landless population. Without the economic
security of land or the social security of a village community, religious figures
offered the promise of salvation and the comfort of mutual care in their entou-
rages. Combined with European cultural influences felt during French colonial
rule, these conditions eventually gave rise to new religions in the twentieth
century.
From the very beginning of organized Vietnamese penetration into the
Mekong plain, landless peasants working as virtual slaves for large landowners
were a salient feature of Vietnamese settlement. As noted in a previous chapter,
in1711 Nguyen Phuc Chu admonished his officials at Saigon to stop enslaving
peasants and to allocate land to them. The recording of such an event is typically
an indication of a chronic condition rather than of a problem being solved.
Efforts to mitigate the status of landless peasants are most evident in instructions
to organize military colonies, in which case peasants were still in a disciplined
structure of authority. Since land was plentiful, peasants who wanted to avoid
serving a landlord or a military officer simply moved further south or west,
giving rise to the pattern of large organized landholdings in the east where
government authority was strongest, and a more miscellaneous situation among
the Chinese, Khmer, and Vietnamese peasants of western Cochinchina, which
was less developed economically and administratively.
One effect of French rule was to expand the regime of large estates into
western Cochinchina in order to increase the export of rice, which produced
more landless peasants. Village organizations were generally controlled by those
with the most wealth, typically landlords, and they provided no plausible remedy
for landlessness. French administrators in Cochinchina repeatedly commented
upon the large population of landless peasants who marketed their labor, and

they assumed that this was a result of their own policies. Some of the French were
dismayed by the phenomenon while others considered it an inevitable phase in
the necessary shift of Vietnamese society from village communalism toward
individual freedom and responsibility.
French policy toward village government was to shift authority away from the
group of wealthy and educated elders called notables, and to put it into the hands
of someone they identified as the“mayor.” In the past, this person was the
representative of the notables, usually a younger man, chosen by them to imple-
ment their decisions. But the French considered him to be an equivalent of the
mayor of a French town who represented the central government rather than the
village. The French believed that the notables were primarily motivated to
maintain their own economic advantages and that they could not be trusted to
serve in a scheme of authority controlled by colonial administrators. Since many
notables and those who spoke on their behalf supported the French regime, the
status of the village notables became a controversial issue. The French were
reluctant to cede administrative authority into the hands of men already estab-
lished in positions of importance in local society for fear of not being able to
exercise their authority unimpeded by local self-interest. Rather, they relied upon
younger, less established, men to serve as village leaders. These men were
expected to be more dependent upon the French than the village notables could
be. However, as they received no salary and often had to use their own funds to
carry out their duties, it was often difficult to find qualified men willing to serve
in this position. The result was a general weakening of village government as the
notables were disengaged from local decision-making and administrative author-
ity was vested in men with relatively little influence in local society and with little
incentive to perform their duties.
The collection of revenue did not at this time change dramatically from prior
practice, except that it was collected more efficiently than in pre-French times.
Eventually, in the1880s, taxation would be changed from a collective village
responsibility to the individual responsibility of each taxpayer. Not until the turn
of the century would the French initiate the elaborate tax regime that became
characteristic of their rule.
Law and language in Cochinchina
The French naval authorities in Cochinchina were perplexed most of all by
efforts to administer justice. The pre-French legal system had been administered
by magistrates with a relatively high level of educational achievement in the
system of examinations used by the Hue court to staff officialdom. These men

were not only conversant with the law code published by the founder of the
dynasty in1812 but also with the edicts, sub-statutes, and precedents that had
developed around it and that made it practicable. With the arrival of the French,
these men departed for the north. No one remained in French Cochinchina with
the knowledge and experience necessary to apply the law.
The naval officers in Saigon initially decided to translate the Vietnamese law
code into French, imagining that this would allow them to practice law in the
manner to which the people were accustomed. An officer named Louis Gabriel
Galderec Aubaret (1825–1894) was one of the first Frenchmen in Saigon to gain
fluency in Vietnamese and the ability to read Chinese characters. His perception
of the great gulf separating Vietnamese and French culture led him to believe that
any effort by Frenchmen to govern Vietnamese was doomed to fail. Conse-
quently, he had assisted Phan Thanh Gian on his trip to Paris in1863 and helped
to draft the treaty, never ratified, that provided for returning the hinterland of
Saigon to the Vietnamese. He completed a translation of the law code in1865,
but, for one thing, the associated edicts and statutes were missing and, for
another thing, unlike French law that specified all conceivable cases in some
detail, this code was oriented toward general principles to be applied as deemed
appropriate in individual cases by judges with years of local experience. The
application of Vietnamese law depended more upon the discretion of magistrates
than upon the letter of the law.
French administrators could make little sense of Aubaret’s translation. The
alternative was to simply apply French law, but Philastre, who terminated the
Garnier affair in1873, believed that rulers should learn the culture of the people
they governed rather than vice versa. He argued the need for a more detailed
translation of the Vietnamese law code and accordingly received authorization to
produce it. Completed in1875, Philastre’s translation was erudite, meticulous,
and included sub-statutes as well as Ming and Qing commentaries. Unfortu-
nately, it would have taken a scholar to make use of it, and it proved to be no
more practicable than Aubaret’s translation had been. Meanwhile, the admirals
experimented for two decades with various measures for administering justice
until French law was extended to Cochinchina after the appointment of its first
civilian governor in1879.
Men like Aubaret and Philastre were disturbed by how young French officers
with no Vietnamese language ability or knowledge of Vietnamese culture were
governing Cochinchina through a cadre of Vietnamese translators of very uneven
quality. One of their like-minded colleagues, Jean Baptiste Eliacin Luro (1837–
1877), obtained authorization to open a school for trainees to give new arrivals
from France an introduction to Cochinchinese administration. He designed a
curriculum that included Vietnamese language, Chinese characters, and

introductions to Vietnamese culture, society, and government. The school oper-
ated from1874 to 1878. Most Frenchmen considered the workload to be
excessive, and the school was closed after Luro’s death from illness. Aubaret,
Philastre, and Luro were the most prominent of the naval officers serving in the
first generation of French administration in Cochinchina who learned to respect
Vietnamese culture. Men with similar views were an influential, and occasionally
dominant, minority in subsequent generations of colonial administration in
Indochina.
Some Vietnamese translators were poorly educated or more interested in
personal advancement than in government service. Yet, there were many other
Vietnamese, both Christians and non-Christians, who accepted French rule as
the way for their country to enter the new global realm of advanced technology.
They served not only as translators but also as journalists, scholars, adminis-
trators, and soldiers. One of the most famous of these was Petrus Truong Vinh
Ky (1837–1898), a Christian from Ben Tre in Vinh Long Province who studied
both Chinese and Latin in his youth. He attended mission schools in Phnom Penh
(1848–1851) and Penang (1851–1858), learning French and training to be a
priest. The death of his mother brought him back to Vietnam just as the French
invasion was beginning. In1860 he sought refuge with the French in Saigon from
anti-Christian activists. He married the following year, and in1862 he was
teaching in a school for translators. In1863 he accompanied Phan Thanh Gian
to France as an interpreter and took the opportunity to also visit Spain, Portugal,
and Italy. He became a tireless advocate of Quoc Ngu, the Vietnamese alphabet.
He was involved in beginning the publication of the first Quoc Ngu newspaper in
1865, Gia Dinh Bao, and within a few years was serving as its editor. He headed
the school for translators in the late1860s and in1871 became the principal of a
school for teachers. He taught Vietnamese and Chinese in Luro’s school for
trainees in the mid1870s and served French administrators in various capacities
during the 1870s and 1880s. His greatest contribution, however, was in the
development of Quoc Ngu from a relatively rudimentary tool for transcription
into a means for writing the contemporary spoken vernacular. He translated
many works from Chinese and Vietnamese character writing (Han and Nom)
into Quoc Ngu. He believed that Vietnamese could fully express their experience
of the world in vernacular writing; he wrote and published many works in Quoc
Ngu, not only about history, literature, and morality but also about grammar
and pedagogy.
Paulus Huynh Tinh Cua (1834–1907) was another man who contributed to
the development of Quoc Ngu. He was from Ba Ria, on the coast east of Saigon.
He joined French service in1861 and, like Truong Vinh Ky, went to France with
Phan Thanh Gian and was an editor ofGia Dinh Bao. He was a prolific writer

and produced a large body of articles and essays in the vernacular. Truong Vinh
Ky and Huynh Tinh Cua were but the two most prominent among a large
number of Vietnamese in Saigon who were dedicated to vernacular writing and
whose works became the basis for the great awakening that occurred in the early
twentieth century of Vietnamese thought about the modern world.
The naval officers who governed Cochinchina in the1860s and 1870s were
determined to eradicate the use of character writing, which they considered to
represent all the backward attachments to China that impeded their aim of
bringing progress to the Vietnamese. Although they were unable to completely
dispense with character writing for many years because of the degree to which it
was ingrained in the minds of educated Vietnamese, they strove to educate a new
generation of students in the Vietnamese alphabet and in French. In the1860s
there were false starts, including an unsuccessful program to send teenage Viet-
namese boys to Catholic schools in France. In the1870s, a system of provincial
primary schools in Quoc Ngu and in French was established with a secondary
school at Saigon in French. Educational policy provoked prolonged controver-
sies over language, with some arguing that only French should be allowed and
that Quoc Ngu should be discouraged because it was a potential language of
resistance to French. Others argued that you could not eradicate the vernacular
language and that Quoc Ngu should be used as an alphabetic step for students
into French.
Behind this difference of opinion lay a larger theoretical issue in the minds of
French colonialists, commonly referred to as a choice between assimilation,
turning Vietnam into an Asiatic France, and association, nurturing a version of
Vietnamese culture that could be associated with the French endeavor to bring
Vietnam into the modern world. In the jargon of the time, the French called this
task a“civilizing mission.” However, they did not understand this in the way of
more recent generations as expressing the idea that the Vietnamese were not
civilized. Most French administrators who accumulated years of experience
among the Vietnamese and who learned to speak Vietnamese had no doubt
but that the Vietnamese were already a civilized people with their own history,
literature, philosophies, religions, and patterns for organizing families, commu-
nities, and government. What the“civilizing mission” meant for them was to
teach the Vietnamese how to enjoy the benefits of up-to-date technology, medical
science, modern industrial and agricultural production, communications, trans-
portation, and the liberation of individual creativity from the stifling hand of
dead tradition. This idealistic task was often corrupted by arrogance, racism, and
greed, but French colonial rule cannot be judged as more virulent and corrupt
than the regimes that had governed the Vietnamese in earlier ages. It was based,
as all regimes in the past had been, upon the power to coerce and the corruptions

of human nature. But it was also based upon the ideal of helping the Vietnamese
to overcome the backwardness that had enabled the French invaders to prevail.
The rhetoric of assimilation and association went through several phases of
debate and understanding in French colonial thought, but would not have any
discernible significance for Vietnamese until the second decade of the twentieth
century when the French began to take into account the Vietnamese response to
the colonial relationship. The contradiction between assimilation and association
continued to the very end of the French efforts to maintain their ascendancy over
the Vietnamese. This was also the contradiction found in French politics and
government in France between the urge to enforce centralized uniformity and the
appreciation for distinctive characteristics of regional identities.
In general, Cochinchina in the1860s and 1870s enjoyed relative peace and
security. Although French administration was in a process of adaptation to local
conditions, it nevertheless provided a measure of calm and prosperity in great
contrast to the disturbed conditions in the Red River plain. The export of rice
from Cochinchina rose from around50,000 tons annually in the early1860st o
320,000 tons annually by1877. Land grants designed to increase rice production
led to the growth of the landlord class but at the same time provided employment
for peasants. Cochinchina became the only part of Vietnam to be ruled as a direct
colony subject to French law. Its economy was organized toward the inter-
national seaport of Saigon-Cholon where entrepreneurial ambitions and a
cosmopolitan urban culture grew. The quarter-century of subordination to
Hue, from the suppression of Le Van Khoi to the French invasion, was anomal-
ous in the history of Saigon. Life in southern Vietnam under the French resonated
with the earlier era of power and prosperity in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries under Nguyen Phuc Anh/Gia Long and Le Van Duyet.
Southern Vietnamese were part of the wider world while Vietnamese in the north
suffered the effects of isolation, poverty, insecurity, and governmental
breakdown.
The Sino-French War
By the end of the1870s, the number of Frenchmen, both in Cochinchina and in
France, who had given up on hopes of establishing a working relationship with
Tu Duc was growing rapidly. Furthermore, the lack of effective authority in the
north aroused French fears of intervention by China or by another European
power. Advocates of colonial expansion were determined to establish French
control over the Red River route to Yunnan. But any new French initiative would
require the full support of Paris. Such support began to develop in the late1870s

as new industrial, commercial, and colonial interests began to be felt in parlia-
ment after the monarchists were defeated in1877. The resistance of the naval
officers in Saigon to these new interests, which they believed would push aside
their priorities, led in1879 to the appointment of the first civilian governor of
Cochinchina, Charles Le Myre de Vilers (1833–1918).
The rise of republican politicians in parliament at this time produced a major
shift in French policy toward colonial expansion in Vietnam. Their anti-
clericalism, partly derived from the Church’s support of monarchy, made them
uninterested in and sometimes hostile to the missionaries. But they wanted to
restore France as a great European power and believed that the acquisition of a
colonial empire would go far toward erasing the humiliating defeat in the
Prussian War of1870–1871. There were, however, two major tendencies among
the republicans. The Radical Republicans supported colonial expansion so long
as it did not interfere with their agenda of major domestic reforms. The Oppor-
tunist Republicans were less ideologically committed to effecting social change
and were more interested in international affairs. They favored gradualist domes-
tic policies that seized opportunities for, but did not force, reform. They were
also more susceptible to seizing opportunities for colonial expansion. Such an
opportunity presented itself in Vietnam.
Major figures among the Opportunist Republicans served as prime ministers
during the early1880s when the decisions were made that pushed forward the
conquest of Vietnam: Léon Gambetta (1838–1882), Charles Louis de Saulces de
Freycinet (1828–1923), and Jules François Camille Ferry (1832–1893). Gam-
betta was closely associated with the deputy representing Cochinchina in Par-
liament, Jules Blancsubé, who was also the Mayor of Saigon and an advocate of
taking northern Vietnam. These men were at the forefront of a growing chorus
of politicians, government officials, businessmen, geographical societies, cham-
bers of commerce, and propagandists such as Jean Dupuis, the merchant
adventurer who had been expelled from Hanoi by the navy in1874. One firm
proponent of action in Vietnam was Jean Bernard Jauréguiberry (1815–1887),
a distinguished admiral who as a captain had led the first French landing at
Saigon in1859. In the autumn of 1879, as Minister of the Navy and of
Colonies, he proposed that a large expeditionary force be sent to northern
Vietnam. This plan was too ambitious at that time and it languished. But the
idea remained alive, and, in early1882, Le Myre de Vilers was authorized to
send a military detachment to Hanoi for the purpose of opening up the Red
River to commerce. In effect, the first step in the new French policy was to
challenge Liu Yongfu.
Le Myre de Vilers turned to Henri Laurent Rivière (1827–1883), a career
naval officer with literary ambitions who had been recently posted to Saigon as

commander of the Cochinchina naval division. When Rivière seized Hanoi
citadel with around five hundred men in April1882, China mobilized an army
across the Sino-Vietnamese border. The French minister to China was so alarmed
that he negotiated an agreement for a Sino-French partition of northern Vietnam.
There followed nearly a year of inaction as Le Myre de Vilers shrank from
confrontation with China, Rivière sat in Hanoi working on his novel, and the
politicians in Paris were occupied with changing governments. When he became
prime minister for the second time, in February1883, Ferry discarded the draft
treaty of partition with China and ordered Rivière to proceed.
A few months earlier, in the autumn of1882, Le Myre de Vilers had been
replaced by Charles Antoine François Thomson (1845–1898), a former secretary
of Gambetta with an uncompromising attitude toward implementing the con-
quest of Vietnam. Ly Myre de Vilers had shown more interest in the internal
administration of Cochinchina than in being involved with the“Tonkin Ques-
tion.” Derived from Dong Kinh, the old name of Hanoi, Tonkin became colonial
terminology for the Red River plain.
In addition to affirming French law and implementing civilian government in
Cochinchina, Le Myre de Vilers was interested in expanding the possibilities of
Franco-Vietnamese cooperation. He started a program to send young Vietnam-
ese on visits to France, he established the Alliance Français in Saigon, he opened
procedures for Vietnamese to gain French citizenship, and he instituted the
Colonial Council of Cochinchina, partly appointed and partly elected, which
included Vietnamese representatives. Thomson continued these policies but at
the same time moved aggressively in Tonkin.
In March1883, roused from his pen, Rivière led his few hundred men to seize
the coal mines at Hon Gai, the port at Hai Phong, and the fortress at Nam Dinh,
thereby opening up the Red River plain for further French operations from the
sea. Within weeks, Qing military intervention recommenced in the northern
mountains, and Liu Yongfu moved downriver to confront the French. In May,
Liu Yongfu’s men killed Rivière in an ambush near Hanoi. Unlike the death of
Garnier a decade earlier, Rivière’s death provoked a great outburst of French
enthusiasm for continuing the intervention, and the French Parliament voted for
money and soldiers for the conquest of Vietnam.
Thousands of French and Chinese reinforcements poured into northern Viet-
nam during the summer and autumn of1883. A Qing army from Guangxi
moved down into the lowlands and occupied Bac Ninh, about thirty kilometers
northeast of Hanoi. Vietnamese military units under the command of Hoang Ta
Viem rallied at the Son Tay fortress, about thirty kilometers northwest of Hanoi
on the Red River, where they were joined by Liu Yongfu and Qing military units
from Yunnan. In December, Son Tay fell to the French. When the French moved

against Bac Ninh in March of1884, the Guangxi army, suffering from poor
leadership and lack of discipline, offered minimal resistance before escaping
north into the mountains. Hoang Ta Viem and Liu Yongfu had meanwhile
withdrawn to Hung Hoa, on the Red River about thirty kilometers northwest
of Son Tay. In April, French forces concentrated against Hung Hoa, bombarding
it with artillery and threatening to encircle it. Liu Yongfu escaped upriver with
his men and the Qing Yunnanese soldiers while Hoang Ta Viem fled with his
Vietnamese forces south through the mountains to Thanh Hoa.
On the basis of these French victories, pacifist elements in the Qing govern-
ment gained a brief ascendancy and in May negotiated an agreement with French
diplomats at Tientsin in northern China. The Tientsin Accord provided for
Chinese recognition of a French protectorate over Vietnam and withdrawal of
Chinese soldiers from Vietnam. But differing French and Chinese views about the
schedule for withdrawal of Qing troops led to a military encounter in June when
French troops moving north to occupy the border at Lang Son struck Qing
outposts. This episode stiffened bellicose spirits in both Paris and Beijing, and
the war was subsequently renewed.
By October of1884, the Quangxi army was threatening to re-emerge from the
mountains into the plains. In a series of battles, the French pushed back toward
Lang Son. Then, after weeks of preparation, in a two-week campaign in early
February1885, the French took Lang Son and Qing forces withdrew to the
border. Meanwhile, Liu Yongfu and Qing units from Yunnan had besieged the
French garrison at Tuyen Quang, which the French had seized from Liu Yongfu
the previous June. Tuyen Quang was isolated in the mountains about one
hundred kilometers northwest of Hanoi. The small French garrison, comprised
of four hundred legionnaires and two hundred Vietnamese troops, was nearly
overwhelmed before French reinforcements defeated the besiegers after hard
fighting in early March.
The French reinforcements for Tuyen Quang included units withdrawn from
Lang Son. The French commander left at Lang Son lost his nerve in late March
and ordered a panicked withdrawal that enabled the Chinese to reoccupy Lang
Son. The news of this retreat from Lang Son provoked a political crisis in Paris,
where the colonial adventure was suddenly vulnerable to critics. The Radical
Republicans, led by George Benjamin Clemenceau (1841–1929), who was later
famous as prime minister during and after the First World War, denounced
Prime Minister Ferry in Parliament. Ferry was voted out of office and his political
career was ended. A surge of anti-colonial sentiment swept away the influence of
the colonial lobby. Heated parliamentary debates over colonial policy continued
for months, and in December of1885 an appropriations bill to finance oper-
ations in Vietnam passed by only four votes.

Meanwhile, war with China was quickly concluded on the basis of the Tientsin
Accord of the previous year. China was also ready for peace, mainly as a result of
French naval operations along the Chinese coast that had blockaded the move-
ment of rice from southern China, causing a food shortage in northern China.
Liu Yongfu evacuated northern Vietnam with the Qing forces, ending his Viet-
namese career but beginning a new career in the Qing army.
With the end of the Sino-French War in early summer of1885, the French
began to give serious thought to organizing their newly won protectorate over
the court at Hue. During the preceding two years, while enthusiasm for colonial
expansion prevailed in Paris following the death of Rivière and while French
attention was fixed upon China, the royal court at Hue was divided between
those interested in working with the French and those aiming to resist the French.
Not until hopes and apprehensions of Qing intervention were extinguished did
the situation in Hue shift toward a definite resolution.
The French take Hue
King Tu Duc died in July1883. During the last year of his life, whatever
authority he still may have had was ebbing away as Rivière waited in Hanoi,
new Qing armies crossed the border, and Vietnamese officials in the north
prepared to resist the French despite their king’s passivity. Tu Duc seldom stirred
from his palace unless to visit the gardens built at his nearby tomb. Unable to
command the respect of his officials, he could not avoid relying upon men whom
he did not trust. He faded into a shadow of impotent fear. Prominent members of
the royal family and senior officials at Hue pulled in various directions in pursuit
of personal interests or clashing policy agendas.
The French chargé d’affaires at Hue, Pierre Paul Rheinart (1840–1902), was
relatively sympathetic toward the Vietnamese. He thought that Rivière had
exceeded his instructions and created an unnecessarily adversarial situation in
the north. He gave strong encouragement to those among the Vietnamese who
were inclined to view cooperation with the French as the best available
alternative.
Tran Tien Thanh (1813–1883) was the most senior of the officials who
favored this view. He was from the Hue area and had earned his doctoral degree
in1838. He had been a close associate of Phan Thanh Gian, with whom he had
traveled to France in1864. He was a respected academician. He understood that
resisting France was not a viable option.
Ton That Thuyet, the prince who had played a prominent role in the Garnier
affair of1873, had risen steadily thereafter to become the senior military official

at court. He stepped into the role of commanding general that had been occupied
by Nguyen Tri Phuong, who had died during the Garnier affair. He was irrecon-
cilably anti-French and was determined to resist any further assertion of French
authority at Hue.
The third man who emerged into prominence at Tu Duc’sd e a t hw a sN g u y e nV a n
Tuong (1810–1886). His eagerness to insinuate himself into the center of power was
already evident when he registered for the1841 regional examination at Hue with
the royal surname Nguyen Phuc. He may have wished to divert attention fromhis
real ancestry for, according to some accounts, his father had been a rebel. Thieu Tri
punished him with a term of banishment forlèse-majesté. His next recorded
appearance is in1856, during Tu Duc’s reign, as a district magistrate in his home
province of Quang Tri, a short distance north of Hue. His jurisdiction was along the
upland frontier of the Cam Lo Road that went over the mountains to Savannakhet
on the Mekong River in Laos. This was an important military and commercial route
where information from Siam was collected, merchants made profits, and relations
with upland populations were chronically troubled. Nguyen Van Tuong came to the
attention of the court in the1850s because of his success in sorting out problems
with minority peoples and in keeping open the flow of trade between Savannakhet
and Quang Tri. For the rest of his life he remained the royal expert on this place and
frequently returned to set things right.
He established a reputation for being competent and shrewd. When the
examination riots broke out at Hue in1864, Tu Duc put him in charge of
the Hue police. In1867 he went with a delegation to Saigon for talks with the
French, and thereafter Tu Duc began to rely on him to handle French relations.
In1869 he was sent to the northern mountains to assist in combating the rebels
and bandits that proliferated there. At times he worked as liaison with the Qing
army that arrived at Hue’s request. At other times he led soldiers on campaign.
Nguyen Tri Phuong praised his ability and observed that he could not be
motivated by the threat of demotion or the prospect of promotion, indicating
that he was able to focus on the task at hand.
Nguyen Van Tuong was an earthy man of few words who made the most of
whatever situation he encountered. He does not seem to have cared what others
thought of him, apparently because he knew that Tu Duc needed him. When Tu
Duc later asked him why the Qing soldiers were more successful than the
Vietnamese soldiers, he replied:“Our soldiers are not used to the mountains
and easily get sick; the Qing soldiers are used to the mountains and do not get
sick.” Tu Duc exploded in exasperation:“We have been fighting up there for
four or five years, we are worn out, and still we have no success; what should we
do?” Nguyen Van Tuong simply said:“We have done our best but it is not good
enough.” He did not spend time worrying about things he could not change.

During the Garnier affair of1873, Nguyen Van Tuong was called to Hue and sent
to Saigon to consult with the French. He traveled with Philastre to Hanoi, worked
with him to settle matters there, and subsequently negotiated the Treaty of1874.T u
Duc thereafter relied on him for advice on nearly all matters of consequence.In
particular, all foreign relations were in his hands. By the time of Tu Duc’s death,
Nguyen Van Tuong was having an affair with Hoc Phi, Tu Duc’sw i f e .
As Tu Duc lay dying in July1883, he is said to have entrusted the succession to
Tran Tien Thanh, Ton That Thuyet, and Nguyen Van Tuong. Childless, Tu Duc
had adopted three of his nephews: Duc Duc (1852–1883), Dong Khanh (1864–
1889), and Kien Phuc (1869–1884). Although Kien Phuc was the youngest, he
appears to have been the most intelligent, and some accounts affirm that he was
Tu Duc’s choice. However, after Tu Duc’s death, the three regents swore that on
his deathbed the king had designated Duc Duc, the eldest, as his successor. There
are indications that pressure from the palace women enforced this observance of
primogeniture. Three senior women, known collectively as“The Three Cham-
bers,” were particularly powerful. These were Tu Duc’s mother, Pham Thi Hang
(1810–1902), his wife Hoc Phi, and a surviving consort of Thieu Tri. These
women enforced a strict hierarchy among the palace women and any violation of
the rule of seniority in succession to the throne would have serious repercussions
on their control of the inner quarters.
Duc Duc was king for three days before being imprisoned and killed by the
three regents. What led to this royal homicide remains a matter of conjecture, but
something passed between Duc Duc and the regents that caused them to do away
with him. The31-year-old king may have made it clear that he did not want the
tutelage of the three older men, and they were surely unwilling to give up the
power to which they had grown accustomed under Tu Duc’s weak rule.
Perhaps seeking to minimize any objections from“The Three Chambers,” the
regents passed over the two young surviving adopted nephews and brought to
the throne Hiep Hoa (1847–1883), a 36-year-old younger half-brother of Tu
Duc. A senior Censorate official named Phan Dinh Phung (1844–1895) dared to
openly denounce the regents for their irregular handling of Tu Duc’s succession.
Ton That Thuyet arrested Phan Dinh Phung and sent him back to his home
village in Ha Tinh Province. Phan Dinh Phung had obtained his doctoral degree
only in1877 but had risen quickly in the Censorate because of his reputation for
rectitude. He later led an anti-French movement in his home district and subse-
quently was regarded by Vietnamese nationalists as a hero.
One month after the enthronement of Hiep Hoa, a French fleet landed troops
and overran the forts guarding access to Hue from the sea. Nguyen Van Tuong
hastened to sign what came to be called the Harmand Treaty, which met all
French demands as defined by François Jules Harmand (1845–1921). Harmand

was a naval physician who had played an enthusiastic role in the Garnier affair
and subsequently shifted into diplomatic service. In the summer of1883 he was
empowered by Paris to obtain a protectorate treaty with Hue. The Harmand
Treaty placed the Hue court under direct French supervision, annexed Binh
Thuan to Cochinchina, and created a Tonkin governed by Vietnamese magis-
trates under the authority of resident French administrators. Thanh Hoa, Nghe
An, and Ha Tinh were included in Tonkin and a French garrison was to be
placed on the border between Tonkin and the territory still under the government
of Hue, which the French called the Kingdom of Annam.
The Harmand Treaty shrank the territory under the direct governance of Hue
to the provinces from Quang Binh in the north to Khanh Hoa in the south. The
French were to have direct access to the rest of the country. Many politicians in
France considered the Harmand Treaty inappropriately ambitious during a time
of war with China. French leaders were reluctant to take responsibility for
governing so much of the Vietnamese population before matters were settled
with China. The Paris government never ratified the Harmand Treaty.
Meanwhile, King Hiep Hoa maintained an attitude of cooperating with the
French and relied on Tran Tien Thanh for advice. On the other hand he detested
Ton That Thuyet and Nguyen Van Tuong, primarily because they obstructed his
authority. Although Ton That Thuyet and Nguyen Van Tuong were not on good
terms personally, they were allied against anyone who threatened their respective
spheres of dominance, which for Ton That Thuyet was the army and for Nguyen
Van Tuong was the palace and the court. Ton That Thuyet realized that with
Hiep Hoa as king it would be impossible to organize resistance to the French. He
persuaded Nguyen Van Tuong to join him in a coup. In late November1883,
both Hiep Hoa and Tran Tien Thanh were put to death, and the two remaining
regents then brought to the throne14-year-old Kien Phuc. They expected that
Kien Phuc’s youth would ensure his compliance with their wishes.
During the false Sino-French peace after the signing of the TientsinAccord in May
1884, the French ambassador to China, Jules Patenôtre des Noyers, arrived atHue
and presented a new treaty to Nguyen Van Tuong, which Nguyen Van Tuong
readily signed. The Patenôtre Treaty, which became the basis of the subsequent
colonial relationship, was essentially the same as the Harmand Treaty except that
the four provinces that Harmand had detached to Cochinchina and Tonkin (Binh
Thuan, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa) were left in the Kingdom of Annam. In
early June, on the occasion of signing this new treaty, the gold and silver seal of
investiture given to Hue by Qing was melted down to symbolically bring an end to
the centuries of Vietnamese vassalage to Chinese dynasties.
The young king, Kien Phuc, was known for his integrity and wisdom, which
was his undoing. During the months following Kien Phuc’s enthronement, Ton

That Thuyet, with the approbation of Nguyen Van Tuong, began to organize a
private army, separate from the regular military forces, loyal to him personally.
Ton That Thuyet continued to harbor the dream of attacking the French and
driving them into the sea. Kien Phuc understood the folly of this and was an
obstacle to Ton That Thuyet’s plans. Furthermore, Kien Phuc was reportedly
outraged over the illicit relationship between Nguyen Van Tuong and Hoc Phi.
Accordingly, the two kingmakers resolved to be rid of him. At the end of July
1884, Kien Phuc died, plausibly of illness but more likely of poison. A12-year-
old half-brother of Kien Phuc named Ham Nghi (1872–1943) was placed on the
throne. Ham Nghi was the pliant tool that Ton That Thuyet had been seeking.
During the months that followed, as the Sino-French War ran its course, Ton
That Thuyet stored weapons in the mountains and made plans to resist the
French.
So long as the French were occupied with the Chinese war and made no further
moves to assert their authority at Hue, the situation remained quiet. However,
with the end of the Sino-French War in spring of1885, the assignment of
Philippe Marie Henri Roussel de Courcy (1827–1887) to begin implementing
the Patenôtre Treaty ended the calm. De Courcy was a career army officer with a
record of distinguished service in nearly every French war since the1850s. But
this was his first experience in Asia, and his blustering demeanor, devoid of
nuance or of any sensitivity to local conditions, persuaded Ton That Thuyet that
the time of decision had arrived.
In early July 1885, Ton That Thuyet launched a nighttime attack on the
French garrison in Hue and used the ensuing confusion and panic to stampede
the royal court out of the capital. The refugees gathered at the provincial capital
of Quang Tri, around sixty kilometers north of Hue, and deliberated about what
to do. Ton That Thuyet announced his plans to take the small king to the
mountains and appealed for followers. However, he was trusted by very few,
and, with so much royal blood on his hands, he did not inspire confidence among
members of the royal family or the court. Most chose to follow Nguyen Van
Tuong and Pham Thi Hang, Tu Duc’s mother and the matriarch of the royal
family, back to Hue where they submitted to the French. A few weeks later, the
last surviving adopted nephew of Tu Duc and elder half-brother of Ham Nghi,
Dong Khanh, was made king at Hue.
Meanwhile, Ton That Thuyet issued a proclamation in the name of King Ham
Nghi calling on the Vietnamese to rise up against the French. He installed Ham
Nghi in the mountainous wilderness near the Laotian border around ten kilo-
meters south of the Ha Tinh–Quang Binh provincial boundary, leaving him in
the care of his two sons. He then departed northward through the mountains on
a journey to seek the help of China, from where he never returned. Along the

way, he endeavored to stir up anti-French activity. Ton That Thuyet’s schemes
left a trail of misery and death.
Hoang Ta Viem, the royal son-in-law who had commanded Vietnamese forces
in northern Vietnam since the1860s and had collaborated with Liu Yongfu
against the French during the Garnier and Rivière affairs and the dry-season
battles of1883–1884, had known Ton That Thuyet for many years and looked
askance at what this man had done. He rallied members of the royal family and
their entourages behind King Dong Khanh and, in late1886, unsuccessfully
endeavored to persuade Ham Nghi’s keepers to come down from the mountains.
Ton That Thuyet’s dramatic appeal to fight the French on behalf of a king in
the mountains unleashed a rage of violence against Christians, the most vulner-
able targets of anti-French enthusiasm. The number of Christians killed in the
months that followed is unknown, but published estimates range from forty
thousand to well over fifty thousand. Acts of resistance to the French appeared
in many areas but were most persistent in the provinces north of Hue, particularly
in Ha Tinh, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa, where there were significant numbers of
Christians and where a relatively large population of educated men had been
alienated by Tu Duc’s failures of leadership. Village scholars, having grown
frustrated with palace-bound royal leadership, were exhilarated to be called on
by a king who had taken to the countryside to resist the French.
During the autumn of1885, the French army was greatly diminished by a cholera
epidemic and did little more than attempt to protect endangered Christian commu-
nities. De Courcy considered Nguyen Van Tuong to be devious and exiled him to
Tahiti where he soon died. In Paris, the French government was still digestingthe
shock of the so-called“Tonkin Affair” of the previous spring when French forces
had retreated in panic from Lang Son, provoking a parliamentary crisis thathad
brought an end to the Ferry government and a hasty conclusion to the Sino-French
War. There were heated debates over policy in Vietnam and approval for continued
operations there was voted by a very narrow margin. General de Courcy was
denounced for having unnecessarily provoked a dismaying situation with his exces-
sive arrogance. Furthermore, in the summer of1885, Governor General Thomson
at Saigon, in his effort to enhance French authority in Cambodia, had managed to
stimulate a brief but widespread anti-French uprising among the Khmers.
Formation of French Indochina
A new policy initiative was needed to sustain the colonial project in Vietnam. The
man selected to implement this was Paul Bert (1833–1886), a man of science,
professor of physiology, and staunch anti-cleric who entered politics as a

follower of Gambetta, for whom he served as Minister of Education. He arrived
at Hue in April1886 in the midst of the military emergency, but he understood
that the fundamental problem was political, not military. Turning against the
tide of French colonial thought in Cochinchina, he established a new focus for
colonial leadership to deal with the Hue court and the existing Vietnamese
administration in Annam and Tonkin. A group of men who went to Vietnam
with him became the first of those who served as resident supervisors of Viet-
namese magistrates and who would eventually provide the expertise needed to
establish the General Government of French Indochina. Bert succeeded in laying
the basis for a working relationship between French and Vietnamese officials. He
acknowledged the cultural norms of Vietnamese officialdom and provided for
traditionally educated Vietnamese to continue to have careers in government
service. Although he survived in Vietnam for only about six months, dying of
dysentery in November, he was a major architect of French rule in Vietnam. He
solidified a cooperative relationship with the royal family and opened the way
for a new kind of colonial administrator for whom Hanoi became the seat of
authority.
In the late 1880s and early 1890s, the French encountered two forms of
resistance in the provinces north of Hue. First was the response to Ton That
Thuyet’s call to rally under King Ham Nghi’s banner against the invaders.
Educated men with positions of local prominence organized offensive operations
and prepared defensive positions. In addition to resisting the French, three other
more purely domestic factors were prominent in this fighting. One was the
conflict between Christian and non-Christian Vietnamese, which became espe-
cially virulent in the context of French pacification efforts. Another was the
difference of opinion among educated men about the merits of resistance. Most
upper-echelon Vietnamese officials followed the thinking of the court at Hue that
resistance to the French was not only hopeless but would simply bring death and
misery to the people; furthermore, as they became aware of events in the wider
world, they could see no plausible alternative to French rule. These people
provided intelligence and propaganda, performed administrative tasks, and
organized military units to assist the French.
A final aspect was regional and, to some extent, even dynastic. The ancestors
of educated men in the north had served the Le dynasty for centuries. As late as
the1860s, major uprisings could be launched in the north on behalf of Le
pretenders. The loyalty of these men was not to the“southern” Nguyen dynasty
so much as to the ideals of their Confucian education, which they believed to be
threatened by the French. This contrasted with educated men in provinces further
south, for whom loyalty to the Nguyen dynasty was the foundation of political
behavior. Once Paul Bert had made it clear that the French would discard neither

the Nguyen dynasty nor the class of men educated to serve it, the path was open
for literati of all regions to serve the French.
Ham Nghi was too young and passive to play any role in these events. He lived
in a hut on a remote mountain, watched over by Ton That Thuyet’s sons and half
a dozen servants and guards. In late1888, one of his guards and the local
strongman who had been providing him food brought him out to the French,
who sent him to a new life in Algeria. One of Ton That Thuyet’s sons was killed
in this episode and another son killed himself. By this time, the French had
already subdued the major center of resistance in Thanh Hoa, at Ba Dinh.
A few months later, the major center of resistance in the Red River plain, at
Bai Say, was also overrun.
Thereafter, those still unreconciled to the French rallied behind Phan Dinh
Phung, the Censorate official who had been escorted back to his village after
denouncing Ton That Thuyet and the other regents for their irregular handling of
succession to the throne after Tu Duc’s death in July1883. In the early1890sh e
organized a small army in southern Ha Tinh. After many defeats, he was forced
to take refuge in the mountains where he died in late1895.
The second form of resistance was a greater problem for the French than these
uprisings led by local scholars, for it came from a resistance to government of any
kind that had been endemic for generations. The Trinh regime had never estab-
lished a stable agrarian policy. From the early eighteenth century, rebellion was
chronic among the people of the Red River plain. The Nguyen dynasty never
achieved a complete pacification of the north. During Tu Duc’s reign, there was a
trend toward misgovernment, insubordination, and banditry, which accelerated
with rebellions led by Le pretenders in the1850s and 1860s and with the
disorders of the Garnier and Rivière affairs and the Sino-French War in the
1870s and 1880s. Chinese adventurers and Qing armies had possessed much
of the upland hinterland of the Red River plain since the1860s, providing refuge,
arms, and encouragement to Vietnamese fugitives. Chinese pirates prowled the
coast, often assisted by Vietnamese outlaws, conducting a brisk business of
kidnapping women and children to sell into slavery in China. By the late
1880s, the Red River plain had been without effective government for decades.
Here, the French faced not organized resistance led by men who could be
defeated or won over but rather an entire society that had grown accustomed
to evading authority. Resistance to the French became a legitimizing tag for
lawlessness in general.
An essential element of the French pacification effort was to secure the Sino-
Vietnamese frontier, thereby breaking the connection between the Chinese and
Vietnamese underworlds. It was also essential for the French to demonstrate to
the Vietnamese that they had come to stay and that colonial rule was much

preferable to anarchy. The question of how to do this was answered by Jean
Marie Antoine de Lanessan (1843–1919). He was a naval physician in Cochin-
china in the1860s, and in the1870s he became a professor of medicine before
entering politics. He made an official visit to Vietnam in the late1880s and took
an interest in theories of colonialism. He believed that the only justifiable
purpose of colonialism was to serve as the agent of change to bring defenseless,
out-of-date countries up to the highest possible level of administrative order and
technical efficiency. He was convinced that the only way to do this was by
working through the existing structures of authority.
When he was named Governor General of Indochina in1891, de Lanessan
successfully used the royal court to strengthen the relationship between Vietnam-
ese officials and the French. Dong Khanh had died of illness in1889 and was
succeeded as king by Thanh Thai (1879–1954), the10-year-old son of Duc Duc.
Although his father’s murder in1883 appears to have deprived him of a cheerful
or trusting demeanor, Thanh Thai learned to play his assigned role in the French
colonial order.
De Lanessan understood that the problem of pacifying the north was political
as much as it was military. He reorganized military operations to be conducted in
close collaboration with efforts to build a civil administration. His approach was
implemented by two army officers who later gained fame in the history of the
French army: Joseph Simon Gallieni (1849–1916), who served in Vietnam from
1892 to 1896, and Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey (1854–1934), who served in
Vietnam from1894 to 1897. These men implemented what came to be known as
the “oil spot” method of pacification, in which military operations moved
forward incrementally no faster than the pace at which civil government could
be stabilized. Whereas in1888 French troops in Tonkin numbered14,000 with
20,000 Vietnamese commanded by French officers, in1894 the troop level had
fallen to 5,000 French and 12,000 Vietnamese. By 1896, the pacification pro-
gram was completed.
De Lanessan also initiated a series of events that forced Siam to cede control of
Laos. When Siam resisted the movement of French military units into Laos in spring
of1893, French ships forced their way upriver from the Gulf of Siam to place the
royal palace in Bangkok under their guns. The Siamese subsequently signed a treaty
with France renouncing Laos east of the Mekong. In later treaties, in1904 and
1907, Siam gave up two Laotian territories west of the Mekong, as well as the
northwestern Cambodian provinces that had been annexed a century before. The
modern borders of Thailand with Laos and Cambodia were thus drawn.
In the 1880s and 1890s, the British were consolidating their control over
northern Burma. In1896, a Franco-British treaty set the Mekong River as the
boundary between British Burma and French Indochina. The territories that

would make up French Indochina were thus defined by the mid1890s. But the
question of how they would be administered provoked a decade of conflict
between the colonial government that had been developing since the1860si n
Saigon and the new corps of administrators at Hanoi.
Cochinchina, with its port of Saigon and capacity to export rice, wasa consistent
generator of revenue surplus, but the Cochinchinese system of government recycled
most of the profits into the pockets of administrators and members of the French
colon community. The nascent Indochinese government being established at Hanoi
was saddled with the deficits created by efforts to pacify and govern a territory in
which a stable system of administration and of taxation did not yet exist. The
considerable French colon community in Saigon fiercely rejected the argument that
Cochinchina should help to defray the expenses of the larger Indochinese project.
The French in Saigon had developed an effective lobby to represent their interests in
Paris. For all of his success in pacifying the north and asserting the Mekong as a
western border, de Lanessan was powerless before the Saigon lobby in Paris. In
1894, he was abruptly recalled when his efforts to incorporate Saigon into the
Indochinese budget failed to prevail over the entrenched political connections
between Saigon and Paris.
Since the days of the admirals in Saigon, French people, however lowly their
status in metropolitan French society may have been, found in Cochinchina a
lordly lifestyle and a subservient population. They devised an administration that
promoted their personal enrichment. The prospect of having to contribute sur-
plus revenue to a budget covering all of Indochina was for them an unwelcome
shock. The Saigon Frenchmen were represented in the Chamber of Deputies and
had considerable influence in Paris. They fought stubbornly against the forma-
tion of a central Indochina government.
On the other hand, from the time of Paul Bert, administrators in Hanoi began
to entertain the vision of a colonial government in which Cochinchina was
simply one among several subordinate units. Beginning in1887, efforts to
achieve such a government were announced as the aim of French policy. Never-
theless, the French colons of Saigon managed to maintain their autonomy and to
thwart any attempt to incorporate Cochinchina into a larger Indochina.
De Lanessan was replaced by Paul Armand Rousseau (1835–1896), an engineer
and politician with a level of experience and seniority deemed sufficient to enable
him to sort out the conflict of interests between Saigon and Hanoi. Rousseau
continued the policies of de Lanessan and was soon in a stalemate with Saigon.
He returned to Paris to obtain sufficient authority to bring Cochinchina under the
budgetary and administrative authority of Hanoi. In declining health, he intended to
resign but died in late1896. Such was the situation when Paul Doumer (1857–1932)
was appointed to be Governor General of Indochina in early1897.

From a working-class background, raised by a widowed mother, Doumer
excelled at his studies and was a mathematics teacher by the age of20.H e
worked for a time in journalism and subsequently entered politics, becoming a
specialist in financial affairs. By the early1890s, he was the parliamentary expert
on the Indochinese budget. He was Minister of Finance in the brief“radical”
cabinet of Leon Bourgeois (November1895 to April 1896). His efforts to use
fiscal policy to effect social reform contributed to bringing down the Bourgeois
government. He was strong-minded and decisive. With his knowledge of colonial
budgets, it was convenient for his political enemies to send him out of their way
to a difficult assignment in Indochina.
During his five-year term as governor general (1897–1902), Doumer estab-
lished a structure of administration and a set of policies that none of his succes-
sors significantly altered. Despite the bitter opposition of Le Myre de Vilers, then
serving as the Cochinchinese representative in the Chamber of Deputies, Doumer
asserted Hanoi’s authority over all five Indochinese jurisdictions: the protector-
ates of Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia, and Laos, and the colony of Cochinchina.
Although Cochinchina retained many distinctive characteristics, being not a
protectorate but rather a colony governed under French law, Doumer neverthe-
less brought it into the framework of a unified budget and of a single authority
for government operations. Senior Residents were appointed to administer the
four protectorates, but a Lieutenant Governor sat at Saigon.
The construction of an effective central government was one of Doumer’s
achievements. Behind this achievement was a balanced budget that for the first
time made Indochina a generator of revenue, ending its financial dependency
upon Paris. By1899, a comprehensive tax regime began to produce large
surpluses. In addition to land taxes, poll taxes, excise taxes, and an array of
administrative fees, government monopolies were organized on salt, alcohol, and
opium. The Bank of Indochina was opened in Hanoi to process revenue and
expenditure. With a stable budget, Doumer was able to float large loans to
initiate ambitious infrastructure projects for roads, railroads, bridges, canals,
and harbors. In addition to administration, finance, and public works, culture
and scholarship were also on his agenda. In1900, he set up the French School of
the Far East (École Française d’Extrême-Orient), which became a major center of
academic research on Asia.
Doumer’s activist leadership was controversial and provoked sharp criticism,
but his achievements were relatively solid and enduring. He returned from
Indochina to continue his political career in France, eventually becoming Presi-
dent in1931. Paul Beau (1857–1927), a career diplomat who had been Minis-
ter to China, succeeded him in Indochina. Beau’s term as governor general
(1902–1907) was relatively calm and uneventful. After Doumer, there were no

major problems to solve, and the Vietnamese reaction to what Doumer had
done was not yet apparent.
During the four decades since the French had taken Saigon, French ambitions
in Asia had struggled for fulfillment until Doumer established French Indochina
in its definitive form. Two salient reasons appear to explain the failure of
Vietnamese resistance to the French. First, there was a collapse of leadership.
Tu Duc could not govern a country that he never knew or understood, being a
bookish creature of the palace. He was unable either to maintain the domestic
peace or to unite the country against a foreign threat. The north was already in a
state of endemic rebellion before the French arrived. Then, the regicidal regency
of Ton That Thuyet and Nguyen Van Tuong was the best that the Hue court
could provide by way of leadership during the most critical phase of the French
conquest. Neither Ton That Thuyet’s reckless schemes nor Nguyen Van Tuong’s
palace intrigues inspired confidence. The alacrity with which the adult leaders of
the royal family and its courtiers made peace with the French in1885 revealed an
absence of options.
The second, and more fundamental, reason for failure can be found in the
larger context of the global situation in which European imperial powers were
dominating Asia. The only exceptions to this were Japan, which successfully
adapted to global changes, Siam, which survived as a semi-colony and conveni-
ent buffer between the British and the French, and China, which, although
surrendering control of its seaports, had large continental territories where its
own political development could continue. Vietnam did not have the samurai
leadership of Japan that understood and solved the military problem. It did not
have the benefit of a geographical position, as Siam did, that enabled it to enjoy a
place of balance between two predatory powers. Nor did it have the vast
hinterland of China in which it could sustain the semblance of an independent
country. Considering Vietnam’s vulnerable terrain and the structural limitations
of a government at Hue, there is no apparent reason to think that more effective
leadership could have responded successfully to the French challenge. The French
conquest brought Vietnamese out of the mono-centric political and cultural focus
upon China that had previously prevailed and into a larger world of potentially
multi-polar relationships.

11 FRANCO-VIETNAMESE COLONIAL RELATIONS
Intellectuals respond to the colonial regime
By the turn of the century, many educated Vietnamese were endeavoring to think
their way through the events of the French conquest, aiming to arrive at some
vision of a future for themselves or for their country. Not all Vietnamese were
concerned with ideas about a Vietnamese country. The uneducated and probably
most of the educated, though it is impossible to estimate with any certainty how
many, were chiefly concerned with the welfare of themselves and their families,
and they had no definite sense of identification with a nation in the twentieth-
century sense. Prior ideas about a Vietnamese country had been almost entirely
focused upon the monarchy and upon the mandarinate as an extension of it,
which became decreasingly plausible as French rule stabilized.
In Cochinchina, the process of colonial transformation was already into a
second generation of Vietnamese for whom the Nguyen monarchy at Hue had no
concrete presence in their lives. The traditional mandarinate did not exist for
them and educational opportunities pointed toward reading and writing alpha-
betically in the French and Vietnamese languages. Classical studies and character
writing survived for a time in private schools, but soon faded away. Early
twentieth-century responses to French rule in Cochinchina emerged with urban
journalism, covert support of a monarch in exile, and rural millenarian
movements.
In Annam and Tonkin, the mandarinate continued to exist, presided over by a
king and staffed by men educated in character writing, and whose educational
and career aspirations were defined by the civil service examination system.
Although fewer and fewer men showed interest in the examinations and they
were abolished after1919, and although the greatest challenge to French coloni-
alism would come with a later generation of people educated in French and
Vietnamese, the ferment of ideas among the last generation to be educated in
Literary Chinese characters demonstrated a deep intellectual engagement with

the colonial situation arising from the Confucian curriculum that emphasized a
commitment to public affairs.
Estimates of the number of men who entered the triennial examinations fall
from around six thousand in the late nineteenth century to four thousand at the
turn of the century to not many more than one thousand by the1910s. Regional
exam graduates staffed most mandarinal positions in the protectorates of Annam
and Tonkin. During the eleven examinations held under French supervision,
from1889 to 1919, 83 doctorates and 107 junior doctorates were awarded.
The impact of Paul Doumer’s governorship is apparent in an analysis of these
190 men. Doumer detached the mandarins in Tonkin from the Hue court and
put them under direct French supervision. Thereafter, the number of degrees
awarded to people from Tonkin fell dramatically. In the five exams from1889 to
1901, 34.2 percent of the higher degrees were awarded to men from Tonkin.
However, only 12.9 percent of the higher degrees in the six subsequent exams
were awarded to men from Tonkin. On the other hand, while men from the
northern provinces of Annam (Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh, commonly
referred to as Thanh-Nghe-Tinh) received15.3 percent of the higher degrees
through 1901, they received53.8 percent of those awarded thereafter. The three
provinces in the plains adjacent to Hue (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua
Thien) increased their collective percentage more modestly, from18 percent to
24.7 percent. In the provinces south of Hue, the number of higher graduates
declined from 14.4 percent to 8.6 percent, a decline even sharper if calculated
with the turn point at1908 when uprisings broke out there.
The region that became pre-eminent in classical studies during the early years
of French rule, the provinces of Nghe An and Ha Tinh, commonly referred to as
Nghe-Tinh, produced people who responded to French rule with a degree of
intellectual engagement and political activism that put them, in numbers dispro-
portionate to other regions, at the forefront of national leadership when the
colonial regime failed at mid century. From1889 to 1919, 30 percent of all
higher degrees in the country were awarded to men from Nghe-Tinh; calculating
from1904 to 1919, it was40 percent. This region, in the plains of the Ca River,
was already famous as a cradle of scholars. It was known for chronic poverty,
which was widely presumed to have driven its young men to study in order to
improve their prospects. During the French era, it was an overflowing reservoir
of young men eager to see the world and susceptible to radical ideas about ending
the colonial regime.
Nghe-Tinh was the center of anti-Christian agitation in the1870sa n d1880sa n d
of the most persistent resistance to the French conquest into the1890s. In the1900s,
many Nghe-Tinh people went into exile to Japan and China in search of a way to
expel the French. During the First World War, men from Thanh-Nghe-Tinh

made up over half of all Vietnamese that volunteered to go to France as soldiers or
workers, with most of these being from Nghe-Tinh.
In the1920s, Nghe-Tinh youth were a significant element among the Vietnam-
ese who went to southern China to join anti-French groups associated with the
Chinese communists and nationalists. More than a few Vietnamese communist
leaders came from Nghe-Tinh, including Ho Chi Minh, and one of the three
Vietnamese groups claiming to be a communist party in1929–1930 was based
there. The Nghe-Tinh soviet uprising in1930–1931 was the largest episode of
violent resistance to French rule during the first four decades of the twentieth
century. The communist-led resistance to the French in the late1940s and early
1950s was strongly supported by the populations of Thanh-Nghe-Tinh, and the
government established in northern Vietnam after the departure of the French in
1954included many people from these provinces.
One aspect of Thanh-Nghe-Tinh that was distinctive under French rule is that
it was the least“supervised” of all Vietnamese regions. Making up“northern
Annam,” this region did not experience the degree of direct French rule that
prevailed in Tonkin and, to an even greater extent, in Cochinchina. But neither
did it experience the degree of royal authority that prevailed in southern Annam,
for only in the nineteenth century had it become part of the Nguyen dynastic
realm, and even then it never displayed a sense of connection or of loyalty to the
Nguyen monarchy such as existed in the other coastal provinces that were
governed by the protectorate regime at Hue. Thanh-Nghe-Tinh was in a relative
backwater where the administrative energies radiating from Hanoi and Hue were
not fully present. At the same time, many educated men of the region learned to
combine their alienation from the protectorate regime with a sense of patriotic
attachment to an idealized nation.
A fashionable current of thought among the Tonkin mandarins who worked
in close proximity with the center of French authority at Hanoi was an interest in
the“new learning” about the modern world that was flooding in from France.
This interest remained vague and unfocused, however, because there seemed to
be no way to incorporate it into the prevailing ideology and careerism of the
mandarinate. A minor trend in Tonkin reacted against the“new learning” by
proposing religion as the foundation of a strong future Vietnamese country. Kieu
Oanh Mau (1854–1912), despite his checkered career in the Tonkin mandarin-
ate, wrote and published books about Buddhism and popular religious cults. He
claimed a spiritual heritage as the most potent Vietnamese asset amidst the
tumults of the modern world. The French considered him harmless and allowed
him to publish.
In general, mandarinal officials throughout Annam and Tonkin tended to
become timeservers, primarily interested in maintaining the social position of

their families. Ironically, this class of people had never been as powerful as it
became under French rule. Unlike earlier generations of officials, who were often
in delicate situations, having to mediate between volatile local interests and a
distant, distracted, or weak central authority, twentieth-century magistrates were
backed by the considerable coercive powers of an alert and modern colonial
regime. Consequently, they espoused the Confucian social values of their educa-
tion with unprecedented vehemence and effect. As time passed and the classical
curriculum that was the ostensible source of their moral authority withered
away, they were increasingly viewed by the younger generation as hypocritical
guardians of a tradition that they had betrayed. This contradiction between
assertions of authority based on tradition being enforced by a modern colonial
regime became apparent earliest in southern Annam, where the Nguyen Phuc
family had ruled for over three centuries and where mandarinal officials were
connected and committed to the royal court at Hue to a relatively greater degree
than were officials in Tonkin or northern Annam.
The royal court, however, was in various phases of disarray during the reign of
Thanh Thai. He became king at the age of10 in 1889 and grew to manhood
leaving a trail of scandals that some nationalist historians have endeavored to
portray as acts of resistance to French rule. A son of Duc Duc, who had been
killed by the regents after only three days as king in1883, Thanh Thai was
intelligent, wary, and prone to licentious habits that often turned violent. His
interest in being“modern” as displayed in cutting his hair, wearing Western
suits, and driving cars made him acceptable to the French for several years.
However, in1906, a new French“high resident” in Hue began to take exception
to Thanh Thai’s behavior, and demonstrations of antagonism between the two
men escalated. In early1907, Thanh Thai publicly expressed a hope that Japan
would expel the French from his country, and the French intercepted correspond-
ence between him and anti-French exiles in China. He was promptly deposed,
removed to confinement in the southern coastal resort town of Vung Tau, and
replaced by his8-year-old son.
The reign name assigned to the small new monarch, Duy Tan, is striking
evidence that hopes for change were exceedingly widespread among Vietnamese
at that time. Duy Tan, a classical expression, literally“to be attached to the
new,” is generally translated as“reformation,” but in Vietnamese can also be
glossed as doi moi, “to change to the new,” which as the name for a recent
government policy has been translated as“renovation.” In 1907, apparently
unbeknownst to the French, Duy Tan also happened to be the name of a secret
organization dedicated to the expulsion of the French that already had followers
in all of the Vietnamese territories. The leading figure in this organization
was a regional exam graduate of1900 from Nghe An named Phan Boi Chau

(1867–1940). By1904, when he and a group of disaffected men from northern
and southern Annam established the Duy Tan Society, he had already found a
prince of the royal family willing to serve as an anti-French pretender to the
throne. This was Cuong De (1882–1951), a fourth-generation descendent of
Prince Canh, the eldest son of Gia Long who had died as crown prince. In
1907, when Thanh Thai expressed his hope for help from Japan, both Phan
Boi Chau and Cuong De were in Tokyo with the same hope.
In the early1900s, Phan Boi Chau and other educated Vietnamese concerned
about the colonial situation were reading the writings of the Chinese reformers
Kang Youwei (1858–1927) and Liang Qichao (1873–1929). In addition to
elaborating ideas about constitutional monarchy and democracy, these men
conveyed to readers of Literary Chinese descriptions of the Meiji reforms in
Japan and the thought of European political and social philosophers. Liang
Qichao, living in exile in Tokyo, was especially active as a translator of European
writers and as a pioneer for using journalism for political propaganda. Phan Boi
Chau met Liang Qichao in Tokyo and obtained from him advice as well as
introductions to Japanese politicians, which for a few years made it plausible for
anti-colonial Vietnamese to look hopefully to Japan. Japan’s prestige as an Asian
power was unsurpassed as a result of its defeats in war of first China and then
Russia. Liang Qichao and his Japanese contacts advised Phan Boi Chau to send
Vietnamese students to Japan as a first step.
By 1907, over one hundred Vietnamese boys had arrived in Japan to receive
a modern education. More than half of these aspiring students came from
Cochinchina and most of the expenses of this educational program came from
landowners there. These men were wealthy and therefore able to finance Phan
Boi Chau’s activities. They were also dissatisfied with the French regime, both for
its racism toward them and for how it facilitated the dominance of Chinese
entrepreneurs in the local economy. Furthermore, feelings of loyalty to Cuong
De were easily aroused among them because of local memories of Cuong De’s
ancestor Prince Canh, who had governed at Saigon until his death. Furthermore,
Cochinchina tended to be alienated from the line of Minh Mang, which, after
slandering the southern hero Le Van Duyet, had abandoned the far south to the
French. During the next four decades, Cuong De’s most faithful adherents were
in Cochinchina. On the other hand, the most active partisans of Phan Boi Chau’s
program to forcibly expel the French were largely from his home region of
northern Annam.
The activities of the Duy Tan Society were but the most adventurous aspect of
a great ferment among educated Vietnamese inspired by Chinese authors and
translators and by Japanese success in modernizing. Phan Boi Chau’s emphasis
upon seeking foreign assistance to overthrow the French was not shared by men

who believed that the Vietnamese should rely upon themselves to supersede the
colonial situation by learning from it. Prominent among these were three men
from Quang Nam. Tran Quy Cap (1870–1908) and Huynh Thuc Khang
(1876–1947) had both received doctoral degrees in the examination of1904,
but rather than pursuing a career in officialdom, they joined Phan Chu Trinh
(1872–1926), recipient of a junior doctoral degree in1901, and set themselves
against the mandarinal regime, regarding it as an obstacle to the progress of
their country. In1905, these three men traveled through southern Annam,
speaking against what they viewed as an outmoded educational and adminis-
trative system. As men who had passed the examinations at the highest level,
their words carried weight. But this also earned them the hatred of men who
inhabited the protectorate regime.
In 1906, Phan Chu Trinh went to Japan to see for himself the country in which
Phan Boi Chau was placing his trust, but he returned to Vietnam with visions of
making modern education available in his homeland rather than sending stu-
dents to study abroad. He wrote a letter to Governor General Paul Beau vainly
appealing for the French to discard the examination system, the monarchy, and
the mandarinal structure of administration and instead to institute reforms to
modernize the country.
In 1907, Phan Chu Trinh and like-minded men promoted the opening of
schools, inspired by the writings and the example of Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835–
1901), whose efforts to make modern education available to all Japanese had led
to the founding of Keio University. These schools promoted literacy in the
Vietnamese alphabet and spread information about history, literature, science,
and hygiene. The best-known of these schools was the one established in Hanoi,
the Tonkin Public School (Dong Kinh Nghia Thuc). For several months in late
1907and early 1908, until closed down by the French, it bustled with classes,
public lectures, publications, theatrical productions, and campaigns to“modern-
ize,” which could mean something as simple as cutting one’s hair, a violation of
the Confucian code of filial piety, or as complex as organizing business ventures,
thereby entering the dangerous realm of the colonial economy. Similar schools
were also set up in southern Annam, particularly in Quang Nam, the home
province of Phan Chu Trinh and other prominent reformists.
There was an overlap of people involved in this educational movement from
both those of Phan Chu Trinh’s reformist persuasion and those more inclined
toward Phan Boi Chau’s advocacy of an armed uprising against the French. The
more radical edge of these activities provoked the French to shut the Hanoi
school, but not before a momentum of public awareness and conspiratorial
schemes produced an outbreak of disorders in1908 that led to a shift in the
rhetoric of French colonial policy and in Vietnamese responses to it.

The 1908 disturbances and their sequel
In Quang Nam, the operations of Phan Boi Chau’s Duy Tan Society, the modern-
izing schools inspired by Phan Chu Trinh, heavy French demands for corvée labor
to exploit coal mines, the irresponsible behavior of Vietnamese magistrates, and a
relatively large peasant population in distress all overlapped and, in March1908,
combined to initiate three months of disturbances that spread down the coast
through Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen Provinces. Thousands of peasants
attacked tax collectors and camped around administrative centers until dispersed
by French soldiers with episodes of violence and loss of life.
In late June1908, a conspiracy was put in motion to spark an insurrection by
poisoning the French garrison in Hanoi; mutinous Vietnamese soldiers were to
be mobilized and supported by Hoang Hoa Tham (1858–1913), the last survivor
from the anti-French resistance who was ensconced in the mountains. Young
men inspired by Phan Boi Chau and by the excitement generated around the
Tonkin Public School initiated this event. The plot was poorly planned and the
French quickly squelched it.
Hoang Hoa Tham (also known as De Tham) came from an upland family that
had participated in the anti-Nguyen uprising led by Nong Van Van in the1830s.
He made his career among the mixture of Chinese and Vietnamese who followed
Liu Yongfu in the1870s and 1880s and negotiated an arrangement with the
French in the late1890s that allowed him to survive in the mountains of Yen The
district north of Bac Giang, east of Thai Nguyen, and southwest of Lang Son, a
region with very difficult terrain. His implication in the Hanoi poison plot led the
French to move determinedly against him, which ended with his death in1913.
Meanwhile, in Cochinchina, Gilbert Tran Chanh Chieu ( 1867–1919), a
French citizen who was a Saigon newspaper editor and businessman, was
arrested, along with many of his associates, when the French became aware of
his activities on behalf of Phan Boi Chau. He had been the in-country contact for
sending funds and students from Cochinchina to Phan Boi Chau in Japan. The
French had informants among a group of wealthy Cochinchinese who traveled
with aspiring students to meet with Phan Boi Chau in Japan in early1908.
Consequently, France pressured Japan to expel the Vietnamese, which was done
in1909. Phan Boi Chau went to southern China where he fruitlessly endeavored
to buy arms for Hoang Hoa Tham. Cuong De spent several years traveling in
China, Siam, Europe, and even made a brief clandestine visit to his supporters in
Cochinchina in1913. He returned to Japan during the First World War, from
where he thereafter conducted ineffectual anti-French activities with frequent
visits to China.

Paul Beau completed his term as governor general and departed Indochina in
February 1908, just before the disturbances began. Louis Alphonse Bonhoure
(1864–1909), a colonial functionary recently arrived from an assignment in
French Guiana, was acting governor general during the troubles from February
to September1908, at which time he was replaced by Antony Wladislas Klobu-
kowski (1855–1934). Klobukowski had started his career as a colonial adminis-
trator in Vietnam in the1880s. He became a close associate of Paul Bert in1886
and married Bert’s daughter. Thereafter he served in a number of other colonial
assignments but was sent back to Indochina in1908 because of his prior experi-
ence there, his association with Paul Bert’s success in establishing the protector-
ate regime, and his reputation for efficient administration.
In retrospect, it may appear that the most important aspect of the1908
disturbances was the road not taken by French authorities, as if they were
incapable of comprehending Phan Chu Trinh’s critique of the mandarinate and
of acting on it to promote a more modern administration. The inability of the
French regime to abandon the mandarinate, despite its corruption, which was
obvious even to the French, might plausibly be attributed to Klobukowski
because of his prior investment in Bert’s policy of relying upon this class of
Vietnamese officials. However, Phan Chu Trinh and all other reformist scholars,
along with a host of other prisoners, had already been sent to the Con Son Island
penal colony before Klobukowski arrived in Indochina. For the French, the
possibility of working with the reformists was never considered as an option.
Like the tax and administrative regime established by Paul Doumer, the protect-
orate scheme established by Paul Bert was firmly fixed in the French idea of
Indochina and never abandoned. Among the French was a paralyzing fear that
any major restructuring of the colonial relationship could lead to the loss of a
privileged position that had been achieved after decades of effort.
But while the dismissal of any questioning of existing policy was instinctive
among the French in Indochina, matters looked differently from the vantage of
Paris. There, in the wake of the events of1908, a lively debate ensued among
politicians over colonial policy in Indochina. The debate was focused on the
merits of an associationist policy that would ostensibly promote the material well
being of colonized people and open space for Vietnamese cultural development
in“association” with the French colonial government. The idea of association
was abstract and disconnected from colonial realities, but it was adopted as
official policy and led to the appointment as governor general of a prominent
politician, Albert Sarraut (1872–1962). Sarraut was from an influential family in
the newspaper business and had the gift of speaking with persuasive eloquence.
He served in Indochina from November1911 to January1914 and from January
1917 to May 1919. During his three-year absence for reasons of health, three

successive colonial administrators took his place without distinguishing them-
selves in any discernible way. Consequently, the second decade of the twentieth
century is generally known as the Sarraut era in Indochinese history. He inspired
a significant effort to arouse Vietnamese enthusiasm for French rule.
Aside from minor initiatives in medical services and education, Sarraut’s
contribution to the history of Indochina lay in his promotion of a new formula-
tion of Vietnamese tradition. He invited Vietnamese intellectuals to explore and
define a Vietnamese culture that could exist in harmonious association with
French rule. What this meant in practice was the cultivation of a narrowly
Confucianized version of Vietnamese culture that stressed social order and
obedience to hierarchy. As the examination system and character writing were
abandoned, the Vietnamese alphabet was mobilized to create a new medium for
cultural dissemination. Under Sarraut, the government of Indochina actively
supported the publication of vernacular books and journals to develop the aura
of a traditional Vietnamese identity that was indebted to French rule for its
continued survival amidst the tumults of the modern world.
Frenchmen sympathetic with a conservative and romanticized vision of Viet-
namese culture joined with groups of cooperative Vietnamese in organizations
such as“The Association of Friends of Old Hue” and “The League of Friends of
Annam” to propagate the theme of Franco-Vietnamese friendship among both
educated Vietnamese and enlightened French colons. Sarraut’s administration
subsidized Vietnamese journals to promote a colonial version of Vietnamese
tradition. For example, in the journalNam Phong(South Wind), Pham Quynh
(1892–1945) argued in 1918 that the example of French literature made it
possible to identify Nguyen Du’s Kim Van Kieu (The Tale of Kieu) as the
masterpiece of Vietnamese literature and that until the coming of the French
the significance of this work in Vietnamese culture had not been appreciated.
This initiated a debate among Vietnamese in which, among other things, it was
asserted that Pham Quynh adored this work because it romanced the virtues of a
prostitute, of which in serving the French he was one.
In opening vernacular writing to the issue of cultural, and inevitably national,
identity, Sarraut and his assistants wagered that the French could retain control
of the discussion. Within a decade, however, they were proven wrong when in
the mid1920s a new generation of Vietnamese began to challenge the French
version of Vietnamese identity. Nevertheless, the Confucianized version of Viet-
namese tradition that was fostered during the Sarraut era became a major force
in the thinking of later Vietnamese nationalists of all ideological persuasions. It
linked in their minds an outmoded cultural tradition with a hated colonial
regime, overtly manifested in the mandarins of the protectorate, and it gave a
sharp edge to the need for a new vision of national society and culture.

Sarraut’s rhetorical fervor for Franco-Vietnamese friendship was nestled in
the wartime urgency of France fighting desperately year after year against
German invaders. With most French and the best Vietnamese military units
deployed to Europe, French administrators in Indochina perceived them-
selves to be vulnerable to the vicissitudes of endemic Vietnamese resistance.
Despite this perception, the series of a nti-French episodes that occurred
during the Sarraut era demonstrate that the French regime was strong
enough to easily dispose of any opposition and that anti-French movements
were localized and disconnected from each other. The parade of events that
unnerved the French during this time nevertheless reveals that the colonial
regime had stimulated opposition from constituencies in nearly all parts of
the Vietnamese realm.
Domestic ferment with Europe at war
In1911, inspired by the Chinese revolution, Phan Boi Chau organized the
Vietnamese Restoration Society (Viet Nam Quang Phuc Hoi) in southern China
and endeavored to rebuild a network of activists in Tonkin. The only results of
this were some assassinations and bombings in1913, which attracted the atten-
tion of French security agents who pressured the new Chinese government to
cease encouraging Phan Boi Chau’s group. Phan Boi Chau subsequently spent
three years,1914–1917, in a Chinese jail.
Luong Ngoc Quyen (1890–1917), an early follower of Phan Boi Chau who
had studied in Japan and was active in the Restoration Society, was arrested in
Hong Kong in1915 and extradited to Hanoi. Charged with complicity in a1913
bomb attack, he was imprisoned at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, sixty-five
kilometers north of Hanoi. The senior French official at Thai Nguyen had
alienated local townspeople and soldiers in the Vietnamese garrison with his
odious behavior. At the end of August1917, the garrison mutinied, led by
Vietnamese sergeants, who freed the prisoners, some of whom had been follow-
ers of Hoang Hoa Tham in the nearby mountains. The soldiers, prisoners, and
local townspeople, led by Luong Ngoc Quyen and a sergeant named Trinh Van
Can, hastily fortified Thai Nguyen but within a few days French forces retook the
town after heavy fighting in which Luong Ngoc Quyen died. Large numbers of
the Vietnamese resisters, including Trinh Van Can, escaped to the mountains
where the last of them were cornered and eliminated during the following six
months. This uprising was the most spectacular anti-colonial event with some
connection, however indirect, to Phan Boi Chau’s activities. It demonstrated that
people of various classes could be provoked to unite against the French.

The construction of the Hanoi–Yunnan railroad brought distress to the people
who lived along the line by demands for labor and supplies. In late1914 and
early 1915, inhabitants in the region of Yen Bay, about halfway between Hanoi
and the Yunnan border, openly resisted French authority. They had no modern
weapons and were soon subjugated. By this time, railroads had already been
constructed between Hanoi and Lang Son on the Guangxi border of China and
between Hanoi and Vinh. Railroads had also been completed between Hue and
Da Nang and between Nha Trang and Saigon. Hue would be connected by rail
to Vinh in1927 and to Nha Trang in1936. The development of the railroad
network in Indochina introduced a new class of Vietnamese who worked to
maintain and operate the lines and the trains. Many men returning from France
after the First World War had acquired skills that led to their employment in the
railroad system, as well as in shipyards, mines, and factories. The railroad system
was a matter of pride for the French and, although it did not turn a profit until
after completion of the Hanoi–Saigon connection in the late1930s, it promoted
economic growth and connectivity among the Vietnamese regions. It also
aroused among Vietnamese an experience of travel and an awareness of wider
horizons that contributed substance to nationalist ideas that were beginning to
take form at this time.
In Cochinchina, popular movements based on the leadership of charismatic
religious figures had produced a series of anti-French disturbances in the1860s,
1870s, and1880s. This tendency toward what has been called peasant politics in
the guise of millenarian enthusiasm took strength from the large population of
landless wage laborers in rural Cochinchina who existed in precarious economic
conditions and from a rejection of the Buddhism espoused by the monks in richly
endowed and officially sanctioned temples that prospered in towns and cities. The
Seven Mountains region near the Vinh Te Canal on the Cambodian border in
western Cochinchina was the center of a series of Khmer–Viet religious fermenta-
tions out of which individuals, who were believed to have powers of healing and
magic, periodically emerged to organize and lead millennial uprisings against
established authority. Western Cochinchina was a reservoir for mobilizing this
volatile tradition of popular Buddhism and mass religious excitement that at times
spread easily into eastern Cochinchina where power sat in Saigon.
At the same time, many secret societies in the large Chinese immigrant com-
munities in Cochinchina, which are sometimes generally referred to as belonging
to the Heaven and Earth Society, were being Vietnamized. These societies were
organized for the purpose of mutual aid and often had a quasi-religious aspect.
Built into these societies were patron–client relationships in which wealthier
members looked after the welfare of the less fortunate in return for services
and loyalty.

In the early1910s, labor requirements for building roads and canals combined
with a heavy tax regime to put pressure on the realms of both millennial sectarian-
ism and mutual welfare secret societies. A young man named Phan Phat Sanh
(1892–1916), who was conversant with both of these realms, attracted followers
and made plans to brush aside the French with supernatural powers. Phan Phat
Sanh was reportedly the son of a policeman in the Chinese city of Cholon; he studied
mysticism, fortune telling, sorcery, geomancy, magic, and explosives in theSeven
Mountains and at Kampot, a short distance across the Cambodian border, where he
gained inspiration from an uprising that had occurred there in1909. He proclaimed
himself a Buddha and an emperor with the title Phan Xich Long (Phan the Red
Dragon) and in March1913 prepared to attack the centers of colonial government
in Saigon. He was arrested and his bombs were discovered and defused. Neverthe-
less, some six hundred of his rural adherents invaded Saigon armed with amulets
and primitive weapons. They were easily dispersed, but the French were unnerved
by such bold, albeit ineffectual, defiance. By coincidence, it was at this same time
that Cuong De was clandestinely visiting his wealthy landlord supporters in Cochin-
china. He managed to get away ahead of French security agents, but the French
associated the Phan Phat Sanh uproar with him and with the1913 assassins and
bomb throwers in Tonkin sent by Phan Boi Chau’s Restoration Society. They
neglected to address the causes of rural distress in Cochinchina that had put force
behind Phan Phat Sanh’s movement.
In the years that followed, conditions in Cochinchina were aggravated by coercive
recruitment of men to serve in wartime France. Compared with northern Annam
where large numbers of men freely volunteered, in Cochinchina there was little
enthusiasm. Consequently, French authorities resorted to harsh measures, which
simply added to popular resentment against them. When news about the siege of
Verdun spread through rural Cochinchina in early1916 along with hopeful rumors
that the French were about to be defeated, a series of local uprisings culminated in a
small invasion of Saigon by peasants intent upon breaking into the central prison
where Phan Phat Sanh was incarcerated. As in1913, these riots posed no serious
threat to the French, but Phan Phat Sanh was executed as a precaution against future
unrest. In the distinctive social, cultural, and economic situation of Cochinchina,
popular religion and mutual aid societies continued to be important for the Viet-
namese population most affected by direct French rule and within a few years would
inspire the rise of new and enduring religions.
Meanwhile, the monarchy continued to figure in the anti-colonial schemes of
some Vietnamese and became the focus of a plot that broke into the open a few
weeks after the1916 ripple of uprisings in Cochinchina. The16-year-old King
Duy Tan resented being supervised by his elderly regents and by the French who
stood behind them and in1915 caused concern in both groups by speaking out

against what he viewed as French looting of his dynasty’s ancestral treasures and
French violations of the protectorate agreement. French authorities interpreted
his outbursts as adolescent angst and aimed to calm him with a royal wedding
ceremony in January1916. But his attitude also reflected the views of some
members of his retinue, and he remained susceptible to ideas for taking advan-
tage of the European war to obtain concessions from the French.
One person with such ideas was Tran Cao Van (1866–1916). He was an
educated man from a village near Dien Ban in Quang Nam who had a varied
career in the1880s and1890s as keeper of a Daoist temple, geography teacher,
geomancer, and participant in a minor anti-French uprising before retiring to the
obscurity of his home village at the turn of the century. In1908 he was arrested
and sent to the penal colony on Con Son Island in the wake of the disturbances of
that year. Released in1913, he returned to Quang Nam and subsequently made
contact with the Restoration Society network that extended into central Annam
via Siam and linked activists with sympathizers among Vietnamese soldiers in
garrisons extending from Hue to Quang Ngai.
In early 1916 there happened to be at Hue a large encampment of recruits
being trained prior to embarkation for France. The news of war in Europe was
bleak, and morale among the recruits was low. Arms and supplies were accumu-
lating to accompany the men aboard ship. Tran Cao Van saw an opportunity to
mobilize soldiers and recruits to initiate an uprising that might inspire Vietnam-
ese in other parts of Indochina. He met clandestinely with Duy Tan, who agreed
to play his part in the plan. However, in early May1916 when Duy Tan fled the
palace to join plotters in the mountains, the French had already learned of the
scheme. Duy Tan was seized a few kilometers outside of Hue, and most Viet-
namese soldiers were disarmed and confined. Tran Cao Van was executed with
other leaders of the plot.
Duy Tan was sent, with his mother, wife, and sister, to join his father, the
former king Thanh Thai, who had been living in confinement at Vung Tau since
1907. Later in1916, the two former kings and their families were exiled to the
island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. Within days of Duy Tan’s arrest, a new
king was enthroned. This was Khai Dinh (1885–1925), a son of Dong Khanh,
who had sat on the throne from1885 to 1889. Like his father, he was a willing
collaborator with the French, and from then the monarchy offered no further
worry to colonial authorities.
The Indochina prison system tended to nurture anti-colonial activism because
it brought together potentially disaffected people from all Vietnamese regions
and encouraged a radical attitude toward the regime. The various prisons mani-
fested a great variety of conditions depending upon time and place, upon the
degree of isolation from the non-prison population, and upon the personal

qualities of administrators. These factors were all part of the February1918
disturbance on the Con Son Island penal colony. During the early years of the First
World War when France was overwhelmed by a sense of emergency, a relatively
lenient prison director had moderated the potential for insubordination by giving
prisoners certain freedoms that included participation in the local island economy
outside the prison walls. After the United States joined the Allies and the warbegan
to turn against Germany, this man was replaced by a disabled veteran of the Battle
of Verdun who instituted a more disciplined and harshly punitive regime. The
reaction among prisoners against this change was easily repressed, but thebriefly
violent event demonstrated that prison populations lived in an overtly confronta-
tional relationship with French authority where the colonial situation was devoid of
euphemism and where Sarraut-style idealism could not penetrate.
A combination of abstract expressions of Franco-Vietnamese friendship and of
an underworld of easily suppressed anti-colonial resistance characterized the
years during which France was locked in a dire struggle with German invaders.
The French had no capacity for administrative or economic initiative at this time
and could do little more than resort to eloquent blandishments, of which Albert
Sarraut was a master. For their part, the Vietnamese were incapable of any
unified response to French rule and could do little more than respond to local
grievances and episodic opportunities. However, after the war, Indochina
bustled with a developing economy driven by the high tide of French investment;
with a growing class of workers in mines, factories, shipyards, railroads, and
plantations; with a vigorous expansion of vernacular journalism and publishing;
with Vietnamese efforts to obtain greater participation in government; and with
the emergence of a generation of youth that began to experiment with new forms
of anti-colonial organization.
The beginning of Saigon politics
One of the publishing ventures subsidized by the Sarraut government was a
French-language Saigon newspaper,La Tribune Indigène, begun in1917, which
soon became the mouthpiece of Bui Quang Chieu (1872–1945), a man from the
Mekong delta who in the1890s had studied in France and obtained a degree in
agricultural engineering. From1897 he was employed by the colonial govern-
ment as an agricultural expert at various assignments in Indochina. He became a
French citizen and eventually owned extensive Mekong ricelands. By the mid
1910s, he had developed a network of acquaintances among Vietnamese admin-
istrators, businessmen, landowners, and intellectuals who were keen to give
substance to Sarraut’s rhetoric. He was especially concerned to expand

Vietnamese involvement in economic enterprise as the basis of promoting par-
ticipation in colonial politics. He was active in organizing mutual aid societies in
which Vietnamese could pool their resources for business initiatives. One of his
early collaborators had, at My Tho in1915, built the first Vietnamese-owned
rice mill to compete with the Chinese businesses that monopolized the rice trade.
Bui Quang Chieu believed that, fixated on the fossilized protectorate, the French
were perpetuating lamentable aspects of traditional Vietnamese government. He
called for an independent judiciary; for fewer, more professional, and better-paid
administrators; and for the elimination of the large numbers of underlings who fed
from the scraps of the regime. He also advocated opening the naturalization
process for more Vietnamese to become citizens, thereby conferring rights
enabling greater participation in public debate and politics, and he furthermore
favored expanding the electorate for Vietnamese seats on the Cochinchina Colonial
Council. However, these proposals did not interest Sarraut who, in his last years as
governor general, gave more attention to laying a basis for modern higher educa-
tion by abolishing the examination system and reopening the University of Hanoi,
which had been closed during the disturbances of1908.
In late summer1919, shortly after Sarraut departed Indochina, an opportunity
arose for Bui Quang Chieu to combine his economic and political goals when
protests broke out against Chinese business monopolies in Saigon. Bui Quang
Chieu and his friends called for a boycott of Chinese retail businesses, organized
a commercial society that established the first Vietnamese-owned bank, and
endeavored to open a congress for economic development in Cochinchina.
Many French administrators were sympathetic, but they could not act against
Chinese business without undermining the entire colonial economy. As for the
Vietnamese, despite small bursts of enthusiasm, the task of displacing Chinese
business was too monumental to even comprehend, and the boycott campaign
faded away by the time a new governor general, Maurice Long (1866–1923),
arrived in February1920.
Long was a liberal politician who had supported Sarraut ’s ideas about
developing Franco-Vietnamese cooperation. Although he proved to be a cautious
administrator, he nevertheless did push forward a reform of the Cochinchina
Colonial Council that increased Vietnamese representation from six to ten,
increased French representation from twelve to fourteen, and expanded the
number of Vietnamese eligible to vote from less than2,000 to around20,000.
The people gathered around Bui Quang Chieu’s agenda, collectively known as
Constitutionalists, included Nguyen Phan Long (1889–1960), who since1920 had
edited the newspaperL’Écho Annamite. After Bui Quang Chieu, he became the
most prominent of the Constitutionalists. Although he had argued against the
electoral reform on the basis that it would open politics to irresponsible people

without social standing, he was ironically elected in the autumn1922 election, the
first to be held under the new law.
The Council had been established in the1880s and was the center of power for
French colons in Cochinchina. Vietnamese members of the Council, with few
exceptions, had for decades simply followed the French and competed for the
benefits of doing that. The1922 reform, however, led to Constitutionalists
winning seats on the Council and speaking out against the most notoriously
corrupt practices of the administration. Their élitism and the opposition of
French colons would confound their efforts to play a leading role in the emerging
Vietnamese politics of the1920s and 1930s, but during the years1923–1926
they opened a door for the younger generation.
Other initiatives of Long were a minor expansion of opportunities for Viet-
namese in colonial administration and a significant expansion of primary and
secondary education in Cochinchina. Realizing that his government could not
meet the demand for education, he allowed new private schools to open. How-
ever, the driving force of French policy in Indochina was now the flow of
investment that became a flood after the1922 Marseille Colonial Exposition.
Long was replaced not by a politician susceptible to Sarraut’s thought but by a
career colonial administrator fresh from over fifteen years’experience governing
French colonies in Africa, Martial Henri Merlin (1860–1935). Merlin, governor
general from August1922 to April1925, ended the era of Sarrautian idealism with
a determination to enforce a disciplined calm to facilitate economic development.
He revealed his priorities in1924 when he rolled back Long’s educational reforms,
which he considered unnecessary. French colons welcomed his attitude, and
during his tenure they pushed back at the dream of Franco-Vietnamese friendship
that threatened their position of racial superiority. This exacerbated tensions as
Constitutionalists publicly dissented in the Council, uncensored Francophone
newspapers proliferated, and a new generation of Vietnamese came of age.
In the decade following the end of the First World War, investment in Indochina
was more than fifteen times what it had been during the preceding three decades.
As automobiles spread around the world, Indochinese rubber production
increased by more than thirty times in the1920s, and the number of workers on
rubber plantations increased from fewer than3,000 to more than80,000. Coal
production increased nearly300 percent. The annual number of applications for
mining licenses increased by a factor of thirty-five. By1929, more than85,000
people were employed in textile factories. Many new industries that manufactured
goods for local consumption were developed. The export of rice doubled.
This happened to be the time when the first generation of Vietnamese students to
be educated in French rather than in Literary Chinese became politically active.
During the first half of the1920s, members of this generation began to gather

around the Constitutionalists in Saigon. They came to be known as the Jeune
(young) Annam movement, which was more radical than the Constitutionalists
but developed confidence in public activism under the patronage of prominent
Constitutionalists. The most active Jeune Annam figure was Nguyen An Ninh
(1900–1943), who in1923 returned from three years of studying law in France to
edit La Cloche Fêlée, a newspaper that vented his passionate opposition to the
colonial regime.
The emergence of the Constitutionalists and the Jeune Annam activists
occurred during a particularly notorious time in the government of Cochinchina
under the leadership of Maurice Cognacq (1870–1949), governor from1921 to
1926. Cognacq’s circle of cronies included corrupt businessmen and professional
thugs. His chief of police was the discredited administrator who had provoked
the1917 Thai Nguyen mutiny and who had subsequently made a fortune in the
alcohol monopoly. Cognacq was prone to outrageous statements that exacer-
bated Franco-Vietnamese tensions.
As for Merlin, other than his reputation for dashing cold water on hopes
inspired by Sarraut, he became most famously known for narrowly escaping
unharmed from a bomb thrown in1924 by a young Vietnamese during a
banquet in the British concession at Guangzhou in southern China. He departed
Indochina in April1925, just before a series of events fundamentally altered the
Franco-Vietnamese relationship.
In retrospect, it may be tempting to imagine that in the early1920s there was a
moment of opportunity for the French to follow up and build on the enthusiasm
for Franco-Vietnamese collaboration elicited by Sarraut. It is plausibly true that
this was the last time that political concessions might have turned Indochinese
politics away from confrontation and stalemate. But, it is also true that the racist
attitude of the French colons and the degree to which colonial administration
served the interests of investment made such concessions very improbable. The
Sarraut magic was not meant for real life, but before the hopes it inspired finally
died, there was a brief but fateful resurgence of expectancy in1925 when
Alexandre Varenne (1870–1947) was appointed governor general.
Cochinchina and the new generation
A leftist coalition was elected to power in France in1924. It included many
politicians opposed to colonialism, which led in1925 to the replacement of
Merlin by Varenne, a Socialist politician who had expressed sympathy for
Vietnamese aspirations. Although disowned by his own party for accepting the
colonial appointment, Varenne believed that he should do what he could to

apply his political beliefs to the Indochinese situation. However, between
Merlin’s departure in April and Varenne’s arrival in November, a series of
unprecedented events had begun to change the political atmosphere in Indo-
china, and Varenne was immobilized between Vietnamese hope and French
colon fear.
The shift in French politics encouraged Phan Chu Trinh to return to Indochina
after fourteen years of voluntary exile in France that had followed his release
from prison in1911. He arrived in Saigon in June1925. Shortly after, Phan Boi
Chau was arrested by French agents in China and brought to Hanoi to stand
trial. Suddenly, the two major figures of the older generation who had chosen
exile over living under French colonialism were back in the country. Fresh from
the outside world, the venerable voices of Phan Chu Trinh, in public lectures, and
Phan Boi Chau, speaking in his defense during his trial, woke many Vietnamese
from the mental somnolence induced by living under the French regime.
In addition to these Vietnamese voices from the past, the dissonant voices of
angry Frenchmen filled Saigon newspapers during the summer of1925. André
Malraux (1901–1976), a French writer accused of stealing antiquities while
adventuring in Cambodia, conceived a repugnance for the colonial regime and,
taking the side of his Vietnamese friends in the Jeune Annam movement, pub-
lished a Saigon newspaper calledIndochine, in which he denounced colonialism
and engaged in a public feud with Governor Cognacq. The two men traded
public insults until Cognacq managed to shut down Malraux’s newspaper by
intimidating the printers. This spectacle of verbal battle between Frenchmen
inspired Vietnamese observers to imagine that times were changing, particularly
since one of the combatants was the despised Cochinchinese governor.
While waiting for the new governor general to arrive, the French were also
waiting and preparing for the death of King Khai Dinh, who had suffered from
spinal tuberculosis for several years. His health declined rapidly from mid
summer, and he died in early November. His12-year-old heir, Bao Dai, was
studying in Europe. The French decided to leave him in Europe to complete his
studies and meanwhile to administer the protectorate without a king. The
monarchy had already become an object of derision, not only among the reform-
ists of the old generation like Phan Chu Trinh, but even more generally among
the younger generation. Yet, the absence of a king in the country was unprec-
edented and gave edge to a sensation of passing into a new era.
Within two weeks of Khai Dinh’s death, Varenne arrived in Saigon and was
immediately pressured to respond to Vietnamese expectations by Nguyen Phan
Long, who met with him and presented an itemization of reforms. Under counter-
vailing pressure from the French colons, Varenne equivocated and proceeded
to Hanoi where Phan Boi Chau had just been sentenced to life imprisonment

with hard labor. Although Varenne decided to pardon the old foe of France and
allow him to retire to Hue under house arrest, this did not dispel the hardening
Vietnamese perception of the new governor general as unwilling or unable to
initiate change, and disappointment rapidly spread.
Shortly after Varenne’s arrival, Malraux began publishing a new newspaper
called Indochine Enchaîné, in which he renewed his verbal duel with Cognacq.
At the same time, Nguyen An Ninh restarted hisLa Cloche Fêlée, which earlier
had ceased publication when he took a trip to France. He now became even more
critical of the French regime than he had been before.
Nguyen Phan Long’s L’Écho Annamite also registered chagrin at Varenne’s
pusillanimity, and Bui Quang Chieu, despairing of Varenne, went to France to
present his plan for reform directly to the government in Paris. He called for basic
civil liberties, expanded educational opportunities, administrative and judicial
reforms, greater Vietnamese representation in government, extension to Indo-
china of French labor legislation, and suppression of the alcohol monopoly.
Although he had friends among French politicians, Third Republic politics were
too fragile to bear the weight of such a program of reform, particularly since the
French colons in Indochina also had their allies among politicians in Paris and
they were at the same time calling for the recall of Varenne because he was not
firm enough toward the Vietnamese. Bui Quang Chieu’s trip was in vain.
During the early weeks of1926, Jeune Annam activists took up the cause of a
Vietnamese journalist being prosecuted for exposing the abuse of workers from
Tonkin and Annam at Cochinchina rubber plantations and rice farms. In late
March, they organized a public rally in Saigon. Tracts were distributed that
called for political action with rhetoric reminiscent of communist slogans in
Europe, and Nguyen An Ninh gave a rousing speech. He and two of his
associates were arrested a few days later. In subsequent weeks,La Cloche Fêlée
serially published Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto. While Nguyen Phan Long
and other Constitutionalists were dismayed by this radical turn, it propelled
youth into a new politics of the streets.
A few days after the rally, Bui Quang Chieu returned from his trip to France
and was met at the dockside by a crowd of Vietnamese showing their support for
his agenda and a crowd of French people demonstrating against him. He
scrambled away to avert an incident, and his later mild utterances discredited
him among the younger generation.
Meanwhile, Phan Chu Trinh died. In early April, Jeune Annam organized a
funeral procession through the streets of Saigon that included contingents of
students from all over Cochinchina. The efforts of authorities to punish students
for absenting classes and for wearing black armbands provoked an escalation of
school boycotts as students expanded their mourning of Phan Chu Trinh to

protest the harsh discipline and racist attitudes of their French teachers. Student
activism spread from Saigon to other cities in Cochinchina and, to a lesser extent,
in Annam and Tonkin. Unrest also spread to urban workers, who were embold-
ened to organize strikes to improve their salaries and working conditions.
Varenne restored a modicum of calm by enforcing public order, which
included the expulsion of insubordinate students from their schools, and by
sending Cognacq back to France, thereby removing what he viewed as a primary
cause of the disturbances in Cochinchina. Malraux was also induced to return to
France. The Jeune Annam movement had burst out of its Constitutionalist
chrysalis but began to lose its coherence as members scattered in various direc-
tions, taking with them commitments to resist the colonial state that found many
manifestations.
Some of the Jeune Annam activists with the means for travel went to France
where they studied and gained experience in anti-colonial politics. Some of these
returned to Indochina a few years later with commitments to communism in
either its Stalinist or Trotskyist version. For a few, Paris was a stop on the way
to Moscow and the embrace of the Third Communist International (Comintern),
which promised world revolution. Young Vietnamese in France during the1920s
increasingly organized anti-colonial propaganda activities, sometimes with the
support of sympathetic French people. Meanwhile, most Vietnamese of the new
generation had to come to terms with the reality of living in Indochina.
By 1926, the role of newspapers in expanding the realm of commentary on
public affairs had been clearly demonstrated. From then, a new generation of
aspiring journalists expressed their political aims through investigative reporting
to uncover corruption and abuse and through editorializing essays. Censorship
was less strict in Cochinchina than it was in Annam and Tonkin. It was also less
strict in the French language than in Vietnamese. Nevertheless, the emerging new
generation created a great surge of publishing in the alphabetic vernacular
throughout the Vietnamese regions of Indochina, not only of newspapers but
also of journals, books, and pamphlets. For example, between1923 and 1928
approximately sixty daily and weekly Vietnamese newspapers were started in
Indochina. Many had a relatively short life-span due to financial and censorship
problems, but they continued to appear. Journals that typically appeared
monthly or bi-monthly were produced on a wide range of topics. In1925 there
were around thirty-five Vietnamese journals; by1930 there were seventy-five.
The rush of the new generation into vernacular alphabetic print was a major
event. It was accompanied by an expansion of alphabetic literacy that in the
1930s enabled the emergence of new literary trends as well as the widespread
dissemination of political programs that crossed the boundaries separating the
three colonial jurisdictions of Vietnam.

After his release from prison and a trip to France, Nguyen An Ninh,withdrew
to his home village of Hoc Mon, a short distance northwest of Saigon, where in
1928he organized a secret revolutionary society with a network of adherents
numbering a few hundred. Within months, French authorities uncovered his
activities and he was returned to prison. His turn to the countryside appears to
have been partly influenced by an anarchist dream of“returning to the people.”
But he was also influenced by a new religion that had appeared in Cochinchina.
The popular Buddhist millennialism and the mutual-aid secret societies that had
contextualized the rural disturbances of1913 and 1916 had not disappeared.
Within ten years, the continuing distress of landless Cochinchinese peasants
combined with the altruism of sympathetic Vietnamese landlords and civil ser-
vants to create the Cao Dai religion. Cao Dai combined aspects of several reli-
gious, philosophical, and literary traditions from both Asia and Europe based on
messages received from the one deity that was believed to exist behind all religions.
Cao Dai operated through a hierarchy modeled on the Roman Catholic Church
and established communities that reified the landlord–tenant relationship into a
fellowship of believers. It was loosely associated with a constellation of secret
societies cum popular cults that were active in rural Cochinchina. It spread widely,
organizing rural communities and building temples. Its leaders erected an impres-
sive cathedral in Tay Ninh, around eighty kilometers northwest of Saigon.
Cao Dai was a model of Vietnamese banding together from various social
classes to address problems exacerbated by the colonial state. Its concern for
Vietnamizing rural society away from the economic exploitation of Chinese
business and the administrative indifference of French officials overlapped to
some extent with the aims of Constitutionalists. Nguyen Phan Long took a
strong interest in the new religion. Although the very existence of Cao Dai
expressed alienation from the colonial project, the French perceived no immedi-
ate threat to their authority and did not interfere with it.
The new generation in Tonkin and Annam
Activist members of the new generation in Tonkin, galvanized by the events of
1925–1926, gathered in Hanoi and were initially involved in publishing efforts. The
level of French surveillance and censorship, however, stymied them, and in Decem-
ber1927 they organized the Vietnamese Nationalist Party under the leadership of
Nguyen Thai Hoc (1902–1930). This organization was modeled on the Chinese
Nationalist Party, which for several years had been based in southern China. It was
of necessity a clandestine party but, spreading rapidly to include adherentsin nearly
all parts of Tonkin, it was soon infiltrated by French agents.

In Annam, people imprisoned after the1908 disturbances began to be released
in the1910s. At that time, some of them aimed to associate with Phan Boi Chau’s
Restoration Society, and they formed a clandestine organization, many members
of which resided at Vinh in Nghe An, Phan Boi Chau’s home province where his
in-country contacts were thickest. Students, teachers, and other members of the
new generation began to join in1926. This organization changed its name
several times through the years as it repeatedly redefined its aims and became
progressively more radical. It is usually referred to either as Phuc Viet, one of its
early names, to resonate with Phan Boi Chau’s Restoration (Quang Phuc) Society
or as Tan (“new”) Viet, one of its last names. Because of Phan Boi Chau’s
influence, it had connections with exiles in China, which it maintained even after
Phan Boi Chau’s capture. By1926 it was in contact with a group in southern
China known as the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, in which several
of its younger members had become active, and in1927 there was a failed effort
to merge the two organizations.
The Youth League had been formed in 1925 as part of the extensive
Comintern presence in Guangzhou to support the alliance between the Chinese
Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party in preparation for a joint
expedition against the warlords who dominated central and northern China.
Building on a group of young anti-French Vietnamese who had gathered in
southern China and led by a Comintern agent later known as Ho Chi Minh
(1890–1969), the Youth League was busy establishing networks in the Vietnam-
ese regions of Indochina, disseminating propaganda, and clandestinely bringing
young people to Guangzhou for training. Ho Chi Minh, originally from Nghe
An, came to China at the end of1924 after a year and a half in Moscow; prior to
that, he had spent several years in France, where he had participated in the
founding of the French Communist Party. The Youth League’s earliest and
strongest in-country connection was with the Vinh group, but, by1927, it had
also established a network in Cochinchina by tapping into what remained of the
Jeune Annam movement. In1927, the Youth League’s activities were disrupted
when civil war broke out between the Chinese Nationalists and the Chinese
Communists, prompting Ho Chi Minh to flee back to Moscow.
By early 1928, the Youth League had leadership committees in all three
Vietnamese regions and a central committee located in Hong Kong. During the
next two years, the Hanoi committee began to follow an independent line. It was
competing with Nguyen Thai Hoc’s Nationalist Party for followers and by late
1929 had gained influence over that party’s “leftist” wing. It was also susceptible
to influences from within the Chinese Communist Party through its members in
the local Chinese community and cross-border contacts. The rise of Li Lisan
within the leadership of the Chinese party at this time contributed to the Hanoi

committee’s growing alienation from the Youth League’s Central Committee,
which appeared relatively passive in comparison with Li Lisan’s efforts to pro-
mote a revolutionary upsurge. Furthermore, the1928 Sixth Comintern Congress
held in Moscow marked a shift toward greater emphasis on class struggle, an
issue on which the Hanoi committee members considered that they were more
correct than the Central Committee.
In 1929, the Youth League split into two competing communist parties, one
based in Hanoi and the other with most of its strength in Cochinchina. In early
1930, Ho Chi Minh arrived in Hong Kong following his escape to Europe and a
sojourn in the Vietnamese community of northeastern Siam. He summoned repre-
sentatives from both parties and papered over the schism to form a united party to
which the Tan Viet group of Annam subsequently adhered as well. Problems
remained, however, and the Comintern was not satisfied with what Ho Chi Minh
had achieved. Tran Phu (1904–1931), an early recruit of the Youth League from
Ha Tinh who had meanwhile arrived from Moscow with fresh instructions,
chaired the“first plenum” of the new party in October 1930 at which the
Indochinese Communist Party was inaugurated as the Comintern arm for the
French colonial state. After Comintern assignments in China, Ho Chi Minh
suffered a brief imprisonment in Hong Kong, and then, in1934,h ea g a i nr e t u r n e d
to Moscow, where he spent the next four years. While the formation of the
Indochinese Communist Party was the work of exiles working in an international
organization, much of its energy and capacity to operate inside the colonial state
came from movements that grew up within Indochina: the Tan Viet of Annam, the
Jeune Annam of Cochinchina, and the Nationalist Party of Tonkin.
What was apparent by the end of the1920s was that Vietnamese were not
confined to the colonial relationship. Young anti-colonial activists of both
reformist and revolutionary persuasions traveled, lived, learned, organized or
were being organized in China, France, and the Soviet Union, and they brought
their new ideas and skills back to Indochina. Their parents’generation had been
oppressed with a sense of having“lost” their country, which had been reinforced
by Social Darwinist thought arriving via Chinese translations of European
books. But this generation learned European languages and had knowledge
and experience of parliamentary democracy, electoral politics, anarchism, print
activism, Comintern communism, and Trotskyist communism, all of which
contextualized the colonial relationship in a world of wider possibilities. In the
1920s, the French colonial authorities lost the attention of the younger gener-
ation of Vietnamese. In the early1930s, the consequences of this forced the
French regime into a defensive stance, from which it never regained the initiative.
Events in Cochinchina, driven by influences from France, had stimulated the
politicization of young Vietnamese in the mid1920s. However, it was in Tonkin

and northern Annam, where French idealism was less plausible and where
exposure to the political cultures of China was more compelling, that a fateful
crossover into violence occurred.
During 1928, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party led by Nguyen Thai Hoc was
expanding its organization among educated youth, workers, and soldiers in
Tonkin. Nguyen Thai Hoc’s ideological orientation was rather vaguely defined
by the“three principles”– national unity, democracy, and social welfare– of the
revolutionary leader who founded the Chinese Nationalist Party, Sun Yatsen
(1866–1925), and by the French revolutionary motto of“liberty, equality, and
solidarity.” Despite efforts to maintain a clandestine profile, the arousal of eager
but undisciplined revolutionaries severely challenged organizational control and
created a vulnerability to French surveillance. Furthermore, the Tonkin commit-
tee of the Youth League was competing with the Vietnamese Nationalist Party
for recruits. Negotiations to merge the two organizations failed because they
could not agree on the issues of class-based politics and adherence to a foreign-
led organization.
In February 1929, a rogue member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party,
seeking to prove his party’s anti-colonial prowess to those tempted to join the
Youth League, defied his party’s instructions and assassinated a Frenchman,
Hervé Bazin. Bazin was in charge of recruiting laborers from Tonkin, often
through trickery or coercion, for plantations in Cochinchina and New Caledo-
nia. His death provoked the French to arrest several hundred Nationalist Party
members, including most of the central leadership. Several members of the Youth
League were also swept up in the arrests, which continued throughout the year.
Nguyen Thai Hoc escaped and tried to rebuild the party, but finally concluded
that there was no time to do this and that an insurrection was the only way to
stave off disaster.
This was also a critical time in the fortunes of Chinese and Vietnamese
adherents of the Comintern. In December1928, struggle over leadership of the
Youth League in Cochinchina had resulted in homicide, the so-called Rue
Barbier Affair, triggering a wave of arrests that crippled the southern committee
of the Youth League. Furthermore, in1929 the split in the Youth League broke
open with the Hanoi-based committee responding to the Li Lisan leadership in
the Chinese Communist Party.
The Chinese communists, endeavoring tosurvive Chinese Nationalist Party
efforts to destroy them, were building military bases in remote places, which
they called soviets. In1929, hostilities erupted in Guangxi, just north of the
border, between Chinese Nationalist forces and Chinese Communist forces.
Defeated, the Chinese communists led by Deng Xiaoping withdrew upriver
into the mountains north of the Cao Bang border where, from December1929

to February 1930 they organized uprisings and formed soviets. These soviets,
the Youjiang Soviet at Baise and the Zuojiang Soviet at Longzhou, existed for
about six months, during the first half of1930. Some Vietnamese who were
residing in the area or serving with Chinese Communist forces were involved
in these events.
At the same time, Ho Chi Minh was in Hong Kong bringing together the Youth
League factions to form a united Vietnamese Communist Party. The unification
of Vietnamese communist organizations simultaneous with the appearance of
Chinese communist soviets on the Vietnamese border increased enthusiasm for
action among party members in Tonkin and northern Annam. When French
military forces were deployed to help suppress the Chinese soviets, Vietnamese
communists were tempted to assist their Chinese allies by distracting French
attention back to Indochina.
This temptation was particularly strong because the leader of the Chinese
Communist Party at this time, Li Lis an, was advocating that communist
parties throughout Asia should implement general uprisings. The central
leadership of the Vietnamese CommunistParty initially hesitated to follow
the Li Lisan line because it seemed to be at odds with Comintern policy. But
the line was also being conveyed to Vietnamese through Chinese Communist
Party members among overseas Chinese in Indochina, particularly in Cochin-
china. Furthermore, Vietnamese communists were unavoidably involved
in the protests, strikes, and insurrections that broke out in the Vietnamese
parts of Indochina at the beginning of1930 and that continued for more than
ay e a r .
The unrest and violence of1930–1931 arose first of all from the politicization
of youth in the mid1920s, which began a general shift in Vietnamese attitudes
toward the French. Varenne’s failure to surmount the colonial regime’s resistance
to change brought an end to the Sarraut dream. Aside from confirmed élitists,
such as the Constitutionalists, and those attached to the Hue monarchy, Viet-
namese increasingly lost interest in cooperating with the French. Instead of being
a potential mentor or partner for developing structures of reform, self-
government, and autonomy, the French had become an obstacle to the aspir-
ations of young Vietnamese.
Consequently, Vietnamese inclined toward public activism, whether among
workers or peasants, soldiers or intellectuals, having lost their respect for the
French, and without alternate paths toward their goals, dared to stand up in
demonstrations, strikes, and uprisings. In particular, labor unrest on plantations
and factories grew in the late1920s to reach a crescendo in1930 with labor
strikes throughout Vietnamese Indochina that mobilized hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of workers at a time.

The soviets in Nghe-Tinh and western Cochinchina
Aside from the change in Vietnamese perceptions arising from the obduracy of
the French regime that affected all Vietnamese regions, Tonkin was particularly
responsive to developments in southern China that inspired Vietnamese efforts to
build clandestine anti-colonial organizations modeled on the Chinese Commun-
ist and the Chinese Nationalist Parties. In late1929, Nguyen Thai Hoc, the
leader of the most volatile and vulnerable of these organizations, the Nationalist
Party, was running on a very short fuse of desperation, barely keeping ahead of
the arrests that were ruining his party even as he made plans for an insurrection.
The Nationalist Party was disintegrating under the pressure of French repres-
sion and the turning of some members toward the Communist Party when the
uprising was triggered in early February1930. A mutiny in the Vietnamese
garrison at Yen Bay and uncoordinated uprisings around Tonkin were quickly
suppressed. Nguyen Thai Hoc and most of his party’s leadership were arrested
and eventually executed. The French repression in Tonkin destroyed the Nation-
alist Party, although some members escaped into Chinese exile. The Communist
Party in Tonkin was damaged but not destroyed. The demise of the Nationalist
Party and the disturbance it produced in Tonkin were but a prelude to the most
spectacular episode of anti-colonial action, which broke out at Vinh and its
hinterland in the Nghe-Tinh region of northern Annam.
All three regional communist organizations that had been theoretically united
following Ho Chi Minh’s intervention at the beginning of1930 were involved in
organizing and leading the demonstrations and strikes that reached a crescendo
in the month of April as the French bombed the Chinese soviets and exterminated
the Nationalist Party in Tonkin. However, because of the repression in Cochin-
china following the Rue Barbier Affair and in Tonkin following the Nguyen Thai
Hoc uprising, and because vigilant protectorate magistrates had minimized
communist influence in southern Annam, the only region in which the commun-
ist network was relatively strong and intact was northern Annam, in particular
the region of Vinh where the Tan Viet movement had been active for several
years and was most firmly embedded.
With Ho Chi Minh away on a Comintern assignment in Singapore and
Bangkok to assist in organizing Malayan and Siamese communist parties, a
group of leaders, most of whom were from the northern branch of the Vietnam-
ese Communist Party, met in Hanoi in April1930, calling themselves the“pro-
visional central committee.” This group, seemingly inspired by the Li Lisan line,
the Chinese soviets across the border, the strikes and demonstrations, and the
atmosphere of French repression in Tonkin, decided to organize an uprising in

Nghe-Tinh. Two men from Tonkin, Nguyen Phong Sac ( 1902–1931) and
Nguyen Duc Canh (1908–1932), were assigned to go to Vinh and implement
this plan.
Beginning in May, a campaign of peaceful demonstrations by peasants and
workers was initiated in Nghe-Tinh against excessive taxation and the colonial
salt monopoly. Within a few weeks, this campaign turned violent and local
administration began to disintegrate. By September, Nguyen Duc Canh and
Nguyen Phong Sac were organizing revolutionary governments in villages, which
came to be called soviets. During the next six months approximately thirty
soviets were organized in the Nghe-Tinh countryside. The manner in which these
soviets were organized reflected the methods espoused and taught by the Chinese
Communist Party about how to organize peasants. Efforts were also made to
organize soviets in southern Annam in the regions of Dong Hoi, Quang Tri, and
Quang Ngai but were unsuccessful.
It took the French nearly a year to put down what became known as the Nghe-
Tinh Soviets. Not trusting their Vietnamese soldiers, they employed military
units composed of upland minority groups and the French Foreign Legion. Even
with aerial bombardment and a policy of pillage and slaughter, it took months
for the French to begin to regain control of the Nghe-Tinh countryside. Mean-
while the“first plenum” of the Vietnamese Communist Party was convened in
Hong Kong in October. Despite the events in Nghe-Tinh, this meeting was
primarily occupied with putting the Comintern stamp on the new party,
changing its name to the Indochinese Communist Party and sidelining Ho Chi
Minh in favor of Tran Phu, who more faithfully espoused the ascendant Comin-
tern line in favor of class struggle. At the same time, the plenum went on record
as criticizing the Nghe-Tinh uprising and predicting its failure, this at a time
when the Comintern was moving against Li Lisan and his policy of general
uprisings.
When the “second plenum” was held at Saigon in March1931, Tran Phu
re-emphasized class struggle and the need to remove class enemies. The Nghe-
Tinh Soviets, in the last phase of being destroyed and led by increasingly radical
elements, translated this into a homicidal campaign against suspected informers,
those without revolutionary enthusiasm, and the wealthy. In April and May, the
top level of leadership in the soviets was arrested, including both Nguyen Phong
Sac and Nguyen Duc Canh. Tran Phu was also arrested at this time in Saigon. By
the end of summer the French had pacified Nghe-Tinh. By the end of the year,
nearly all the leaders of the Indochinese Communist Party had been arrested or
had fled, and the party was a shambles.
During the high tide of the Nghe-Tinh Soviet movement in late1930, a less
spectacular but, in the long term, more significant breakdown of colonial

authority occurred in rural Cochinchina, particular in western districts such as
Cao Lanh and Cho Moi where short-lived soviets were organized. Although
French security forces maintained general ascendancy, this was the beginning of
a gradual erosion of administrative control in parts of western Cochinchina that
continued for the next quarter-century until the French colonial effort finally
collapsed. Here, communist propaganda and organizing activities mixed with the
millenarian tendencies revealed most recently in the disturbances of1913 and
1916.I n 1931 and 1932, the French arrested many communist activists in
Cochinchina. Although a certain calm was restored, it was deceptive. The world-
wide depression severely damaged the rice export market and the potential for
political and religious excitement remained.
The French resort to the monarchy
For five years after the events of1930–1931, the Franco-Vietnamese relationship
was in a surface holding pattern while, beneath the calm, important changes
were occurring among the Vietnamese. The governor generals during this time
were men who had many years of administrative experience in Indochina and
had risen to high positions under Sarraut in the1910s. Pierre Marie Antoine
Pasquier (1877–1934) had been serving in Indochina since the1890s. He had
written and lectured extensively about Vietnamese culture, about which he was
well informed and with which he was sympathetic, and he had served as senior
administrator at Hue from1920 to 1927. When Varenne was recalled due to
pressure from the French colon lobby in1928, Pasquier was named governor
general. After Pasquier’s death in an airplane accident in1934, Eugène Jean
Louis René Robin (1872–1954) was appointed to succeed him. Robin had served
as senior administrator of Tonkin from1925 to 1930. Both Pasquier and Robin
were conservative and held the trust of French people in Cochinchina. Their
attitude toward the Vietnamese was paternalistic.
Pasquier sternly enforced the status quo while resorting to a recycling of old
solutions for new problems. With Sarraut-like rhetoric, he spoke admiringly of a
traditional Vietnamese culture and of France’s duty to preserve it. While this was
soothing to Vietnamese monarchists and conservatives, for many in the younger
generation it was a bad dream from an oppressive past, the glorification of the
worst features of their society, in particular the new colonial mandarinate and its
combination of old-fashioned Confucian values with modern administrative
coercive powers.
The traditional Vietnamese culture espoused by Pasquier was in large part a
colonial invention based on aspects of Confucianism that enforced gender and

age subordinations in family relations. It also fed from the aura of a venerable
antiquity with which the French invested the dynastic routine at“old Hue.”
Having spent most of the1920s overseeing the protectorate, Pasquier thought to
renew Paul Bert’s alliance with the monarchy as a way of regaining Vietnamese
interest in the colonial project.
After the death of King Khai Dinh in1925, when the French assumed direct
control of the protectorate government at Hue, there was a series of proposals
for reforming the monarchy. French colonial functionaries even drew up a draft
for something like a constitutional monarchy. Pham Quynh, whose career began
during Sarraut’s time as editor of a journal promoting the kind of traditional
culture espoused by Pasquier, was a prominent Vietnamese proponent of
returning administrative responsibilities to the monarchy. Other Vietnamese,
such as Nguyen Van Vinh (1882–1936), a journalist who started his career as
a French apologist during Sarraut’s time and became a translator of French
literature into Vietnamese, subscribed to Phan Chu Trinh’s disdain for the
monarchy and urged the French to brush aside the protectorate in order to
modernize the government.
The cabinet of royal ministers, although subdued by French supervision, was
not utterly supine. The most influential minister was Nguyen Huu Bai (1863–
1935). He was a Roman Catholic from Quang Tri who, educated by the Church,
entered public service in1884 when the Patenôtre protectorate treaty was put
into effect. He became the leading minister at court during the reign of Khai Dinh
(1916–1925). He welcomed Phan Boi Chau to Hue after his pardon in December
1925 and assured French authorities that no problems would ensue. But in the
years that followed, the French were increasingly irritated by his requests to
return Bao Dai from Europe and to re-establish the provisions of the Patenôtre
Treaty, which the French had superseded in1925. Beneath his loyalty to the
French was a staunch regard for an autonomous Vietnamese administration.
The French tended to interpret his attitude as out of date and as shielding the
corruptions and irrationalities that they considered to be the worst features of
Vietnamese magistrates.
One of Maurice Long’s initiatives in1920 was to establish an elected Vietnamese
consultative council for Annam; Sarrault had established such a council for Tonkin
in 1913. The electorate was extremely limited and the council’s sphere of activity
was severely restricted, but its profile was enhanced when Varenne redesigned the
Tonkin and Annam councils as“representative chambers” in 1926. Council
members began to add their voices to calls for a return to the Patenôtre Treaty being
made by Nguyen Huu Bai and his ministerial colleagues.
The French resolution that something needed to be done about the monarchy
was strengthened by the crisis of1930–1931, and ideas about reform came to be

focused on planning for Bao Dai’s return from Europe. As would again be the
case fifteen years later, the French turned to Bao Dai as a solution to their
alienation from the Vietnamese. However, when Bao Dai arrived in Hue in
September1932, French caution and differing Vietnamese agendas imposed an
inertia that was not broken for several months. Bao Dai,20 years old and fresh
from many years in Europe, was intelligent but indolent. Pham Quynh,40 years
old and a career propagandist for Franco-Vietnamese cooperation, was eager to
modernize the monarchy and willingly negotiated between French sensibilities
and Bao Dai’s kingly aspirations. Nguyen Huu Bai,70 years old and a lifelong
veteran of protectorate politics, became stubborn and, with senior members of
the royal family, did not want to let slip an opportunity for restoring a semblance
of real authority to the protectorate.
Finally, in May1933, Pasquier engineered a“coup” in which Nguyen Huu Bai
and his elderly colleagues were retired and replaced in the royal council of
ministers by younger men with Pham Quynh at their head. Despite the relatively
minor administrative, legal, and educational innovations that would be imple-
mented by the protectorate over the next few years, it was quickly apparent that
the French had no intention of relinquishing any authority to the monarchy, and
this contributed to the resignation of the Minister of the Interior, Ngo Dinh Diem
(1901–1963), after less than three months in office.
Like Nguyen Huu Bai, Ngo Dinh Diem came from a family that had been
Roman Catholic for many generations. His father had been a senior official at
Thanh Thai’s court and had retired to the countryside when Thanh Thai was
deposed in 1907. Ngo Dinh Diem entered protectorate administration after
graduating in1921 from the School of Public Administration and Law in Hanoi,
which prepared aspiring government officials in place of the abolished civil
service examination system. His eldest brother had preceded him into official-
dom and had married a daughter of Nguyen Huu Bai. Ngo Dinh Diem rapidly
ascended the ranks of office due to his honesty and his effectiveness in governing
rural areas, which impressed the French, and to the patronage of Nguyen Huu
Bai that was based on family connections. His father’s unhappy experience with
French treatment of the monarchy in1907 and Nguyen Huu Bai’s belief that
Pham Quynh was leading the monarchy deeper into the smothering French
embrace was the context of Ngo Dinh Diem’s disillusionment with the new
cabinet. His rapid rise in protectorate politics ended with his decision to never
again serve as a functionary of French rule. He spent the next decade in retire-
ment under French surveillance.
The policy of reforming the monarchy lapsed with Pasquier’s death in1934.
Robin, the new governor general, was not particularly interested in the mon-
archy. He was more concerned about what he viewed as the most fundamental

problem in Indochina, the pauperization of the peasantry that was exacerbated
by the effects of the worldwide depression. However, the economic structure of
Indochina resisted change, and during his short tenure (1934–1936) there was no
time to do more than talk. Furthermore, by the mid1930s, politics in France
were shifting to the left in response to the rise of fascism in Europe, bringing new
uncertainties to colonial administrators.
Vietnamese politics and the Popular Front
During the prolonged suppression of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and the
Nghe-Tinh Soviets, Vietnamese students and young professionals in France
organized protest demonstrations, resulting in many of their leaders being
arrested and expelled back to Indochina or evading arrest and escaping back to
Indochina. Most of these had participated in the Jeune Annam movement of the
mid1920s and had gone to France to avoid French measures against student
unrest following Phan Chu Trinh’s death in1926. Many became communists
while in France. Some adhered to the French Communist Party and a few of these
returned to Vietnam via Moscow and the Comintern network. Others became
followers of Leon Trotsky (1879–1940), the Bolshevik leader whom Stalin
expelled from public life in1927 and forced into exile in1929. Trotsky opposed
the bureaucratic and regimented version of state government and international
revolution espoused by Stalin and the Comintern. He proposed a radical faith in
the masses to ignite and sustain revolution in a less disciplined, more spontan-
eous, and more open-ended way than was the Stalinist style of strict obedience to
party leaders. In the1930s, Vietnamese Trotskyists became a driving force in
Cochinchinese politics with their emphasis on propagandizing and organizing
among workers in plantations, factories, shipyards, railyards, and arsenals.
Trotskyists first appeared in Cochinchina in1932, just in time to experience
the wave of arrests that snared Tran Phu and other communist leaders as the
Nghe-Tinh Soviets were being shut down. Resistant to party discipline, Trotsky-
ists tended toward the leadership of either Ta Thu Thau (1906–1945) or Ho Huu
Tuong (1910–1980), both of whom had been politicized in France. While Ta
Thu Thau was willing to cooperate with Stalinists to advance his political
program, Ho Huu Tuong believed that the Indochinese Communist Party could
not be trusted to place revolutionary priorities above either the national interests
of the Soviet Union or the temptation to make alliances with class enemies.
Most Trotskyists maintained informal working relationships with each other
while Ta Thu Thau was willing to do the same with Stalinists, which was
facilitated by the disarray of the Stalinist party. By the end of1932, the

Indochinese Communist Party had lost most of its leadership and no longer had a
functioning network of command. Nguyen Van Tao (1908–1970), a member of
the French Communist Party and an adherent of the Comintern, had been
expelled from France in1930 and became a close associate of Ta Thu Thau, as
did Duong Bach Mai (1905–1964), who in1932 arrived in Saigon from France
via a three-year sojourn in Moscow. Ta Thu Thau was also willing to work with
non-communist nationalists such as Tran Van Thach (1903–?), who was
expelled from France with Nguyen Van Tao and eventually became a
Trotskyist by the late1930s, and with independent revolutionaries and anarch-
ists such as Nguyen An Ninh. In the spring of1933, elections to the Saigon
Municipal Council provided a focus for cooperation.
The electorate for these elections was small and restricted to Vietnamese
already having some connection to the colonial government. Nevertheless, Ta
Thu Thau and his associates put forward a“workers’ list” of candidates and
briefly published a French-language newspaper calledLa Lutte(Struggle) to rally
support for it. Two members of this Struggle Group, Tran Van Thach and
Nguyen Van Tao, were elected. They were not allowed to take their council
seats, but their election indicated a sense of alienation from the French regime felt
even by Vietnamese most closely associated with it. The Vietnamese electorate
was familiar with the racist discrimination, arrogance, and brutality that per-
vaded the colonial regime, andLa Lutte aroused their intolerance of injustice.
Furthermore, the Struggle Group spoke for a wider spectrum of the population
than did other politically active Vietnamese. Previously, men closely associated
with French interests had dominated Cochinchinese elections until the Constitu-
tionalists rose to prominence in the mid1920s as a kind of loyal opposition. But,
Constitutionalists had limited appeal because of their élitism. Furthermore, in the
early1930s, they began to break into factions based on personality and gener-
ational change, with younger men believing that their senior colleagues had
become susceptible to corruption and were too comfortable in the French
embrace.
The Struggle Group disbanded after the election, but in the autumn of1934,
partly through the efforts of Nguyen An Ninh, it was reconstituted with an eye
toward elections in1935, and the newspaperLa Lutte began to be published
regularly. In the Cochinchina Colonial Council elections of March1935, can-
didates supported by the Struggle Group received 17 percent of the vote,
although none was elected. However, two months later, in the Saigon Munici-
pal Council elections, four of six candidates on the“workers’list” were elected:
Tran Van Thach, Nguyen Van Tao, Ta Thu Thau, and Duong Bach Mai. Of
these, only Tran Van Thach, ostensibly not a communist, was allowed to take
his seat.

By this time, the leftward shift of French politics was becoming palpable in
Indochina. The French Communist Party began to cooperate with the French
Socialist Party, and visiting parliamentary delegations included communists, who
spoke in favor of labor legislation and an amnesty for political prisoners. In the
summer of1935, reflecting Stalin’s concern about the rise of fascism, the Seventh
Comintern Congress in Moscow called on communist parties to join with anti-
fascists to form“popular front” governments. In the French elections of May
1936 a Popular Front government led by the French Socialist Party was voted
into power. This government included many politicians who were critical of
colonial policies and a parliamentary Committee of Inquiry was established with
plans for fact-finding visits to the colonies.
Announcement of the Committee of Inquiry prompted a campaign to organize
a congress in Saigon to formulate proposals to present to the committee when it
arrived. Prominent leaders of this so-called“democracy movement” included
members of the Struggle Group as well as Constitutionalists. However, when the
Struggle Group began to organize“action committees” at localities throughout
Cochinchina to select delegates to the Congress, many Constitutionalists
abandoned the movement, believing that it was becoming too radical. The
upsurge of activity surrounding the“action committees” and plans for the
proposed congress unnerved colonial authorities. In September1936 the French
announced that the Committee of Inquiry would not come to Indochina after all
and all further planning for the congress was banned.
In the same month, a new governor general arrived in Indochina. Joseph Jules
Brévié (1889–1964) had just served for six years as Governor General of French
West Africa. He had a reputation among colonial administrators as a liberal,
which apparently recommended him to the Popular Front government. During
his tenure, progressive labor legislation was enacted, amnesties released hundreds
of political prisoners, and there was a general loosening of censorship and restric-
tions on political activity. The Indochinese Communist Party was revived by the
release of prisoners, by new leadership arriving with fresh instructions from
Moscow, and by the opportunity to openly operate as a legal organization.
However, the popular front policy of the Comintern meant that the Indochinese
Communist Party was now allied with the French colonial regime against the
fascist threat, which seemed remote in Indochina, and this caused a certain amount
of confusion and consternation in anti-colonial ranks. The rebuilding of party
discipline under the watchful eye of the French Communist Party also brought an
end to Stalinist participation in the Struggle Group.
The Struggle Group held together through the May1937 Saigon Municipal
Council elections, in which three of its members were elected: Ta Thu Thau,
Nguyen Van Tao, and Duong Bach Mai. Thereafter, the Stalinists withdrew into

the ranks of their own party. At this time, Stalinists established a strong position
in Tonkin, where there were few Trotskyists. There, they were leaders in investi-
gative journalism and labor organization.
In Cochinchina, the Trotskyists prospered during the Popular Front era of
relatively open politics. In the Cochinchina Colonial Council elections of April
1939, the Trotskyist slate of candidates won80 percent of the vote, defeating
Constitutionalists, Stalinists, and others. Trotskyist electoral strength in the
south reflected their flexible attitude toward authority and their emphasis on
issues affecting the livelihood of large numbers of people. By the late1930s,
Vietnamese voters in Cochinchina had abandoned the Constitutionalists. Trot-
skyists were successful in elections not because voters favored communism but
rather because their firm stand against the injustices of the colonial situation was
popular.
New cultural patterns
Vietnamese history in the1930s is much more than the story of communist
activists, and not all members of the new generation were absorbed by politics.
The events just narrated above were peripheral to fundamental changes taking
place in scholarship, literature, society, and religion. The last decade without war
until the1990s, this was the most dynamic and creative era for the new gener-
ation in the full enthusiasm of youth.
Educated Vietnamese born after the turn of the twentieth century learned
about the attributes of what was perceived as“modern” civilization as displayed
by the major world powers and eagerly elaborated versions of this that became
the basis for contemporary Vietnamese culture. Inevitably, the French were in
varying degrees participants in this endeavor. Some Frenchmen and Eurasians
with French citizenship assisted Vietnamese anti-colonialists and revolutionaries
by providing legal cover for publishing and organizing activities. Others, on the
precarious“ethical edge” of colonial life and thought, dedicated themselves to
scholarship, education, medicine, and the arts with the willing collaboration of
many Vietnamese.
Established at Hanoi in 1900, the French School of the Far East (École
Française d’Extrême-Orient) was the center of French academic study of Asia.
Many prominent members of the pioneering generation of French sinology spent
periods of research and writing in Hanoi and worked on Vietnamese historical
materials using up-to-date methods. They laid the basis for what became, in the
independent Vietnam of recent decades, the academic fields of anthropology,
ethnology, archaeology, art, geography, history, linguistics, music, philology,

religion, and sociology. French people not directly associated with the School
also produced important scholarship, most famously the Catholic priest Léopold
Michel Cadière (1869–1955), who spent most of his life in Annam and published
important studies on Vietnamese history and religion.
By the1930s, young Vietnamese scholars who would have a lasting impact on
academic work in Vietnam were beginning to emerge in the French School of the
Far East. Two of the most prominent of these were Tran Van Giap (1902–1973)
and Nguyen Van Huyen (1908–1975). After a period of study at the Sorbonne in
Paris, Tran Van Giap collected and catalogued Han and Nom texts. His efforts
made possible the establishment of the Institute of Han-Nom Studies, which is
today the principal archive of character texts in Vietnam. Nguyen Van Huyen
researched and wrote on many topics but had a strong and lasting influence on
the study of anthropology, popular religion, and sociology. Another scholar
whose academic writings have stood the test of time relatively well was Hoang
Xuan Han (1900–1996). He was not affiliated with the School, but after study-
ing at the Sorbonne in the early1930s he returned to Indochina and published on
history.
A slightly different case but with a more immediate effect on thought in his
time was Tran Trong Kim (1883–1953). His career was in the French educa-
tional service, and his interests were oriented toward pedagogy. In the1920sh e
published a history of Vietnam based on traditional historical materials that was
subsequently used for decades as a classroom textbook. He also wrote a study of
Confucianism that was published in several printings during the1930s and
1940s. This book attempted to use philosophical ideas current in France to
support Confucian family ethics. It became a bible for conservatives when the
generation gap opened in the1930s and during the Vichy regime of the early
1940s.
A significant effect of French ideas about language and ethnicity was the study
of upland non-Vietnamese peoples and the categorization of them into various
ethnic groups. This procedure would later assume great importance in an inde-
pendent Vietnam when these peoples were organized as“ethnic minorities” and
policies for integrating them into the state were developed. It was at this time that
the peoples inhabiting the midlands of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An were classified
as a Muong ethnic group separate from the Vietnamese.
The Frenchman who has been best remembered in post-colonial Vietnam is
Alexandre Émile Jean Yersin (1863–1943), a Swiss-born medical doctor who
went to Asia in the early1890s with the Pasteur Institute. In1894, at the Pasteur
Institute in Hong Kong, he and his Japanese collaborator Shibasaburo Kitasato
discovered the bacillus for bubonic plague. In1895 he went to Nha Trang in
Annam and established a laboratory for manufacturing plague serum. He

became the first director of the medical school established in Hanoi in1902,
propagated the use of quinine against malaria, and experimented with rubber
trees. He spent much of his life in Nha Trang where he was highly esteemed by
the local people.
Another Frenchman who left a good reputation in Vietnam is Victor Tardieu
(1870–1937). In1925, he established the Indochina School of Fine Arts (École
des Beaux-Arts d’Indochine) in Hanoi and, until his death, dedicated himself to
training a new generation of Vietnamese artists. He disagreed with the prevailing
French opinion that traditional Vietnamese arts could not rise above artisanship
to become“fine art.” He taught European painting techniques to his students but
also encouraged them to develop their local traditions to produce what could be
recognized as modern fine art. Two of his students had a lasting influence on
Vietnamese art. Nguyen Phan Chanh (1892–1984) experimented in creating new
effects with paint on silk, and Nguyen Gia Tri (1906–1993) applied abstraction-
ism to traditional lacquer painting.
French music, opera, and theater exerted a strong influence upon the Vietnam-
ese, especially in Saigon. A new form of opera calledcai luongadapted French
theatrical and musical influences to traditional forms of opera, including a mix of
spoken and sung dialogue, and sometimes featured non-traditional instruments
such as guitar, violin, and saxophone. French popular music found a receptive
audience, especially among young Vietnamese, and Vietnamese songs began to
appear that followed French styles of lyricism and melody, which were more
rhythmic than traditional pentatonic music. The European spoken theater, with-
out music or singing, was also adopted in Saigon (calledkich noi).
Movie theaters made an appearance in Vietnamese cities during the1920s.
A small Vietnamese film industry began with silent films and was eventually
producing sound films by the late1930s. Most of the screen fare, however, came
from France and Hollywood. The films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin
were particularly popular in the1920s and1930s. Vietnamese newspapers began
to carry cartoon strips that were sometimes modeled on popular movie charac-
ters and themes.
The arena of greatest contention between the old and the new in the1930s was
literature and journalism. A great rush of passion against the Confucian tradition
of parents subordinating youth by arranged marriages blew open the gener-
ational gap and marked the beginning of what has become known as modern
Vietnamese literature. Traditional Vietnamese literature was almost exclusively
poetic. Consequently, the first significant shift in literary expression occurred in
poetry.
The two most popular poets in the early French period, both from Tonkin,
could do little more than express vexation at the contradiction between their

classical education and the colonial situation. Nguyen Khuyen (1835–1909)
received his doctoral degree in1871 and thereafter served in officialdom until
the crisis of1885 when he retired and wrote poems expressing his refusal to
accept office under the French protectorate. Tran Te Xuong (1870–1907), a
famous failure in the higher levels of the examination system in the1890s and
1900s, wrote with self-deprecating humor about the sense of uselessness he felt
after investing many years studying an outmoded curriculum and being depend-
ent upon his wife to support his family. Tan Da (1888–1939; real name: Nguyen
Khac Hieu) is often viewed as a“transitional” poet who used metaphors to
express his disgust toward French rule but also displayed a certain daring
playfulness with language that pushed beyond prevailing conventions and sug-
gested the influence of French poetry. In the1930s, poets adapted the forms and
spirit of twentieth-century French poetry to their own language. They turned
away from oblique expressions of the well-worn colonial conundrum and experi-
mented with free-verse forms to explore more personal and romantic expressions
of freedom from social conventions.
Phan Khoi (1887–1959) had participated in the reformist movement led by
Phan Chu Trinh in the1900s. He was imprisoned for three years as a result of the
1908 disturbances and subsequently pursued a career as an editor and writer. In
1932 he published a poem entitled“Old Love,” which criticized the practice of
arranged marriage. This poem inspired what came to be called the New Poetry
Movement, from which emerged the major poets of the twentieth century: The
Lu (1907–1989), Luu Trong Lu (1912–1991), Ngo Xuan Dieu (1916–1985), Cu
Huy Can (1919–2005), and Che Lan Vien (1920–1989). Although in the1940s
these men dramatically changed the content of their work to serve politics, in the
1930s they ventilated exuberant emotions of love, sadness, longing, and a full
range of personal feelings that violated traditional poetic conventions and
offended prevailing norms of expression.
In 1933, a circle of writers that included The Lu formed the Self-Strengthening
Literary Group (Tu Luc Van Doan), led by Nguyen Tuong Tam (1905–1963;
pen name: Nhat Linh). Nguyen Tuong Tam had received a high-school diploma
in1923, worked as a government clerk, briefly enrolled in the Hanoi medical
school, then shifted to Tardieu’s School of Fine Arts before going to France
where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in science. By1932, he was working on
the staff of a Saigon literary journal calledMores. The Literary Group included
Tran Khanh Giu (1896–1947; pen name: Khai Hung) and two of Nguyen Tuong
Tam’s brothers: Nguyen Tuong Long (1907–1947; pen name: Hoang Dao) and
Nguyen Tuong Vinh (1910–1942; pen name: Thach Lam). Novels published by
these men aroused controversy with their depictions of traditional Confucian
family practices as unjust, cruel, and destructive of decent human feelings.

Other writers opposed this kind of writing, viewing it as stories about people
in upper-class families who could afford the luxury of romantic confusions and
generational combat. Ngo Tat To (1894–1954) and Nguyen Cong Hoan (1903–
1977) published novels with more“realistic” depictions of human suffering and
social injustice. Perhaps the most popular writer to depict the raw side of colonial
life was Vu Trong Phung (1912–1939). He combined investigative journalism
and literature in a distinctive form of reportage that was clever, amusing, and
instructive.
The publication of newspapers, journals, magazines, books, and pamphlets
thrived in the 1930s as literacy in alphabetic Vietnamese spread. There were
publications specializing in nearly every area of interest from fiction to various
branches of science, economics, agriculture, medicine, hygiene, history, folklore,
philosophy, and religion. Developing the written vernacular to write about
totally new topics and in a form accessible to people of all classes produced
major changes in vocabulary and syntax. The idea of a grammatical sentence and
of coherent paragraphs introduced new structures of thought, logic, and argu-
mentation to readers. The spread of alphabetic literacy was the most decisive
event in the history of French Indochina. Vietnamese created their own sphere of
print culture from which the French were excluded.
French security officers learned to monitor and understand the activities of
communists, but the world of Buddhist and Cao Dai temples, secret societies,
popular cults, peripatetic healers, and belief in messianic millenarianism was
much more difficult to penetrate, particularly in Cochinchina where all of these
phenomena existed in a potent and unstable mixture.
Most French administrators preferred to see Confucianism, rather than Bud-
dhism, as the primary element in traditional Vietnamese culture because of its
emphasis on hierarchy and social order. Buddhist monks tended to be involved in
anti-colonial movements or to do little more than sit in their temples. Buddhists
existed in an anarchic constellation of competing local and regional sects, often
in conflation with popular spirit cults. The arcane and contentious world of
doctrine inhabited by the most erudite monks was totally disconnected from the
lives of lay people, of whom very few displayed any serious interest in the
religion. For the most part, people calling themselves Buddhist subscribed to
the Pure Land School that required little more than occasionally reciting a short
prayer calling on the Amitabha Buddha for“good luck.” For all of these reasons,
Buddhism was in decline in the early twentieth century as Roman Catholicism,
Confucianism, and even Cao Daism gained strength and coherence under the
colonial regime.
Beginning in the 1920s, the influence of the Chinese monk Tai Xu (1890–
1947) began to be felt in Vietnam. He had supported Sun Yatsen and the Chinese

Revolution of1911 and thereafter established an association for Buddhists that
promoted political activism. Although he represented a minority view among
Chinese monks, his ideas spread widely among young Buddhists in eastern Asia.
His advocacy of monks being involved in public affairs inspired a Cochinchinese
monk named Vien Chieu (1898–1974), who in1925 and 1926 participated in
the campaign to grant amnesty to Phan Boi Chau and in the demonstrations
provoked by Phan Chu Trinh’s death. By then, Vien Chieu was already actively
promoting a renovation of Buddhism under lay leadership and establishing his
influence in urban temples experiencing prosperity from the developing colonial
economy. In the late1920s and early1930s, Buddhist publications proliferated
and a public debate in print ensued between Vien Chieu with others of his
persuasion and the majority of monks who believed that Buddhism should not
be mixed with politics. This debate revealed a new trend in southern Vietnamese
Buddhism that would emerge as a major political movement in the1960s.
Vien Chieu argued that Buddhism was atheist and that there was no immor-
tality of the human soul. This point of view is perfectly plausible according to
prominent philosophical traditions in Buddhism. However, it was controversial
among monks because it denied fundamental assumptions that sustained popular
forms of Mahayana Buddhism, particularly Pure Land, which believed in a
Buddhist deity able to save one’s soul for the Pure Land paradise. Vien Chieu
rejected the Pure Land and the concept of an afterlife in general, which was also a
plausible, if unpopular, position for a text-based monk to take against what was
widely viewed by educated monks as a Buddhist version of popular religious
cults. What was most controversial, however, was Vien Chieu’s affirmation of
the material world as“real,” thereby rejecting the basic Buddhist doctrine that
the material world is but an illusion. He equated the idea of an illusory world
with a passive reluctance to improve the material existence of human beings and,
thus, a rejection of political involvement to improve the“real world,” to which
he was committed.
Although Vien Chieu is commonly regarded as the most prominent figure in a
Vietnamese “Buddhist revival,” in the late1930s he and many other monks left
Buddhism to join the communists. His ideas nevertheless remained influential,
particularly among younger monks. Furthermore, in rural Cochinchinese
temples, his influence mingled easily with the popular millenarianism that was
sustained by economic distress and lay waiting to be activated by a charismatic
leader.
The “action committees” in rural Cochinchina organized by Struggle Group
activists in 1936 did not cease to exist after the French banned the congress
movement, of which they were ostensibly a first step. In varying degrees they
continued to exist as unifying cooperative networks for pre-existing local

mutual-aid organizations for youth, laborers, and women. These networks were
susceptible to the influence of the Indochinese Communist Party. At this time the
Cao Dai religion was also expanding its influence. Many Cao Dai leaders
nurtured a loyalty to Cuong De, still living in Japanese exile. Consequently, after
1937, when Japan invaded China, they welcomed the prospect of Japan sweep-
ing away the French. Their anticipation of an imminent French defeat spread
through parts of rural Cochinchina where French administration had been in
decline throughout the1930s.
The decline of the colonial regime and its lapse into a defensive posture during
the 1930s came from the failure of the French to establish a relationship with
the Vietnamese that showed any plausible prospect of moving beyond the
colonial relationship of master and subordinate. During the first four decades
of the twentieth century, educated Vietnamese put a large measure of intellectual
energy into engaging the modern world and planning for the future of
their country. The French, however, were mentally inert and could not relax
from their policeman’s pose. They made no serious response to the ferment
that their rule stimulated among the Vietnamese. This unimaginative attitude
would remain fundamentally unchanged through fifteen years of war and
political upheaval.

12 INDOCHINA AT WAR
The Japanese arrive
As the Sino-Japanese War raged just over the northern border and as war in
Europe shifted from threat to reality, a fresh upsurge of religious excitement
spread in western Cochinchina. In July of1939, in a village near the Seven
Mountains near the Khmer border, a sickly but charismatic young man named
Huynh Phu So (1919–1947) claimed to be a Buddha and attracted large numbers
of followers. By the summer of1940, the resulting uproar prompted the French
to take him into custody. After nearly a year of confinement in a Cholon
psychiatric hospital, he was allowed to return to the countryside under house
arrest. In1942, the Japanese, who had meanwhile entered southern Indochina,
gained possession of him and thereafter cultivated his following as a pro-
Japanese force. This movement came to be known by the name of Huynh Phu
So’s home village, Hoa Hao. The Hoa Hao religion arose from the millenarian
traditions of western Cochinchina, but instead of being an ephemeral movement
as previous millenarian episodes had been, it gained coherence in the peculiar
conditions of the Franco-Japanese wartime relationship.
The French Popular Front faded away during the course of1938 and was
replaced by a more conservative government that began to prepare for war. In
August1939, General George Catroux (1877–1969), the commander of French
military forces in Indochina, replaced Brévié as governor general. Catroux had
served in Indochina prior to the First World War and more recently had held
colonial commands in Morocco, Algeria, and Syria. Within weeks of his appoint-
ment, the Indochina Communist Party was deprived of its legal status. Catroux
focused on military preparations and enforced strict internal security, arresting
many communists and other anti-colonial activists and confiscating their
property.
With the German conquest of France and the formation of the collaborationist
French government at Vichy in June of1940, Indochina was at a crossroads. The

French fascists of Vichy were allied through Germany with Japan, and Japan lost
no time in demanding access to Tonkin to ensure an end to supplies reaching their
Chinese enemies via the port of Hai Phong and the railway line to Yunnan. It was
quickly apparent that the continued existence of the French regime in Indochina
required either effective anti-Japanese assistance or cooperation with the Japanese
under the Vichy banner. The British in Singapore were already stretched to near
breaking point and the Americans in Manila were not yet ready to shake off their
isolationism. In July, as Japanese pressure on Indochina grew, Catroux was
replaced by Admiral Jean Decoux (1884–1963), commander of the French navy
in Asia. Decoux adhered to Vichy, thereby maximizing the possibility of preserv-
ing French rule in Indochina, albeit in alliance with Japan. Catroux departed to
join the Free French forces being formed in opposition to Vichy by Charles de
Gaulle, of whom Catroux was a close personal acquaintance.
Vichy diplomats in Tokyo reached an accord at the end of August1940 by
which Japan recognized French sovereignty in Indochina. In return, France
recognized Japanese supremacy in eastern Asia and agreed to provide Japan with
military access to Tonkin. Negotiating the details of this accord then commenced
in Indochina between Japanese military authorities and Decoux’s administration.
In late September, an arrangement was reached allowing Japanese use of several
airfields, the port of Hai Phong, the railroad lines connecting Hai Phong with
Guangxi and Yunnan, as well as the right to station up to six thousand troops
north of the Red River.
As the Franco-Japanese agreement was being finalized, impatient Japanese
army officers on the Sino-Vietnamese border and aboard troop transports off
the Tonkin coast, having grown accustomed to driving expansionary policies in
China by presenting Tokyo with faits accomplis, launched operations without
authorization. Japanese units briefly seized Lang Son, on the northern border,
and Do Son, on the coast near Hai Phong. Senior officers quickly re-established
the chain of command and restored Lang Son and Do Son to the French, but the
Lang Son episode was not a purely Franco-Japanese affair.
Several hundred Vietnamese in China had been mobilized the previous year by
Cuong De and accompanied the Japanese into Lang Son as an auxiliary force.
They were joined by hundreds of local soldiers and civilians, including commun-
ists released from the Lang Son jail. When the Japanese withdrew back into
China, this ad hoc anti-colonial accumulation of people, a mixture of Vietnamese
and ethnic minorities of the border region, unsuccessfully resisted the return of
French authority. Some of the survivors, led by local members of the Indochina
Communist Party, went into the mountains west of Lang Son and for a few
weeks contested French authority in the rugged Bac Son region where De Tham
had maintained his lair in the1890s and1900s. This became known as the Bac

Son Uprising. Eventually, a small guerrilla base under communist leadership was
established there that survived to the end of the Japanese war.
The Vichy submission to Japanese demands in Tonkin emboldened Siam,
renamed Thailand in1939, to demand that the French relinquish northern and
western Cambodian provinces and Laotian provinces west of the Mekong. The
leader of Thailand was Field Marshal Plaek Pibulsongkram (1897–1964),
commonly known as Phibun, a Thai nationalist with fascist tendencies who
dominated Thai politics from the1930s into the 1950s. Phibun was shifting
Thai foreign policy away from its deference to the British toward an accommo-
dation with Japan and saw an opportunity to reclaim territories from the
French.
Against the threat of Thai invasion, Decoux shifted his military forces into the
south. The Indochinese Communist Party had a strong organization in parts of
Cochinchina, particularly in the My Tho area. It had also infiltrated Vietnamese
army units. Hoping to benefit from the Franco-Thai confrontation, the commun-
ists planned an uprising. Learning of this, the French disarmed and confined
Vietnamese soldiers to their barracks and within a month overcame civilian
insurrectionists with overwhelming force, killing and arresting thousands of
people, including virtually the entire southern leadership of the Indochinese
Communist Party. Among those arrested was the former reformist Buddhist
monk, now communist, Vien Chieu. The debacle of this so-called Nam Ky
Uprising dealt the Stalinist party in Cochinchina a severe blow from which its
efforts to recover were slow and difficult. Meanwhile, in early1941, Japan
stepped into the Franco-Thai confrontation and forced the French to give up
the territories coveted by Phibun.
The Moscow–Tokyo “nonaggression pact” signed in April 1941 and the
German invasion of the Soviet Union in June1941 removed Tokyo’s concerns
about Russian policy in Asia and encouraged Japanese ambitions to expand into
the southern seas. As a first step, in July1941, Japan forced Vichy to accept the
integration of Indochina into the Japanese military system with the right to
station planes, ships, and tens of thousands of troops throughout Indochina.
This brought Singapore within range of Japanese bombers and provided a
strategic commissary, communication, and transshipment base for operations
against Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), and the Philippines.
The United States, unwilling to let pass this threat to all of southeastern Asia,
was aroused into action. When Japan refused American demands to withdraw
from Indochina, Japanese assets in the US were frozen and the US imposed a de
facto embargo on the export of oil and other strategic goods to Japan. Subse-
quent Japanese–American negotiations simply led to a hardening of positions on
both sides. With limited oil reserves, Japan urgently aimed to acquire the oilfields

in the Dutch East Indies and prepared to attack the American, British, and Dutch
possessions in Asia and the Pacific Ocean.
The new phase of war that broke out in December1941 brought Indochina
into the center of Japanese military activity. Decoux was soon forced to grant
Japan access to the entire communication and transportation infrastructure of
Indochina, to place the economic resources of Indochina at the disposal of Japan,
and to allow the Japanese to monitor his administration. The Japanese were
occupied with battlefields stretching from the Burmese–Indian border through
Southeast Asia to the islands of the Pacific. The convenience of retaining the
French to administer the strategic Indochinese transport and supply center
overrode Japanese propaganda about Asia for the Asians. For their part, the
French entertained the hope that the tide of war would eventually turn against
the Japanese, at which time they would still be in possession of Indochina.
During the next three years, Decoux, cut off from Europe and forced to serve
an alien imperial power, endeavored to rally the Vietnamese to his regime with a
combination of Vichy fascism and Confucian paternalism that emphasized hard
work, obedience to superiors, and concern for the welfare of subordinates.
Vietnamese civil servants, upon whom the French were now increasingly reliant,
were granted improvements in salary and promotion policies. Relatively liberal
labor laws were enforced. Particular efforts were made to win the attention of
youth by a major expansion of educational facilities and a lively program of
sports and scouting. At the same time, French security agents were busy with a
clandestine struggle to thwart Japanese cultivation of anti-French Vietnamese
nationalists.
Cao Dai leaders were not shy about expressing their loyalty to Cuong De and
his Japanese patrons. In 1941, the French deported Cao Dai leaders to the
Comoros Islands and occupied the Cao Dai headquarters in Tay Ninh. This
did not prevent remaining Cao Dai leaders from working closely with the
Japanese, providing thousands of workers for Japanese installations and organ-
izing paramilitary units with Japanese protection. In1942, Japanese agents
succeeded in plucking Huynh Phu So from French custody and thereafter used
him to spread their influence and to organize paramilitary units among his
followers in western Cochinchina.
Many educated Vietnamese drawn toward political activism were energized by
the Japanese counterweight to the French regime and the prospect of eventual
Japanese action against the French. A number of loosely connected semi-
clandestine groups with this inclination had begun to develop in Tonkin during
the Popular Front period. They aimed to draw upon a sense of connection to a
more glorious Vietnamese past than could be expressed by the names Dai Nam
(Great South) and Viet Nam (Viet South) that had come into usage during the

Nguyen dynasty, a dynasty that had failed to protect the country’s independence.
Instead, they identified with the name Dai Viet (Great Viet), which had been the
official name of the kingdom from the tenth through the eighteenth centuries.
Four such groups emerged during the late1930s. They were to some extent
influenced by the writings of Nietzsche and the muscular nationalism of the
Young Turks and of the fascism then rising in Europe and Japan. They rejected
both the ineffectual idealism of parliamentary democracy and the dialectical
materialism of the communists. An early group espoused a principle of“mutual-
ity” (ho tuong) in human relations as the basis for a theory of“between idealism
and materialism” (duy tam trung vat). Called the Dai Viet National Socialist
Party (Dai Viet Quoc Xa Dang), it was strong among urban intellectuals in
Hanoi and Hai Phong.
Another group was established by Truong Tu Anh (1914–1946), who came
from Phu Yen to Hanoi in1934 to study law and subsequently developed a
philosophy of“the people’s livelihood” (chu nghia dan toc sinh ton) that focused
upon the economic welfare of the common people; this group was named the Dai
Viet Nationalist Party (Dai Viet Quoc Dan Dang) and was strong in Bac Giang,
between Hanoi and the Guangxi border.
Two other groups emerged from people associated with the Self-Strengthening
Literary Group (Tu Luc Van Doan). One was called the Dai Viet Humanist Party
(Dai Viet Duy Dan Dang) and eventually became strong in the Ninh Binh area
south of Hanoi. The other was the Dai Viet True People (Dai Viet Dan Chinh) of
Nguyen Tuong Tam, the leading figure of the Self-Strengthening Literary Group,
which published a Hanoi newspaper and endeavored to publicize the shared
ideas of Dai Viet activists.
In 1939–1940, some Dai Viet people went to China to join the military unit
being formed by the Japanese under the auspices of Cuong De and participated in
the Lang Son affair of September1940.I n1942 and 1943, the French attempted
to suppress Dai Viet activities and made many arrests. Although he was not
directly involved with Dai Viet groups, Tran Trong Kim, the education expert,
historian, and propagandist of Confucianism, was acquainted with some of their
members, which prompted him to seek Japanese protection during a wave of
French arrests in late1943.I n1944, after the fall of Vichy France, the four Dai
Viet groups in Tonkin joined in the Dai Viet National Alliance (Dai Viet Quoc
Gia Lien Minh). Although to some extent intellectually compatible with Vichy
philosophy, Dai Viet people were uncompromisingly opposed to French
colonialism.
In Annam, Ngo Dinh Diem organized the Dai Viet Restoration Association
(Dai Viet Phuc Hung Hoi) in1942 and, with his four brothers, formed youth
groups to mobilize both Catholic and non-Catholic nationalists. His eldest

brother, Ngo Dinh Khoi, was a prominent Hue official. Ngo Dinh Khoi’s son
served on the staff of the ranking Japanese official in Hue. Ngo Dinh Khoi
opposed Pham Quynh, the prime minister, for being too pro-French and was
consequently dismissed from office. When the French moved to suppress the
Restoration Association in the summer of1944, Ngo Dinh Diem obtained
Japanese protection to evade arrest.
The Dai Viet groups gained traction from the Japanese propaganda of Asia for
the Asians. They searched the history of their own country for an Asian answer
to the impasse of Western values that were discredited by colonial capitalism on
the one hand and by the materialism of communist internationalism on the other
hand. This was a purely Vietnamese response to the country’s predicament in the
twentieth century and continued to be an influential intellectual trend for another
generation.
Formation of the Viet Minh
After the destruction of the Indochinese Communist Party in Cochinchina in
November1940, the center of party authority emerged in Tonkin under the
direction of Truong Chinh (given name: Dang Xuan Khu,1907–1988), who had
joined the Youth League in the late1920s, had spent six years in prison, and had
worked as a legal journalist in Hanoi during the Popular Front period. This man
had chosen his revolutionary name to celebrate the Long March (truong chinhin
Vietnamese) that had been a defining event in the history of the Chinese Com-
munist Party during the1930s. Within a few months he was summoned to the
Sino-Vietnamese border to join a new leadership group developing in southern
China around Ho Chi Minh.
The Comintern released Ho Chi Minh to depart Moscow in late1938 with a
caravan bringing aid and advisors to the Chinese Communist Party in north-
western China at Yenan. From there he was sent south as an officer in the Red
Army and assigned to administrative duties with joint Communist–Nationalist
operations in the Hunan –Guangxi border region. Following the Japanese
advance into Guangxi in the autumn of1939, he went to Chongqing where the
Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975) was located. There he
consulted with Zhou Enlai (1898–1976), the representative of the Chinese
Communist Party at Chiang Kai-shek’s capital, and with local Vietnamese.
One important contact that he apparently made at this time was Ho Hoc Lam
(d. 1942), a compatriot from Nghe An. Ho Hoc Lam had gone to Japan as a
student with Phan Boi Chau. There he met Chiang Kai-shek, a fellow student,
and formed a lifelong friendship with him. Ho Hoc Lam subsequently supported

Phan Boi Chau’s activities in China and eventually became a general in the
Chinese Nationalist Army. In1936, Ho Hoc Lam, along with other Vietnamese
émigrés in Nanjing, had formed an organization called the Vietnamese Independ-
ence League (Viet Nam Doc Loc Dong Minh Hoi). Although moribund, it was
still officially recognized as an organization by the Nationalist government and,
with Ho Hoc Lam’s blessing, was available for future use by Ho Chi Minh.
In early 1940, Ho Chi Minh went to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan. The
ruler of Yunnan was Long Yun (1883–1962), a sinicized member of the Yi (Lolo)
Tibeto-Burman ethnic group, who had governed the province since1927. The
relationship between Chiang Kai-shek and Long Yun was difficult, but critical
aid reached Chongqing through Yunnan via the Burma Road and the air link
over the mountains from India. Kunming was also where the largest American
air base in China was located, the home of the“Flying Tigers” of Claire Lee
Chennault (1893–1958).
In Kunming, Ho Chi Minh met with two Vietnamese members of the Indo-
chinese Communist Party just arrived from Hanoi, Pham Van Dong (1906–2000)
and Vo Nguyen Giap (b.1911). Pham Van Dong, originally from Quang Ngai,
had a typical biography of being active in Revolutionary Youth and the founding
of the Indochinese Communist Party with prison time in the1930s. Vo Nguyen
Giap, from Quang Binh, had been a secondary school classmate of Pham Van
Dong and had subsequently graduated from the University of Hanoi and became
a history teacher.
The meeting of Ho Chi Minh with these two men at Kunming in June1940
prompted letters to the Comintern and the Chinese Communist Party soliciting
aid, though there was little prospect of assistance from either potential source.
News of the events in Lang Son and Bac Son prompted Ho Chi Minh and his
accumulating associates to shift to Guilin, which was closer to military oper-
ations. Guilin was under the authority of Zhang Fakui (1896–1980), a Hakka
Nationalist general with a certain reputation for military competence. In the
wake of the unauthorized Japanese attack on Lang Son, Zhang Fakui was
driving the Japanese out of Guangxi. Meanwhile, Vietnamese refugees from the
Lang Son debacle were crossing the border into China.
In October 1940, Ho Chi Minh reactivated the Vietnamese Independence
League, obtained documentation with the name Ho Chi Minh (previously he
had used a series of cover names, the most well-known of which was Nguyen Ai
Quoc), and went to Jingxi, in western Guangxi about one hundred kilometers
from the Cao Bang border. Members of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party were
recruiting refugees from Lang Son at Jingxi. Ho Chi Minh and his entourage
went there to also take advantage of this recruiting opportunity. He made a local
accord with the Vietnamese Nationalist Party at Jingxi, forming an alliance

called the Vietnamese Liberation League (Viet Nam Gia Phong Dong Minh Hoi)
but the relationship between the two groups was competitive and without trust.
From Jingxi, Ho Chi Minh established contact with Truong Chinh’s commit-
tee in Tonkin. In May1941, he convened what became known as the Eighth
Plenum of the Indochinese Communist Party, subsequently called the Pac Bo
Plenum. Pac Bo was a liaison base in the mountains just inside the Vietnamese
border. This meeting established the Vietnamese Independence League, there-
after commonly known by the abbreviation Viet Minh, as a front organization
for the Indochinese Communist Party to rally patriotic Vietnamese willing to
fight for independence but not necessarily interested in fighting for a communist
revolution.
After a year of supervising propaganda, training recruits, and establishing
bases in Cao Bang, in August1942 Ho Chi Minh set out for Chongqing to bring
the Viet Minh to the attention of Allied representatives. Nationalist security
agents arrested him near Jingxi because of the forged documentation he was
carrying. By February1943 he had been transferred to the prison at Liuzhou, a
major center of Zhang Fakui’s operations.
In Liuzhou, Zhang Fakui had gathered Vietnamese émigrés under an umbrella
organization called the Vietnamese Revolutionary League (Viet Nam Cach Mang
Dong Minh Hoi). The Revolutionary League included members of the Vietnam-
ese Nationalist Party, the Dai Viet movement, and other smaller groups as well as
unaffiliated individuals. Nguyen Hai Than (1879–1955) was chairman of the
Revolutionary League. He was a veteran of Phan Boi Chau’s operations and a
long-term resident of China. He had been peripherally affiliated with Ho Chi
Minh’s Revolutionary Youth movement of the1920s, but did not like its com-
munist connection. He had also been associated with Ho Hoc Lam in the
formation of the Vietnamese Independence League at Nanjing in1936.
A prominent figure in the Revolutionary League was Nguyen Tuong Tam, the
former leader of the1930s literary group turned Dai Viet activist. He had gone to
China where he became a leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. Another
leading figure in the Revolutionary League was Vu Hong Khanh (1898–1993).
He had fled to China during the failed uprising of the Nationalist Party in1930.
He became a general in the Chinese Nationalist army, established a good
relationship with Long Yun in Yunnan, and had assembled a Nationalist Party
base at Kunming.
Zhang Fakui’s intention was to use the Revolutionary League to develop an
intelligence operation in Indochina. Eventually, he learned of Ho Chi Minh’s true
identity and was authorized by Chongqing to make use of him. After being
released from prison and demonstrating his ability to supply information, Ho
Chi Minh was brought into a reorganized Revolutionary League in early1944.

Finally, in August1944, Zhang Fakui allowed Ho Chi Minh to leave Liuzhou,
and he returned to Cao Bang.
During Ho Chi Minh’s two years of confinement in Guangxi, his colleagues
began to build military bases in the mountains north of Hanoi and initiated
National Salvation Associations (Hoi Cuu Quoc) to expand their influence
among peasants, workers, youth, women’s organizations, and soldiers in Tonkin
and Annam. Truong Chinh was particularly active in rallying intellectuals into
the Viet Minh. In addition to a National Salvation Cultural Association (Hoi
Van Hoa Cuu Quoc), he also formed two ostensibly non-communist parties as
member organizations of the Viet Minh front: the Vietnamese Socialist Party
(Viet Nam Xa Hoi Dang) and the Vietnamese Democratic Party (Viet Nam Dan
Chu Dang).
The August Revolution
For Vietnamese in Tonkin and northern Annam, the winter of1944–1945 was a
time of famine with around one million people dying of starvation. The1944
spring rice crop had been reduced by drought and insect infestation and the
autumn crop had been reduced by a typhoon; however, by themselves these
events would not have caused this famine. Another factor was a long-term trend
of population growth and decline of rice production in northern Vietnamese
provinces that made them dependent upon rice from Cochinchina. This was
exacerbated during the war by the Japanese demand that land be shifted from
rice to strategic commodities such as jute, hemp, ramie, cotton, peanuts, and
castor oil seed; this mainly affected Tonkin where these items were best cultivated
due to soil and climate. But even under these conditions a famine would not have
occurred without more immediate factors related to the final year of the war.
After the Allied liberation of France and the fall of the Vichy French govern-
ment in the summer of 1944, the French military command in Indochina
expanded its clandestine contact with Free French forces and made plans for
the anticipated defeat of Japan. The arrival of American forces in the Philippines
raised the possibility that the Americans might land in Indochina, although it was
becoming obvious to all that the main line of American attack was directly
toward the Japanese islands. In the autumn of1944, American bombers began
to hit Vietnamese ports and railroads and the US navy began to sink coastal
shipping. Consequently, the amount of rice that could be shipped from Cochin-
china to the north in1944 was much less than usual.
But even the American disruption of the transportation system would not have
produced such a devastating famine if not for the policies of the two armies in

Indochina. The final phase of the war turned nervous allies into potential
enemies. Most of the transportation system was reserved for military purposes
and both the French and the Japanese stockpiled large amounts of rice that
would normally have been available for the civilian market. Furthermore,
because of the looming military and political uncertainties, the wartime economy
was collapsing with large-scale inflation, speculation, and hoarding.
In the midst of the famine, the tensions between the French and Japanese were
released in early March 1945 when the Japanese disarmed and interned the
French. Although this is what the French had most feared, they had done little
to prepare for it and it was a relatively quick and non-violent event. In just a few
hours, the French colonial regime was brought to an end by a dying imperial
power whose own life was draining away. General Tsuchihashi Yuitsu (1891–
1975) planned and executed this action. He had served as a military attaché at
the Japanese embassy in Paris in the late1930s and had held various Southeast
Asian commands during the war before being assigned to Indochina in1944.H e
became the de facto governor general of Indochina and assigned senior Japanese
diplomats to replace the ranking French administrators in Cochinchina, Annam,
and Tonkin. At the same time, he proclaimed Vietnam to be independent and
formed a royal government at Hue to which he could pass governing responsi-
bilities as the war ended.
Some Vietnamese, especially among the Cao Dai, expected Tsuchihashi to
replace Bao Dai with Cuong De, who was residing in Tokyo, but wartime
conditions made travel for such an important person too risky, and, in any case,
Tsuchihashi wanted to minimize disruption as the Japanese position was becom-
ing more fragile. Pham Quynh was discarded as Bao Dai’s prime minister, both
because of his Francophile disposition and because Bao Dai did not like him.
Ngo Dinh Diem was widely regarded as the strongest candidate to replace Pham
Quynh, but his strong anti-French attitude had inhibited his relationship with
Bao Dai, and Tsuchihashi turned to Tran Trong Kim. After seeking protection
with the Japanese in1943, Tran Trong Kim had spent a year in Singapore and
then was transferred to Bangkok. He was now brought to Hue and installed as
head of a quasi-independent royal government.
It took until early May for Tran Trong Kim to form his cabinet of ministers
and to begin to provide leadership to the protectorate government in Tonkin and
Annam. His government did not extend its authority over Cochinchina or major
cities, although the Japanese finally approved of it doing so at the very end of the
war. With its passive reliance on the Japanese, it was a factor in the evolving
situation more by what it did not do than by anything it did do. It did not inhibit
the activities of nationalist organizations, which began to operate with a freedom
that had never existed before.

Although it did not exercise the substance of independence, Tran Trong Kim’s
government nevertheless accelerated the mood of independence by releasing
political prisoners and replacing the institutional symbols and vocabulary of
the colonial regime with Vietnamese versions, giving the country the name of
Viet Nam, replacing the terms Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina with Bac Bo,
Trung Bo, and Nam Bo (northern division, central division, and southern div-
ision), issuing a national flag and a national anthem, organizing national holi-
days to celebrate famous events and heroic people in Vietnamese history. Most of
all, the charismatic Minister of Youth, Phan Anh (1912–1990), contributed to
politicizing young people and preparing them to participate in revolutionary
action. Originally from Ha Tinh, Phan Anh studied law in France and spent
the war years in Hue writing for a youth publication. During his brief time as
Minister of Youth, he traveled extensively, speaking to gatherings of youth
and exciting them with patriotic fervor. On the other hand, in the final weeks
before the Japanese surrender, Tran Trong Kim was immobilized by a cabinet
crisis. For the most part, the protectorate administration facilitated rather than
obstructed the draining away of its authority at war’s end.
Meanwhile, the Indochinese Communist Party was quick to take advantage of
the Japanese takeover in early March. By this time, the Americans had begun to
bomb railroads and harbors in Indochina to impede Japanese transport and
communications; some American planes were shot down, and Ho Chi Minh
established contact with US officers in Kunming by way of returning surviving
pilots who had come under the control of his people. It was a propitious time
because the French internment had erased the Allied intelligence network in
Indochina, and Ho Chi Minh was in a position to offer an alternative. American
intelligence officers sent him back with a radioman and within weeks were
parachuting supplies, equipment, and weapons trainers.
In the summer of1945, Ho Chi Minh and his associates established a head-
quarters at Tan Trao, in Son Duong district of Tuyen Quang Province, less than
two hundred kilometers northwest of Hanoi. Around seventy people from
northern Indochina were summoned as delegates to a series of conferences held
at Tan Trao in mid August, then urgently sent back to their localities as news of
the unexpectedly sudden Japanese surrender spread through the Vietnamese
population.
During the five months between the internment of the French and the Japanese
surrender, the Indochinese Communist Party was not the only political organiza-
tion to anticipate an opportunity. In late March1945, the Dai Viet National
Alliance that had been formed in1944 reorganized for military action. Despite
the Dai Viet affinity for the Japanese, the Japanese were preoccupied with their
sinking fortunes and gave the Dai Viet little encouragement. Dai Viet activists

nevertheless became discernible factors in certain localities of lowland Tonkin.
Nguyen Tuong Tam briefly attempted to mobilize these Dai Viet elements until
he decided that Japan was a dead end and, in the summer of1945, returned to
Guangxi where he again became active in the Nationalist Party. From its base in
Yunnan, the Nationalist Party established a strong presence down the Red River
toward Hanoi. Groups associated with the Revolutionary League in Guangxi
became active in Quang Ninh Province along the coast and its hinterland adja-
cent to the Chinese border.
What distinguished the Indochinese Communist Party and the organizations it
had gathered in the Viet Minh front from its rivals were the breadth and depth of
its influence both regionally and socially, although in most cases this influence
was diffuse and more of a potential capable of being awakened by circumstances
than a structure for conveying instructions and directing responses. At the time of
the Japanese surrender, the Indochinese Communist Party was but one element
in a revolutionary situation far beyond its capacity to control. It gained power in
Hanoi and elsewhere through the accumulation of initiatives by many groups,
few of which were under its direct supervision but most of which were suscep-
tible to its leadership.
Upon news of Tokyo’s surrender, Japanese forces quickly withdrew from
exposed outposts, concentrated near ports from where they expected to be
repatriated, and assumed an attitude of armed passivity, minimizing contact with
local administrators. The royal government at Hue was inert. The communist
leaders prepared to move out of their mountain bases toward Hanoi. Meanwhile,
in villages, towns, and cities across the country, activists banded together to
absorb or overwhelm existing authorities in a burst of exhilaration at the absence
of foreign rulers.
Already in the weeks before the Japanese surrender there were violent episodes
between Viet Minh activists and rival groups such as the Nationalist Party and
the Dai Viet, particularly in provinces with easy access to the Chinese border
where the leaders of these groups were located. The Japanese surrender did not
create a vacuum. It simply removed the external restraints on a Vietnamese
political process that had been developing for a long time in underground
organizations and in the minds of people. Four days after the Japanese surrender,
Viet Minh activists, mainly members of the Democratic Party, seized control of
Hanoi and delivered it into the hands of their leaders, who arrived from the
mountains a few days later.
Vietnamese historians call this the August Revolution. An initial phase of
chaotic, exuberant, often spontaneous and relatively non-violent seizing of
power by local groups was soon followed by a second phase in which the
communist leadership in Hanoi extended its authority throughout Tonkin and

down the coast of Annam. In some areas rival groups retained control, such as
the Nationalist Party upriver from Hanoi where they benefited from easy access
to their base in Kunming and the protection of incoming Chinese troops from
Yunnan. In other areas, particularly the further south one went, where the Viet
Minh organization was progressively weaker, uprisings turned violent, as in
Quang Ngai, or resulted in confrontation between rival groups claiming to be
Viet Minh, as in Binh Dinh and Phu Yen. Agents of the new authorities in Hanoi
were sent to sort out local issues and to eliminate people regarded as threats to
the regime. Thousands were assassinated, including prominent Francophiles such
as Bui Quang Chieu and Pham Quynh.
The revolution had come to Quang Ngai early and violently with the arrival of
local communists released from prison in the central highlands after the French
internment. By the time of the Japanese surrender, radical groups claiming
affiliation with the Viet Minh were already in the process of spreading class
struggle in rural areas. The provincial governor happened to be Ngo Dinh Diem’s
eldest brother Ngo Dinh Khoi, who had been appointed by Tran Trong Kim. In
the high tide of the August Revolution, he was put to death, and his son with
him. Quang Ngai was also the final resting place of Ta Thu Thau, who was
seized and killed as he was making his way from Tonkin to Saigon.
Return of the French
Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnamese independence and the Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam at a Hanoi rally on September2, but already the attention of his
new government was shifting from internal matters to the arrival of Allied
troops, ostensibly to disarm and repatriate the Japanese. At the Potsdam confer-
ence in July, Allied leaders divided Indochina at the sixteenth parallel with British
forces responsible for the south and Chinese Nationalist forces responsible for
the north. The sixteenth parallel crosses the Vietnamese coast between Da Nang
and Hoi An in Quang Nam Province.
Chiang Kai-shek took this allied assignment as an opportunity to settle matters
with Long Yun, the leader of Yunnan whom he distrusted. He placed Long Yun
in command of the Indochinese operation as a way of emptying Yunnan of Long
Yun’s troops. Lu Han (1895–1974), a cousin of Long Yun and a general in his
army, was given charge of the Indochina operation, during which Chiang Kai-
shek engineered the replacement of Long Yun by Lu Han, an affair that dis-
tracted Lu Han from events in Indochina. Accompanying the Chinese forces into
northern Indochina were hundreds of Vietnamese anti-communist nationalists
returning from exile, the most prominent of whom were Nguyen Tuong Tam and

Vu Hong Khanh of the Nationalist Party and Nguyen Hai Than with an
assortment of people gathered in the Revolutionary League.
The Chinese understood that they could not push aside the new authorities in
Hanoi without provoking a popular reaction that would endanger their mission.
At the same time, they pressured Ho Chi Minh to incorporate into his govern-
ment the anti-communist politicians who arrived in Hanoi with them. Within a
few weeks of the September2 declaration of independence, it became obvious
to Ho Chi Minh that he and his communist colleagues would have to broaden
their government to include large numbers of people not associated with the Viet
Minh front. This was not only because of Chinese pressure to include members
of the Nationalist Party and the Revolutionary League, but also because they
could not entirely control the overwhelming popular response to the August
Revolution. Practical problems of establishing a new system of government
required the inclusion of many people outside of their organizational control.
The Dai Viet groups, however, were outlawed from the start, ostensibly because
of their association with the Japanese.
In November, the Indochinese Communist Party officially disbanded and went
underground. Subsequent negotiations produced an arrangement by which sev-
enty of the National Assembly seats to be filled in a January1946 election were
reserved for members of the Nationalist Party (allotted fifty seats) and the
Revolutionary League (allotted twenty seats). These allotted seats amounted to
about20 percent of the Assembly. Furthermore, a cabinet was to be formed that
included members from both of these non-Viet Minh groups. Ho Chi Minh was
to be president of the new coalition government and Nguyen Hai Than was
designated as vice president. This government came into existence in early1946
just as the French, having returned to the south, were preparing to re-enter the
north.
In August 1945 the Viet Minh organization in Cochinchina was mostly on
paper and the Communist Party in Cochinchina was split and surrounded by
rivals. The regional leadership committee could not agree on what to do, being
divided into factions based in Can Tho and in Saigon, each of which sent
representatives to Hanoi seeking approval. The leader of the Saigon faction
was Tran Van Giau (1911–2010), a southerner who had followed a typical
communist career with sojourns in Paris, in Moscow, and in Indochinese prisons.
In addition to arguing with his fellow communists, Tran Van Giau had to
negotiate with a constellation of religious, monarchist, and other groups that
had been encouraged by the Japanese in the last months of the war.
After disarming the French in March, the Japanese had begun to arm para-
military units attached to the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao religions. When Japan
surrendered, these groups along with Catholics, Dai Viet activists, Trotskyists,

and members of the Red Cross, militia, police, and other groups formed a United
National Front. On August21, two days after the Viet Minh takeover in
Hanoi, these groups led a large demonstration in the streets of Saigon. Ngo
Dinh Diem was one of the leaders of this front.
Two days later, Bao Dai abdicated and announced his support of the Viet
Minh government in Hanoi, thereby defeating the hopes of monarchists. More to
the point, Tran Van Giau persuaded some leaders of the United National Front
that they would be handicapped when seeking international recognition because
the Allies would view their organization as tainted by association with Japan.
Consequently, many groups chose to join the public demonstration organized
by the Viet Minh on August25 at which Tran Van Giau announced a Southern
Provisional Administrative Committee. However, when it became clear that
communists dominated this committee the various groups began to go their
separate ways.
In the spring of1945, the Vichy sport and youth movement in Cochinchina
had been reformed as a paramilitary organization under Japanese auspices. It
was called Vanguard Youth and was led by Pham Ngoc Thao (1909–1968), a
medical doctor trained in France who had become involved in politics during the
Popular Front period. By September1945, Pham Ngoc Thao was a secret
member of the Indochinese Communist Party, and Vanguard Youth accordingly
became the most important element in the southern Viet Minh. In the last days of
August it was the Vanguard Youth that brought the revolution to the Cochin-
chinese countryside.
In western Cochinchina, however, the Hoa Hao resisted Viet Minh ascend-
ancy, leading to episodes of violence, and Huynh Phu So publicly denounced
Tran Van Giau. At Tay Ninh, the Cao Dai leadership split between those willing
to cooperate with the Viet Minh and those who were not. Tran Van Giau
eliminated many Trotskyists and other miscellaneous enemies of the party, but
he could not form a government with broad popular support as the Viet Minh
had done in Hanoi and in other cities further north. A Saigon rally that he
organized on September2 to coincide with the proclamation of independence
in Hanoi turned into a bloody riot between Vietnamese and French residents of
the city. He subsequently lost control of the Provisional Committee. His superi-
ors in Hanoi later dismissed him from political work, considering his leadership
in Saigon to have been heavy-handed and inept, but the situation in Cochinchina
was beyond the grasp of any one man or party.
The 20th Indian Division, veterans of the Burma campaign, began to arrive in
the second week of September. It was commanded by Douglas David Gracey
(1894–1964), a career officer in the Indian army with a reputation for compe-
tence. The British recognized French sovereignty in Indochina. They were spread

thin in Asia at that time, and Gracey limited his role to enforcing public order
and facilitating the arrival of French forces. Under instructions to avoid getting
involved in local politics and with inadequate numbers of troops, he occupied
Saigon with caution.
The tension between the French and Vietnamese populations in the city was
explosive. In late September, Gracey prematurely rearmed a French unit that had
been interned by the Japanese. The French soldiers took possession of public
buildings and expelled the Provisional Committee from the city. They went on to
provoke a riot by assaulting Vietnamese civilians and taking many of them
prisoner. Gracey sent the French back to their barracks, but within hours the
Vietnamese underworld erupted against French civilians, killing around two
hundred of them. To restore order, Gracey resorted to activating rearmed Jap-
anese prisoners under his command. These events strengthened the determin-
ation of British authorities to turn the Indochina business over to the French as
quickly as possible.
French post-war colonial policy vaguely envisioned a French Union in which a
five-state Indochinese Federation existed under a French governor general. The
states, corresponding to the five parts of French Indochina, would enjoy varying
degrees of local autonomy while economic, military, and diplomatic powers
remained with the French. Such was the plan announced by the government of
Charles de Gaulle in early1945. This plan may have been plausible if the end of
the war had found the French still in power in Indochina, but the events of1945
rendered this an antiquated dream. French aims required that the Vietnamese
acquiesce to the return of French colonial rule. Although this was a vain hope,
French policy remained stuck on this point, which meant that the first necessary
step for the French was to reconquer the Vietnamese.
The men chosen by de Gaulle to do this were closely associated with him
during the European war, men he trusted and who were devoted to him. General
Philippe François Marie Leclerc de Hauteclocque (1902–1947) had a venerable
aristocratic lineage. He commanded the first French units to reach Paris in1944
and, as commander of French forces in Asia, represented France at the September 2
surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay. He arrived in Saigon in early October with
the first large infusion of French troops from Europe. Georges Louis Marie
Thierry d’Argenlieu (1889–1964), with a mixed naval and monastic career, had
risen to the rank of admiral in de Gaulle’s navy. Appointed as high commissioner
with supreme authority for implementing French policy in Indochina, he arrived
in Saigon at the end of October. Leclerc and d’Argenlieu single-mindedly pursued
a policy of reconquest.
By the end of the year, Leclerc had retaken most cities and towns in Cochin-
china and southern Annam and the British were departing. By early1946 Leclerc

was making plans to attack Tonkin, but this would not be possible without some
understanding with the Chinese. On February28, 1946, French diplomats in
Chongqing signed an agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by which France
renounced the unequal treaties of the past and China recognized French sover-
eignty in Indochina. The next day, Leclerc departed Saigon with a large exped-
itionary force aboard a fleet of over thirty ships. Wanting to complete his Tonkin
campaign before the monsoon rains began in May, he planned to arrive at Hai
Phong on March6 when a high tide would allow his heavy ships upriver to
the docks. The next high tide would not occur until March18, which in his
calculations would be too late in the season.
The Chinese were unwilling to be caught in the middle of a war between the
French and the Vietnamese and made it clear that they would not allow the
French to land without Vietnamese approval. When French ships appeared at
Hai Phong on the morning of March6, Chinese forces fired on them and were
prepared to contest their landing until word arrived that a Franco-Vietnamese
agreement was being signed in Hanoi. This agreement postponed war in the
north until after the Chinese departed six months later.
Finalized under the pressure of the high tide, the Franco-Vietnamese Agree-
ment of March 6 contained provisions repugnant to both sides. Instead of
obtaining French recognition of Vietnamese “independence,” Ho Chi Minh
agreed to his government being weakly identified as a“free state” (état libre)
within the Indochinese Federation under the French Union. For their part, the
French agreed to two provisions they had no intention of honoring. French
troops north of the sixteenth parallel were limited to fifteen thousand men for
a period of five years, and a referendum was to be held on the issue of unifying
the Vietnamese regions. This agreement entangled the French and Vietnamese in
joint military operations and fruitless negotiations for several months.
Outbreak of a new war
The central issue in subsequent Franco-Vietnamese negotiations was the status of
Cochinchina. D’Argenlieu was determined to deny Ho Chi Minh’s government
any claim to the south. At a conference held during April and May in Dalat, a
colonial resort in the Central Highlands, d’Argenlieu made it clear to the Viet-
namese representatives from Hanoi that there would be no referendum. He was
busy setting up a Republic of Cochinchina with Nguyen Van Thinh (1888–
1946), a former Constitutionalist politician and a French citizen, as president.
Many Vietnamese who had adapted to French colonialism and nurtured political
ambitions gathered around Nguyen Van Thinh. In August, d’Argenlieu convened

another conference at Dalat with pliant representatives from all five regions of
Indochina. This conference denounced the Hanoi government and made plans
for an Indochinese Federation. From d’Argenlieu’s perspective, Ho Chi Minh’s
government was a temporary annoyance.
The scheme for a Republic of Cochinchina united virtually all of the southern
groups, including the Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao, in opposition. The fighting
between French and Vietnamese in Cochinchina that had begun the previous
autumn intensified. Tran Van Giau was called back to the north and replaced by
Nguyen Binh (1906–1951), a former Nationalist Party activist from near Hanoi
who had meanwhile joined the communists. Nguyen Binh turned the Viet Minh
into a military alliance against the threat of Cochinchinese separatism. He made
extensive use of terror, including the detonation of bombs in public places, to
discredit French authority. The fighting in Cochinchina continued through the
summer and into the autumn of1946.
Meanwhile, Ho Chi Minh and Pham Van Dong had traveled to France to
negotiate directly with the government in Paris. This was a time of transition
between the immediate post-war government of Charles de Gaulle, who had
abruptly resigned in January1946, and the constitution of the Fourth Republic,
which would go into effect in January1947. The dominant politician during this
year was Georges Augustin Bidault (1899–1983), a former history teacher, pre-
war Catholic anti-fascist youth leader, veteran of the wartime resistance, and
Minister of Foreign Affairs since August1944. He had supported de Gaulle but
believed that de Gaulle’s preference for a presidential, rather than a parliamen-
tary, constitution was not plausible in the existing political situation. Bidault led
one of the three main political parties at that time, the Mouvement Républicain
Populaire (commonly referred to as the MRP), the other two being the Socialist
Party and the Communist Party. The election of June1946 resulted in Bidault
forming a government that included socialists and communists. He served as
both Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs in this government.
Ho Chi Minh was personally acquainted with some of the socialist and
communist politicians because he had been a member of both parties during
his residence in Paris a quarter-century before. Although he was welcomed
warmly, there was no political will in France, even among socialists and com-
munists, to support his negotiating agenda. In the uncertain political situation of
1946, no French politician was prepared to gainsay the Indochina policy estab-
lished by de Gaulle and continued by Bidault, the main points of which were
maintenance of the Tonkin–Annam–Cochinchina division and no recognition of
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as an“independent” state. Furthermore,
with d’Argenlieu and Leclerc in Indochina actively implementing this policy, a
more robust government than Bidault’s ephemeral five-month coalition turned

out to be would have been required to implement a change of course. Neverthe-
less, d’Argenlieu was able to pursue this policy because French politicians over-
whelming agreed with it, regardless of any supposed weakness of the Paris
government.
In mid September, after two months of failed negotiations at the Paris suburb
of Fontainebleau, the Vietnamese negotiator, Pham Van Dong, departed. At that
moment, the last of the Chinese were leaving Tonkin. The Chinese had pro-
longed their departure to enable thousands of troops from Yunnan and Guangxi
to be shipped by rail to Hai Phong for embarkation to the civil war battlefields in
northern China. Now, without their presence, the possibility of war breaking out
between the Vietnamese and the French increased day by day. Even as the
Chinese presence had produced the Franco-Vietnamese agreement of the previ-
ous March, the Chinese absence led to another Franco-Vietnamese agreement
designed to prolong the prospect of settling matters peacefully.
One day after Pham Van Dong’s departure and three days before the last
Chinese troops were scheduled to depart Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh, who had
been vainly trying to rally political support for his government among Paris
politicians, signed a modus vivendi with the Minister for Overseas France,
Marius Moutet (1876–1968). Moutet, a socialist, agreed in principle with the
established Indochina policy, but, perhaps under the pressure of time, he was not
alert to the practical effects of the modus vivendi. This agreement guaranteed the
safety of French citizens and their property and established committees and
commissions to address outstanding questions. The most important item in this
modus vivendi, however, was the provision for a ceasefire in Cochinchina
effective October30. This ceasefire provision had far-reaching implications
and results, for it diminished d ’Argenlieu’s scheme for a Republic of
Cochinchina.
With this modus vivendi, the French government recognized the Vietnamese
resistance in Cochinchina as a legitimate party to a ceasefire and not simply as
terrorists beyond the law. The French government also acknowledged that Ho
Chi Minh was competent to deal on behalf of the Cochinchina resistance. The
modus vivendi undermined both d’Argenlieu’s Republic of Cochinchina and the
French doctrine of regional separation. Furthermore, when in fact Nguyen Binh
and his Cochinchinese allies honored the ceasefire on October30, it was
obvious that Ho Chi Minh spoke for them. Nguyen Van Thinh, president of
the Republic of Cochinchina, committed suicide ten days after the ceasefire went
into effect.
Just as his Cochinchina policy suffered this setback, the November 10
election in France posed a further challenge to d’Argenlieu. Gains by the social-
ists and communists brought the Bidault cabinet to an end. The new constitution

of the Fourth Republic had been approved and would go into effect at the
beginning of1947. Meanwhile, socialists, some of whom had expressed criticism
of d’Argenlieu, formed caretaker governments. D’Argenlieu departed for France
three days after the election to ensure that political change in Paris did not
disturb his Indochina policy. He left local matters in the hands of trusted subor-
dinates, most important of whom was General Jean Etienne Valluy (1899–1970),
who had replaced Leclerc the previous summer.
Since October, Valluy and d’Argenlieu had been making plans to initiate
hostilities in the north in order to remove the Vietnamese government in Hanoi,
thereby disposing of the main obstacle to the Indochinese Federation and invali-
dating the Cochinchinese implications of the modus vivendi ceasefire. Before
departing for France, d’Argenlieu instructed Valluy to implement these plans.
This was done without delay.
The situation in the north had greatly changed during the preceding months
while Ho Chi Minh was in France. Most Chinese occupying forces had departed
by June and with them went many of the anti-communist Vietnamese politicians
who had sheltered under their protection, including Nguyen Hai Than, Nguyen
Tuong Tam, and Vu Hong Khanh. The government consequently became more
homogeneous and compliant with the communist leadership. Some groups,
particularly members of the Nationalist Party, resisted the turn of events, but
Vo Nguyen Giap attacked them, killing or arresting many hundreds. The French
cooperated with this campaign because the Nationalist Party was more implac-
ably anti-French than the Viet Minh. At the same time, a new front was assem-
bled to bring several groups that had previously had a separate organizational
existence into alliance with the Viet Minh, in particular unions and associations
representing women, workers, and youth. This was known as the Lien Viet
(Hoi Lien Hiep Quoc Dan Viet Nam, Vietnamese People’s National United
Association).
Meanwhile, Viet Minh agents were purchasing arms in various Asian coun-
tries, mainly China and Thailand, and stockpiling supplies in the mountains.
Franco-Vietnamese tensions escalated in the seaport of Hai Phong, the main
point of access for the Vietnamese to the outside world and for the French to
Tonkin. Vietnamese and French military units coexisted in a volatile state of
restrained antagonism with control of the docks being the focus of contention.
After d’Argenlieu’s departure for France in mid November, Valluy instructed his
subordinates in Tonkin to escalate provocations. Open warfare eventually broke
out on November23 when the French seized Hai Phong after heavy fighting
and a bombardment that killed thousands of civilians. At the same time, French
forces seized Lang Son, where the railroad connected with Guangxi. The Viet-
namese began to evacuate Hanoi, and, less than a month later, on December19,

fighting broke out there as the Vietnamese government and army shifted to
the mountains.
In accepting this war, the French anticipated a short campaign that would be
over long before 1950 when their calculations indicated that they would no
longer be able to financially sustain a war in Indochina. Even French leaders
who believed that French interests in Indochina could have been arranged
without resorting to war were confident of a quick military solution. Leclerc,
d’Argenlieu, and Valluy had implemented a policy that was widely supported by
the French political establishment and the French people. That the war would
last so long and that it would eventually become part of a global confrontation
beyond the national interests of France were unforeseen.
A Franco-Vietnamese government
Although large numbers of Vietnamese rallied to the Viet Minh to defend
national independence, there were also many Vietnamese who saw the under-
lying Viet Minh agenda of communist revolution as a threat to their vision of an
independent Vietnam. They viewed a renewal of French colonialism as an
unlikely long-term prospect in a decolonizing world, and they looked for ways
to keep alive the possibility of an independent but non-communist Vietnam.
These people needed some kind of plausible leader with a potentially broad
national appeal, and some of them began to look in the direction of Bao Dai.
Bao Dai had earned a measure of good will among the Vietnamese by his
abdication and willingness to be a“patriotic citizen” during the August Revolu-
tion. After a few months in Hanoi as“advisor” to the new government, he went
to China and remained there, drawing the attention of both non-communist
Vietnamese politicians and French administrators.
The new French constitution contained the legal basis for designing an
Indochinese Federation within the French Union, which up until then had been
simply a vague idea. In January1947, the first government of the Fourth
Republic was formed under the leadership of Paul Ramadier (1888–1961), a
socialist. He envisioned an Indochinese Federation made up not of five or four
parts as earlier concepts espoused by d’Argenlieu proposed, but rather three
“associated states” for the Cambodians, the Laotians, and the Vietnamese. This
willingness to speak of a united Vietnam, despite legal impediments entrenched
in the special status of Cochinchina dating from the mid nineteenth century,
became the basis for French discussions with Bao Dai. Another factor softening
the French position was the Madagascar uprising, which prevented military
reinforcements from reaching Indochina before the rains began. In early1947,

the French signed an accord with Cao Dai leaders and, after the communist
murder of Huynh Phu So in April, also made an agreement with Hoa Hao
leaders. Thereafter, the French subsidized and relied upon Cao Dai and Hoa
Hao armies to fight the Viet Minh in rural Cochinchina. With the monsoon rains
inhibiting military operations until autumn, the French seemed to be in a mood
to talk, if not to negotiate.
In March 1947, Ramadier replaced d’Argenlieu with Émile Bollaert (1890–
1978), a man with no experience outside of France. From a family of musicians,
Bollaert earned a law degree; served with distinction in the army during the First
World War; occupied a series of mid-level government posts, mostly provincial,
in the inter-war period; served in the wartime resistance until captured; and
ended the war in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In the weeks before he
was replaced, d’Argenlieu was beginning to promote the idea of using Bao Dai to
rally Vietnamese behind French policy. Although not given the freedom of action
that had been exercised by d’Argenlieu, Bollaert endeavored to open paths of
consultation with Vietnamese who were willing to work with France in a process
they were led to believe was aimed at dissolving the colonial relationship. Shortly
after arriving in Indochina, Bollaert established contact with both Bao Dai and
Ho Chi Minh.
At the time of Bollaert’s initial contact with Ho Chi Minh in April1947,H o
Chi Minh entertained the possibility that the French communists, who were then
a significant part of Ramadier’s government, could influence French policy in his
favor. In the summer of1947, he brought more non-communists into his gov-
ernment and attempted to project a demeanor of moderation, expressing a
willingness to be in the French Union if Vietnam were independent and unified.
The French were unwilling to go so far and, believing that military operations
during the upcoming dry season would eliminate the Viet Minh, preferred to deal
with Bao Dai, who was more malleable to their purposes.
In early1947, leading figures in the Nationalist Party and the Revolutionary
League who had taken refuge in China during1946 gathered around Bao Dai.
Subsequently, other prominent figures from inside Indochina also went to con-
sult with Bao Dai, including Le Van Hoach (1896–1978), a member of the Cao
Dai who had replaced Nguyen Van Thinh as president of the Republic of
Cochinchina; the chief military leader of the Cao Dai; the ranking Vietnamese
administrators of Tonkin and Annam; and Ngo Dinh Diem.
In September1947, Bao Dai, in Hong Kong, issued a statement indicating his
willingness to talk with the French on behalf of an independent and united
Vietnam. Long-distance discussions between Bao Dai and Bollaert accelerated.
In October, France signaled its abandonment of d’Argenlieu’s Cochinchina
separatism policy by changing the Republic of Cochinchina to the Provisional

Government of South Vietnam. At the same time, the French replaced Le Van
Hoach, whom they did not trust, with Nguyen Van Xuan (1892–1989), a
French citizen and a general in the French army who had collaborated with
Nguyen Van Thinh and d’Argenlieu in forming the Republic of Cochinchina a
year and a half before. Nguyen Van Xuan also supported an accommodation
with Bao Dai.
Meanwhile, with the coming of the dry season, General Valluy made his move
into the mountains to exterminate Ho Chi Minh’s government. The operation
was a dismal failure, and by the end of the year his men were forced to withdraw
back to the lowlands. Thereafter, the war appeared to settle into a stalemate that
worried the French because they understood that they could not sustain an
interminable war. Furthermore, French policymakers were increasingly con-
vinced that even battlefield success would lead nowhere without developing an
alternative to the Viet Minh that was acceptable to a critical mass of influential
Vietnamese. Despite the dramatic post-war growth of the French colon commu-
nity, French authorities were dependent upon the service and cooperation of
large numbers of Vietnamese civil servants, including police and soldiers. The
politicians who represented these Vietnamese were using Bao Dai to press for
change in the Franco-Vietnamese relationship.
In November1947, Ramadier’s government fell and was replaced by the more
conservative government of Robert Schuman (1886–1963). Ramadier had been
diffident about making an agreement with Bao Dai. That constraint was now
removed. In early December, Bao Dai and Bollaert met and signed a statement
that became the basis for further negotiations. In June1948, Bollaert signed an
agreement with Bao Dai that envisioned“independence” and “unity” for Viet-
nam. To facilitate this, a month earlier Nguyen Van Xuan’s government in
Saigon was renamed the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam. Now,
for the first time, there were two Vietnamese governments claiming jurisdiction
over all of Vietnam.
But Paris was preoccupied with the failure of three governments within two
months, from July to September, and many Vietnamese politicians stepped away
from Nguyen Van Xuan’s government, which, despite the changed name, was
primarily comprised of a residue of French and Vietnamese Cochinchina separat-
ists. It took several weeks for French policy to regain momentum. In October,
Bollaert was replaced with Léon Pignon (1908–1976). Pignon was a career
colonial administrator who had been in Indochina since1945. He had assisted
in negotiating the Franco-Vietnamese agreement of March6, 1946, and had been
a principal advisor of d’Argenlieu. Bollaert did not trust Pignon because of his
association with d’Argenlieu’s policies, and Pignon was assigned to Cambodia
during Bollaert’s tenure.

Pignon was a strong advocate of setting up a Vietnamese government under
Bao Dai to rally the non-communist Vietnamese. He believed that such a gov-
ernment could be given a countenance of sovereignty while France retained
control of vital state functions. With his support, the Elysée Agreement was
signed in March1949, granting Vietnam independence and unity but reserving
to France control of financial, economic, diplomatic, and military affairs and
creating an autonomous territory for non-Vietnamese peoples in the Central
Highlands. It took nearly a year before this agreement was fully ratified into
law by the French National Assembly. Legal issues related to Cochinchina as a
separate jurisdiction were finally resolved in June1949, and at that time Bao Dai
inaugurated his government in Saigon as the State of Vietnam. But not until
February1950 did the French National Assembly ratify the entire agreement.
Outstanding issues were slated to be resolved in future negotiations.
Bao Dai’s State of Vietnam rallied most of the heterogeneous groups in
Cochinchina. While Cao Dai leaders were hostile to the French and wavered
between support of Saigon governments and wartime neutrality, in1949 they
firmly supported Bao Dai. The Viet Minh murder of Huynh Phu So in1947 had
made the Viet Minh an enemy of the Hoa Hao. The French subsequently enlisted
the Hoa Hao to maintain security in western Cochinchina. There was a pattern
of dissention among Hoa Hao leaders, but most pledged their support to Bao
Dai. An organization of river pirates in the Saigon–Cholon area had emerged in
September 1945 as allies of the Viet Minh and thereafter became a local eco-
nomic and political force called the Binh Xuyen. The Binh Xuyen pledged loyalty
to Bao Dai and subsequently prospered under his patronage, eventually com-
manding both the criminal underworld and the police of the metropolitan area.
Although Catholics in the north overwhelmingly supported the Viet Minh until
1950, Catholic militias had formed in the south for protection against Viet Minh
attacks and gave their allegiance to Bao Dai.
Radicalization of the Viet Minh
Nguyen Binh, the Viet Minh leader in Cochinchina, continued a guerrilla war
against the French and against the groups supporting Bao Dai until his death in
1951. He was able to establish bases in less-populated areas where the Hoa Hao
or Cao Dai were not strong: in the Ca Mau region of the extreme south and in
the swampy Dong Thap Muoi region west of Saigon along the Cambodian
border.
The other main center of Viet Minh strength outside of northern Vietnam was
in Quang Ngai, where the communist leadership had been relatively radical since

1945.I n 1946 a Viet Minh military academy was established in Quang Ngai
under the leadership of Nguyen Son (1908–1956) and several Japanese officers
who chose to remain in Indochina to fight the French. Nguyen Son, originally
from a Hanoi suburb, had joined the Chinese Communist Party in the1920s and
by the1940s had risen to the top level of leadership among Chinese communists.
He returned to Vietnam in1945, bringing with him ideas about self-criticism and
individual rectification for nurturing the new socialist personality. He was in
Quang Ngai for only about a year, but his influence strengthened the Communist
Party in Quang Ngai and made this province the revolutionary vanguard of the
central coast.
In late 1947 and early 1948, a series of events led to the realignment of
Vietnamese communist policies away from the national front concept and
toward the international communist movement and revolutionary class struggle.
At a plenum of the Vietnamese communist leadership in January1948, three new
aspects of thought and policy were addressed: the Zhdanov Doctrine, land
reform, and party membership. In September1947, one of Stalin’s confidants,
Andrei Zhdanov (1896–1948), founded what came to be called the Cominform
(Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers’ Parties) as a new Cold
War version of the Comintern, which had been disbanded during the Second
World War. Zhdanov announced what became known as the Zhdanov Doctrine
asserting that the world was divided into two antagonistic camps: the imperialist
forces led by the United States and the socialist democratic forces led by the
Soviet Union. Although his ideas were formulated primarily in the realm of
culture, their political implications were obvious: there could be no compromise
with class enemies of the revolution. The Vietnamese plenum cited and acknow-
ledged the Zhdanov Doctrine.
By the end of1947, the Chinese communists were gaining victories in Man-
churia and turning the civil war in their favor. At that time, the Chinese were
implementing a radical program of homicidal land reform in parts of northern
and northeastern China, and Mao Zedong made announcements emphasizing
the importance of land reform in the struggle against anti-revolutionary enemies.
Although the Vietnamese communists were not yet in a position to initiate such
an ambitious land policy, their plenum in early1948 nevertheless took an
important step in that direction by calling for the confiscation of the land and
property of“traitors.” Although in Viet Minh terminology“traitors” were those
who served the French, in communist terms they were class enemies of the
revolution. In1948 the two definitions of“traitors” began to be conflated by
Vietnamese communist officials, hardening the boundary between the party and
the front. Increasingly from this time, those who had joined the Viet Minh out of
patriotism rather than commitment to communist revolution were marginalized.

This was a serious problem for the Vietnamese communists, because in
1945 and 1946 it had been necessary to allot several government ministries to
non-communists, in particular those dealing with education, trade, agriculture,
irrigation, and justice. After the Viet Minh government was driven into the
mountains in1947, the usefulness of non-communist urban intellectuals and
French-trained professionals in these ministries declined. Yet, in the adminis-
tration of justice, lawyers and judges continued to advocate an independent
judiciary to the chagrin of communist leaders, and the court system threatened
to thwart policies advocated by the party.
In the rush of patriotic enthusiasm that accompanied the August Revolution
and the outbreak of war, party ranks had more than tripled with thousands of
people whose commitment to communism was lukewarm or non-existent. After
the party had been ostensibly abolished in November1945, it continued to exist
as a structure of command and status within the Viet Minh front. By late1947,
when there was no longer any discernible benefit in displaying a moderate visage
to the French, the party began to change course.
The plenum of early1948 decided to restrict new members to people from
correct class backgrounds, such as soldiers, workers, peasants, and ethnic minor-
ities. Furthermore, new members would be required to undergo a period of
training and indoctrination. The idea was to build up a new core of obedient
and ideologically reliable party members who would eventually overwhelm those
who had rallied to the Viet Minh in1945, 1946, and1947 for mainly patriotic
reasons. This arousal of struggle within the party was gradual until1950 when
the arrival of Chinese communists on the border enabled the Vietnamese com-
munists to take a more peremptory attitude toward non-party colleagues in the
Viet Minh. Until then, the communists sought to retain the loyalty of people who
were susceptible to the Bao Dai appeal.
Beginning in1948, Vietnamese communists aligned their party rhetoric with
the Cold War terminology of international communism, making social revolu-
tion the foundation of national liberation and espousing the Marxist-Leninist
“new democracy” being hailed in China and Eastern Europe. The decline of the
left in France dispelled the mirage of a potential ally there, and the Bao Dai
phenomenon sharpened the need to combat Vietnamese enemies as well as the
French. However, as long as the Vietnamese communists remained isolated from
potential allies, they could not afford to frighten away their non-communist
followers.
In February 1948, Viet Minh representatives attended two meetings in Cal-
cutta: the Second Congress of the Communist Party of India, which announced a
new emphasis on class struggle, and the Conference of Youth and Students of
Southeast Asia Fighting for Freedom and Independence, which was organized by

groups associated with Soviet propaganda operations. Shortly after these meet-
ings, there was an upsurge of communist activity in Burma, Malaya, and Indo-
nesia. For the Vietnamese communists, the Calcutta meetings and their sequels
added plausibility to the prospect of being part of an international movement.
But it was the communist victory in the Chinese civil war that fundamentally
altered the situation.
Chinese communist army units began to accumulate on the Sino-Vietnamese
border in late 1949, and in December Ho Chi Minh set out for Beijing. In
January both Mao Zedong’s People’s Republic of China and the Soviet Union
announced diplomatic recognition of Ho Chi Minh’s Democratic Republic of
Vietnam. From Beijing, Ho Chi Minh continued on to Moscow to meet with
Stalin. Stalin released some limited military equipment for transport to Vietnam,
but the main burden for assisting the Vietnamese was assigned to the Chinese. By
April1950 a Chinese Military Advisory Group (CMAG) had been formed and
Vietnamese military units were soon being trained in Yunnan and Guangxi as
Chinese supplies and advisors began to arrive in Vietnam.
During the spring and summer of1950, the Viet Minh proclaimed a general
mobilization and conducted a series of activities to promote the recruitment of
people into their ranks. By the end of the summer around twenty thousand
troops had been trained and equipped in China. In September and October, a
system of French forts and installations along the Sino-Vietnamese border were
overrun, expelling the French from the uplands. This was followed by a series of
major attacks into the Red River lowlands that continued for most of1951. The
military situation rapidly shifted against the French with the rise of the People’s
Republic of China.
The political situation also changed rapidly once the lifeline to foreign allies
was established. In February and March 1951, the Second Congress of the
Indochinese Communist Party was held in Tuyen Quang Province with around
two hundred delegates (the first party congress had been held in1935 in Macau).
This congress created separate parties for Cambodia and Laos under the super-
vision of the Vietnamese party, which was renamed the Vietnamese Labor Party
to indicate a new emphasis on class struggle in line with Chinese communist
doctrine, which was strongly supported by Truong Chinh, the party secretary
general. At the same time, the Viet Minh front had become so closely associated
with its communist leadership that it no longer served as a“front organization,”
so it, along with the Vietnamese Labor Party, was merged into the Lien Viet
front that had been organized in1946 to bring various groups into alliance with
the Viet Minh.
However, this effort to withdraw the Viet Minh behind an ostensibly more
inclusive Lien Viet front did not have its desired effect. The movement of people

from upland resistance bases to French-controlled areas, especially educated
professionals and people from inconveniently non-revolutionary class back-
grounds, previously a small but growing number, now became a significant shift
of population. Most of these people dropped out of politics, being unwilling to
follow either the communists or the French. They added to the ranks of those
waiting for national independence without either communism or colonialism,
those who were calledattentistes, “those who wait,” in French andtrum chan,
“those who cover their heads with a blanket,” in Vietnamese.
The most respected leader of these people was Ngo Dinh Diem, an uncom-
promising nationalist and anti-communist. He had repeatedly warned Bao Dai
against making a settlement with the French that compromised true independ-
ence. He believed that the Elysée Agreement was a sham and refused to be
associated with it. In August1950, when he heard rumors that the Viet Minh
had issued instructions for his assassination, he left the country and by the end of
the year was living in the United States.
The beginning of United States involvement
Until1950, the United States was uninvolved in the Vietnamese conflict. While
supportive of France as a Cold War ally in Europe, the Truman administration
refrained from providing direct assistance to French operations in Indochina, not
wanting to be associated with what it viewed as a colonial policy. In early1949,
with the ongoing Berlin Blockade, the United States was concerned to obtain full
French participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. American
policymakers worried about the large representation of the French Communist
Party in the French National Assembly and the instability of Fourth Republic
governments. Although the American State Department considered the Elysée
Agreement to be significantly less than the granting of independence and insuffi-
cient to rally Vietnamese nationalists, the United States kept these doubts to itself
in view of the importance of France to American policy in Europe. But with the
communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the recognition of Ho Chi
Minh’s government by the Chinese and Soviet governments, the Cold War came
to Asia, and the United States could no longer stand aloof. In February1950,
days after the French National Assembly ratified the Elysée Agreement, the
United States and the United Kingdom announced diplomatic recognition of
Bao Dai’s State of Vietnam.
There was a contradiction at the center of American policy toward the Viet-
namese situation, which was an extension of the contradiction at the center of
French policy. Was France fighting to create a non-communist independent

Vietnam or to retain some form of neo-colonial control? Despite talk to the
contrary, French behavior revealed that the answer to this question was the
latter. For its part, the United States wanted France to grant Bao Dai’s govern-
ment the genuine independence required to compete with communists for the
nationalist cause and to build a Vietnamese army able to take over the war, but it
did not believe that it could force France to do this without erasing French
incentive to continue the war and without risking a breakdown in the Cold
War alliance. Beginning already in the late1940s and continuing through
1950, various studies and memos produced in the American Departments of
State and Defense debated the benefits and liabilities of getting involved in the
Vietnamese war with cogent arguments on each side of the issue. However, the
communist victory in China and concern about the extension of communist
regimes elsewhere in Asia became the decisive consideration, overriding doubts
raised by the afterlife of French colonialism.
Once the decision was made to grant diplomatic recognition to the Bao Dai
government in February 1950, American involvement developed rapidly. In
March, following a French request for help, President Truman released money
previously allocated by Congress for“the non-communist areas of China,” the
first direct American funding for the French in Indochina. A mission sent to study
French needs in Indochina reported that much greater assistance would be
required. The outbreak of the Korean War in June appeared to American policy-
makers as a second front in China’s promotion of communist regimes in neigh-
boring countries and accelerated plans to send assistance to Vietnam.
In July, the United States sent another mission to survey conditions in Vietnam.
The report of this mission was pessimistic about the military situation, which it
considered to be a stalemate in which the French were taking unsustainable
casualties. It asserted that the war could not be won militarily and that the main
problem required a political settlement that the French were unwilling to make.
Because of the urgency of the situation, the report nevertheless recommended the
formation of a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to fill French
military needs and to build a Vietnamese army. Despite French objections to
the presence of an American MAAG, which they viewed as an unnecessary
infringement upon their prerogatives, the United States established a MAAG in
Saigon in the autumn of1950 to deliver, account for, and evaluate the use of
military material provided to the French.
American policy was aimed at providing what was necessary to keep the
French military from defeat while maximizing the possibilities of building a
Vietnamese army and government administration within the constraints imposed
by the French. With this in view, in addition to the MAAG, the United States set
up a Special Technical and Economic Mission (STEM) to work directly with the

Bao Dai government on civilian development projects. This irritated the French,
who suspected that the Americans were seeking to displace them.
At the beginning of1950, Bao Dai appointed Nguyen Phan Long, the veteran
Constitutionalist politician of the1920s and 1930s, as prime minister of the
Saigon government. Nguyen Phan Long called for full independence, for Ameri-
can aid to be given directly to his government, and for rapidly building up a
Vietnamese army. He had no personal political following, so it was easy for the
French to obtain his replacement in April1950 by the governor of Cochinchina,
Tran Van Huu (1896–1984), a French citizen, wealthy landowner, and former
partisan of the Cochinchina separatist movement. Despite his background, Tran
Van Huu strained at the French leash to enlarge the Saigon government’s
authority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the Elysée Agreement, the French
acquiesced to his opening diplomatic relations with the United States, the United
Kingdom, Thailand, India, and other countries.
In June 1950, Tran Van Huu began what turned out to be five months of
difficult negotiations at Pau in southwestern France with representatives of
France and the other two associated states of Indochina, Cambodia and Laos.
The agenda was to resolve issues remaining from the Elysée Agreement that were
ostensibly to be handled at the federal level of the Indochinese Federation:
communications, immigration, customs, foreign trade, and finance. Cambodia
and Laos supported French involvement in these matters from fear of being
dominated by their Vietnamese neighbor. Tran Van Huu vainly appealed to
the Americans and British to pressure France to be more accommodating to the
Vietnamese. The arrangements that were ultimately reached appeared to repre-
sent a compromise among all the concerned parties, but, when implemented, the
French gave up very little of their control.

Americans and stymied any effort to raise the credibility of the State of
Vietnam in what, beneath the surface of France’s persistently colonial attitude
and of the United States’ Cold War agenda, was becoming more and more of
a civil war among Vietnamese. During his two years as prime minister, Tran
Van Huu became more nationalistic and revealed an increasing willingness to
work directly with the United States, prompting French chagrin. In June1952,
the French obtained his repl acement by Nguyen Van Tam ( 1893–1990),
another French citizen and former Cochinchina separatist, who had made a
reputation in military and security affairs. Nguyen Van Tam demonstrated
subservience to French interests and to the commandeering style of Jean
Letourneau (1907–1986), who combined the ministerial post in charge of
the Indochinese associate states with the post of high commissioner for most
of1952 and 1953.

The military situation from1950 to 1953, with the additional participation of
China and the United States, attained a new level of stalemate. The French loss of
their Sino-Vietnamese border forts in late1950 prompted the appointment of a
well-known and respected Second World War military leader to both command
the armed forces and be high commissioner: Jean Joseph Marie Gabriel de Lattre
de Tassigny (1889–1952). During1951, Vo Nguyen Giap launched three major
attacks from the mountains into the lowlands of the Red River, first from the
north, then from the east, and finally from the southwest. De Lattre defeated all
of these offensives with American logistical assistance. He built a string of forts
along the edge of the deltaic plains to insulate the lowlands from the mountains.
Known as the“de Lattre line,” this defensive formation did not prevent routine
communist infiltration of the plains, but de Lattre’s strong personality and
competent leadership briefly raised French morale.
De Lattre mixed talk of a truly independent Vietnam and measures to build up
the State of Vietnam’s army with acts that guarded French supremacy, such as
vetoing a bilateral aid agreement between the Saigon government and the United
States. Nevertheless, the United States was sufficiently impressed with his
achievements to significantly accelerate the military supply line to Vietnam. After
he died of cancer in January1952, his successor was unable to sustain his
moment of optimism, and French public opinion began to turn against the
war. A series of military setbacks in1952 spread gloom among French
policymakers.
By January1953, when René Mayer (1895–1972) became Prime Minister of
France and Dwight David Eisenhower (1890–1969) became President of the
United States, French war weariness and American skepticism of French policy
had reached new levels of seriousness. In Vietnam, the French were mostly
ascendant from Nha Trang south. Aside from that, they tenuously held a coastal
strip from Da Nang to Dong Hoi, and in the Red River plain they held major
cities and towns and were dominant in much of the countryside. French forces
were for the most part tied down in static defensive positions and strongly
invested in road-bound supply operations. They lacked sufficient manpower to
undertake offensive operations and were slow to expand and train the Vietnam-
ese army. When Mayer requested increased American funding for the war, the
Eisenhower administration responded that before considering the request it
would be necessary to see a French plan for defeating the enemy within two
years.
Mayer and Letourneau visited Washington, DC, in March to make their
request in person. Discovering that Eisenhower was serious about wanting to
see a plan, Letourneau proposed a three-step scenario of building up the Viet-
namese army to secure the south, of consolidating French forces in the north, and

then of taking the offensive to finish the war in1955. The Americans accepted
this plan despite doubts and reservations.
In June, the newly appointed French commander, Henri Eugène Navarre
(1898–1983), produced an accelerated version of the Letourneau plan that
envisioned offensive operations as early as the autumn of 1953.T h en e w
French government of Joseph Laniel ( 1889–1975) publicly embraced this
Navarre plan and indicated that substantial reinforcements would be sent from
France. The Laniel government was a finely balanced coalition that included
four former prime ministers, each with his own analysis of the Indochinese
situation and his own circle of experts. French policy lost coherence as it
entered a phase of keeping up wartime appearances while seeking a way to
negotiate an end to the fighting. The idea of obtaining a favorable battlefield
position from which to negotiate became the most plausible way to portray
French policy under Laniel.
Reinforcements sent to Navarre were negligible, and he was left to his own
devices. Although American officers assigned to the MAAG in Saigon reported
that they could see no evidence of the Navarre plan being implemented, Navarre
was determined to do what he could with available resources to demonstrate the
aggressive intent of his plan. He was inhibited by elements in the Laniel govern-
ment eager to negotiate an end to the conflict and that adjusted the adminis-
trative hierarchy in Indochina to increase civilian control over the military.
Paul Reynaud (1878–1966), a former prime minister prominent in the Laniel
government, obtained the appointment of Maurice Dejean (1899–1982), then
ambassador to Japan, to replace Letourneau. Reynaud had been Minister of
Colonies in the early1930s and had visited Indochina in the wake of the Nghe-
Tinh soviet uprising. He was now in favor of negotiating an end to the war and
estimated that Dejean, who had been a subordinate of his for a time in the late
1930s, would be an appropriate person to oversee matters in Indochina. Dejean,
a career diplomat, would be disgraced in the1960s after a scandal while serving
as ambassador to the Soviet Union amid rumors that he had been recruited by
Soviet intelligence during the Second World War or even earlier. There were
stories of friction between him and Navarre because he was supposedly holding
back the allocation of resources in accordance with a shadow policy of the Laniel
government to minimize military operations while stalling for negotiations.
Although both men publicly denied that this was the case, their sensing the need
to do so revealed that French policy toward the war was shifting. In early July
1953, the Laniel government informed the associated states of Indochina that it
was ready to discuss“the transfer of powers” and “the perfecting of independ-
ence and sovereignty.” This, combined with the departure of Letourneau’s heavy
hand, brought Saigon politics to life with new energy.

The peace settlement
By1953, the State of Vietnam had become an agglomeration of several elements.
A cluster of politicians, most of whom had been part of the Cochinchina separat-
ist scheme of d’Argenlieu, gathered in Saigon around Prime Minister Nguyen
Van Tam. The Binh Xuyen was a crime syndicate in Saigon and Cholon in
alliance with the Corsican mafia that handled the opium traffic. The Hoa Hao
was ascendant in western Cochinchina. The main Cao Dai leadership at Tay
Ninh was allied with Bao Dai, but splinter groups followed the Viet Minh or the
maverick general Trinh Minh The (1922–1955), who opposed both the Viet
Minh and the French. The Dai Viet Party was dominant in Tonkin except for the
Catholic bishoprics of Phat Diem and Bui Chu near the coast south of Hanoi,
which governed their own affairs. Bao Dai resided in Dalat surrounded by his
favorites, one of whom one was General Nguyen Van Hinh (1915–2004), son of
Nguyen Van Tam, a French citizen, and a former major in the French air force,
now serving as commander of the Vietnamese army.
The remaining element was a disparate collection of people unwilling to
participate in the false independence of the State of Vietnam and who were
“waiting” for an opportunity to press for total independence. A leading figure
among these was Ngo Dinh Nhu (1910–1963), a younger brother of Ngo Dinh
Diem. Ngo Dinh Nhu had studied in France in the1930s and, influenced by ideas
of progressive French Catholic philosophers, endeavored to articulate an alter-
native to the extremes of communist collectivism and capitalist individualism.
Ngo Dinh Nhu rejected both the“masses” (quan chung) of communist ideol-
ogy and the “individual” (ca nhan) of capitalism. He advocated instead the
“person” (nhan vi) who both cooperated with others and retained an autono-
mous personal identity. His ideology, commonly translated as“personalism”
and generally conflated with the“personalism” of Emmanuel Mounier (1905–
1950), who influenced his thought, is probably more correctly translated as
“personism” with its emphasis on the dignity of each person in the context of
collective self-help. It was an adaptation of French“personalism” to an Asian
society emerging from colonialism into the modern world.
Ngo Dinh Nhu aimed for a society based neither on submersion into the mass
nor the isolation of individuality but rather on the integrity of persons who take
responsibility for each other. He rejected the communist term for“labor” (lao
dong) that was used in the communist party name, Vietnamese Labor Party
(Dang Lao Dong Viet Nam), because it derives from a classical expression
meaning to mobilize or to rouse to action, which implies labor under the pressure
of an external authority. He preferred the termcan lao, which derives from a

classical expression meaning a willingness to work without coercion, which can
be translated as“diligence.” Ngo Dinh Diem easily understood these ideas, for
he believed that neither the coercive collectivism of communism nor the alienat-
ing individualism of capitalism was a suitable model for his vision of a modern
Vietnamese society.
After Ngo Dinh Diem went into exile in1950, Ngo Dinh Nhu began to speak
publicly about his ideas and to attract like-minded people. He lived for a time in
Dalat where he established contact with Bao Dai. In1953 he allied with a Saigon
trade union leader and began to organize labor unions. He became a spokesman
for those seeking total independence from the French. Before Bao Dai departed
for France in August to follow up the Laniel government’s July announcement,
Ngo Dinh Nhu met with him to discuss the Vietnamese negotiating position.
Nguyen Van Tam was discredited, and under Dejean the French grip on
Vietnamese political life had loosened. In early September, Ngo Dinh Nhu, along
with the Cao Dai leader Pham Cong Tac (1890–1969), organized a congress in
Cholon that included around fifty delegates from the Cao Dai, the Hoa Hao, the
Binh Xuyen, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, the Dai Viet Nationalist Party,
and various Catholic groups. After lively debates, the delegates called for uncon-
ditional independence and a national assembly elected by universal suffrage. This
congress brought to the surface widely shared opinions that had previously been
pushed down by the French. Although it was an ad hoc event and lacked any
official government standing, it opened political space and enabled Bao Dai to
convene another congress in October. This congress, representing Bao Dai’s
government, called for total independence and sovereignty, rejected membership
in the French Union in its current form, rejected any negotiated settlement made
by an international conference that was not approved by the Saigon government,
and designated Bao Dai to conduct negotiations with the French.
Nguyen Van Tam resigned in December and, in January 1954, Bao Dai
appointed his cousin Buu Loc (1914–1990) to be prime minister. Meanwhile, the
Laniel government was envisioning the prospect of negotiations with the Viet Minh
as well, and the contradiction of simultaneously dealing with Bao Dai and HoChi
Minh created difficulties for the French. The cases of Laos and Cambodia were
simpler, and France concluded treaties granting independence to those countries by
the end of1953. When Buu Loc finally began negotiations with the French in early
March of1954, he discovered that the French were still not ready to take up his
agenda. Within days, these negotiations were overshadowed by militaryevents in
Vietnam and by the impending international conference at Geneva, which had
developed from the easing of Cold War tensions after Stalin’s death.

lack of progress in expanding the Vietnamese army to the extent necessary for his

plan, was under pressure from both the Americans and his own government to
act, from the Americans to show evidence that his plan was still alive and from
Paris to improve the French negotiating position. In November1953 he began to
garrison the valley of Dien Bien Phu, three hundred kilometers west of Hanoi
near the Laotian border. There were five plausible reasons for this move, but they
were unlikely to have been decisive without Navarre’s need to demonstrate some
kind of offensive operation as envisioned by his plan.
Dien Bien Phu was a major junction for routes between Vietnam, Laos, and
China, and one reason for garrisoning this place was to inhibit the movement of
enemy troops from Vietnam into Laos, as had occurred in the spring of1953,
which had distracted the French from Vietnamese battlefields to the defense of
Laos. A second reason for going to Dien Bien Phu was to establish a base for
offensive operations to bring the war into the enemy’s territory. Related to this
was a third consideration: to more effectively support and maximize the guerrilla
operations of France’s Tai allies in that region. A fourth idea was that a base at
Dien Bien Phu would attract suicidal enemy attacks that could be destroyed by
French firepower, as had happened the previous year at a mountain base named
Na San. Finally, Dien Bien Phu was a major center of the opium trade, which was
coveted by both the communists and the French. Controlling this place would
deny a large source of income to the enemy and ensure that it came into French
hands instead. But most important, the garrisoning of Dien Bien Phu was
intended to restore a sense of mobility and an offensive spirit to an army that
had become passive and road-bound.
The main problem with Dien Bien Phu was that it could be supplied only by
air, and its distance from French airfields was near the limit of the amount of fuel
a plane could carry for a return trip. This was not a serious problem so long as
the Dien Bien Phu airfield was serviceable. More serious was that, by itself,
without reinforcements or a major growth of the Vietnamese army, it took
limited resources away from other priorities. This may not have been a factor
if more men had been available and the move to Dien Bien Phu had promptly
developed into a more general occupation of the surrounding area and pro-
gressed to threaten communist supply lines from China. However, contrary to
French expectations, Vo Nguyen Giap rather quickly surrounded Dien Bien Phu
and installed heavy artillery in the mountains overlooking it. Once the battle
began in mid March, the airfield was unusable and Dien Bien Phu became a trap
for the French. The Eisenhower administration was uninterested in intervening
militarily, and Dien Bien Phu fell to the communists one day before the Geneva
conference took up the Vietnamese issue on May8.
The fall of Dien Bien Phu, although not militarily decisive, broke the
French will to continue the war. But even at this point, the issue of

acknowledging Vietnamese independence remained unresolved. Under American
pressure, a treaty granting independence to the State of Vietnam had been
completed by late April, but the French delayed signing it. Negotiations were
about to begin at Geneva, where Ho Chi Minh’s government would also be
represented, and, as long as the independence treaty with the State of Vietnam
remained unsigned, the French could negotiate with the communists on behalf of
the Saigon government without its approval.
However, Laniel’s thinking about this changed somewhat in late May after
Bao Dai summoned Ngo Dinh Diem from Belgium, where he was residing, and
arranged for him to replace Buu Loc in June. Ngo Dinh Diem was famously anti-
French and Laniel expected that dealing with him would be more difficult than
with Buu Loc. At the same time, however, by late May it was clear to the French
that a partition of Vietnam would be a fundamental part of the settlement. This
was strongly opposed by Bao Dai, Ngo Dinh Diem, and other representatives of
the State of Vietnam. Laniel accordingly wanted to get the independence issue
out of the way without fanfare before the people around Bao Dai learned of the
partition issue. Consequently, on June4, Laniel and Buu Loc initialed the
independence treaty, but it was not ratified with the signatures of Bao Dai and
the French president. Nine days later, Laniel resigned and, four days after that,
Pierre Mendès-France (1907–1982) became prime minister with the pledge to
obtain a peace agreement within a month. Mendès-France had no intention of
observing any assurances that had previously been made to the State of Vietnam
about not negotiating a settlement without its approval.
France ostensibly released its colonial claim on Vietnam only at the last
possible moment, after years of tortuous negotiations, in the calamity of repudi-
ating a costly war, as a subsidiary aspect of larger diplomatic maneuvers, and
with the anticipated embarrassment of breaking promises. And even then, it was
not done, for the independence treaty would never be ratified. All the same, the
State of Vietnam began to act as if it had been ratified and to establish relations
directly with the United States, the only major power with a serious interest in its
future. Ngo Dinh Diem had already left for Vietnam when Bao Dai proclaimed
him as prime minister in mid June.
France, the People’s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United
Kingdom were the major negotiating powers at Geneva. The Soviet Union and
the United Kingdom were the co-conveners of the conference and drove the
agenda. China posed as mentor and patron of its Vietnamese ally. Desperate
for a settlement before his self-imposed deadline of thirty days, Mendès-France
acted for France and left the newly independent Indochinese associated states to
manage on their own. The interests of Cambodia and Laos, each of which had
only one government, were generally observed by the major powers. The State of

Vietnam, however, was an orphan. The United States, while attending the
conference, stood to one side, seeking to minimize being implicated in what it
understood as a Cold War defeat. Its presence offstage, however, was an import-
ant influence on the outcome and confirmed the need to partition Vietnam
between its two governments not just to end the current war but more import-
antly to prevent the outbreak of a new war.
It was obvious to nearly all the major powers that the only way to remove the
likelihood of Vietnam again becoming a place of crisis in the Cold War was to
separate the two Vietnamese governments, each in its own territory. However,
Vietnamese of all political persuasions opposed a permanent partition of the
country. Consequently, the expedient of a unification election in the future was
contrived to conveniently dispose of the issue. Except for France, the major
powers subsequently showed no further interest in the matter, understanding
that Vietnam could not be united without war, and more war was what they
hoped to preclude. Nothing of the Geneva settlement was signed except for
ceasefire arrangements by mid-level representatives of the French and Demo-
cratic Republic of Vietnam’s armies, thereby demonstrating the studied ambigu-
ity of a document that affirmed the sovereign independence and unity of a
country that it also partitioned between two rival armies and governments.
Mendès-France revealed the persistence of colonial habits by neglecting to
ratify the independence treaty that had been initialed by Laniel and Buu Loc in
early June, claiming that to do so would violate the Geneva provision for an
election to unify the country and that, until the election was held, France was still
responsible for southern Vietnam. At the same time he sent an envoy to Hanoi to
sign a commercial treaty with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that acknow-
ledged French economic and cultural interests. He seemingly imagined that, by
maintaining the upper hand in southern Vietnam until the elections, France could
produce an electoral result that unified Vietnam under Hanoi while preserving
French influence. Even after his resignation in February1955, the momentum of
French efforts to direct Saigon politics continued for another three months.
For his part, Ngo Dinh Diem regarded the State of Vietnam as fully independ-
ent and considered the Geneva agreement to be a vestige of French colonialism,
having been negotiated without the participation or approval of his government.
While he publicly accepted the line of partition, he would have nothing to do
with unification elections, which he viewed as impossible in a northern Vietnam
ruled by a communist regime and as an opportunity for France to continue its
pretensions of sovereignty.

13 FROM TWO COUNTRIES TO ONE
Saigon
After Bao Dai went to France in late1953 to pursue possibilities for negotiating
full independence with the Laniel government, Ngo Dinh Diem departed the
United States for Europe, sensing that he may find a role in the changing
situation. Ngo Dinh Diem’s youngest brother, Ngo Dinh Luyen (1914–1990),
was a childhood friend of Bao Dai from their schoolboy days in France and
served as a go-between. Although Bao Dai had never been comfortable with Ngo
Dinh Diem’s strong anti-French attitude, in May1954 he turned to him because
there was no other person of his stature and reputation as an uncompromising
nationalist. Furthermore, Ngo Dinh Nhu’s emergence as a political figure in
Saigon the previous year suggested that Ngo Dinh Diem had a point of access
into the political world of the State of Vietnam. Two other considerations were
apparently on Bao Dai’s mind. Ngo Dinh Diem’s appointment would apply
pressure on the French to sign the independence treaty, and no other Vietnamese
politician was likely to elicit the American assistance that would be necessary for
the future of his government. However, Bao Dai soon realized that with the
appointment of Ngo Dinh Diem he had ended his role in the political life of his
country, and he never returned to Vietnam.
In the summer of 1954, Ngo Dinh Diem was seemingly without any firm
source of support. The United States was beginning to provide institutional
assistance but was non-committal regarding Ngo Dinh Diem himself, being
unsure of whether he would be able to surmount the daunting situation in
Saigon. The French army had regrouped to southern Vietnam and was still the
pre-eminent military force in the country. The French military commander and
commissioner in Vietnam was General Paul Henri Romuald Ély (1897–1975),
who made no secret of his opinion that Ngo Dinh Diem should be replaced. The
French continued to insist that American military assistance to the Vietnamese
army be channeled through them. General Nguyen Van Hinh, commander of the

Vietnamese army, publicly affirmed his intention to depose Ngo Dinh Diem until
Bao Dai was persuaded to recall him to France in October. The various sect
armies continued to receive subsidies from the French and showed little regard
for Ngo Dinh Diem’s authority. In May1954, Bao Dai had sold control of the
Saigon–Cholon police to the Binh Xuyen gangsters, and they, with the covert
support of the French, were determined to resist Ngo Dinh Diem’s authority.
Concerned about the direction of French activities in Saigon, the Eisenhower
administration sent a senior French-speaking army general to Vietnam with
ambassadorial rank, Joseph Lawton Collins (1896–1987), thereby providing
an American peer of Ély. Collins and Ély worked well together and negotiated
an arrangement for Americans to participate in training the Vietnamese army.
Collins was susceptible to Ély’s negative evaluation of Ngo Dinh Diem, however,
and, in the spring of1955, he began to report his opinion that Ngo Dinh Diem
should be replaced.
This came during several weeks of crisis during which a coalition of sect armies
led by the Binh Xuyen openly challenged Ngo Dinh Diem, seemingly with French
encouragement. Against this threat, Ngo Dinh Diem rallied army units and sect
leaders such as the Cao Dai maverick Trinh Minh The. The Binh Xuyen was
destroyed and its allied sect armies were driven into the countryside. The United
States promptly made a commitment to support Ngo Dinh Diem and, in May
1955, informed France that thereafter it would no longer consult about Viet-
namese affairs. Within a year, all remaining French forces were evacuated and
the French command in Vietnam was abolished, although French advisors to the
navy and air force did not depart until1957.
Ngo Dinh Diem stood for those who had had enough of French colonialism
and its decaying residue, and he did not shrink from entering and mastering the
ruthless world of Saigon politics. France never ratified the independence treaty
initialed by Joseph Laniel and Buu Loc on June4, 1954. Furthermore, Ngo Dinh
Diem understood that his government would not be free of France until its link to
Bao Dai was broken, for many aspiring Saigon politicians continued to shelter
under Bao Dai’s Francophile wings. Consequently, in October1955 he staged a
referendum to remove Bao Dai as head of state. The public campaign and voting
procedure for this referendum was used to spread popular awareness of the new
government and its break with the French past. With Bao Dai and his quasi-
monarchical and colonial aura out of the way, Ngo Dinh Diem proclaimed the
Republic of Vietnam. This was a declaration of independence from France.
In March1956, elections were held for a constituent assembly, which drew up
a constitution and then sat as a national assembly until legislative elections under
the new constitution were held in1959. Ngo Dinh Nhu had organized the quasi-
clandestine Revolutionary Personalist Labor Party (Can Lao Nhan Vi Cach

Mang Dang), which did not directly participate in elections but selected and
promoted candidates in allied parties, in particular the National Revolutionary
Movement (Quoc Gia Cach Mang Phong Trao), which served as a front organ-
ization. Three major parties that supported Ngo Dinh Diem won two-thirds of
the seats in the1956 elections. As would be true in all the elections held under the
1956 constitution, opposition candidates fared best in Saigon where the urban
and international environment was more congenial to constitutional freedoms
than in the countryside where the level of education and understanding of
democratic procedures was lower and where respect for those in power was
more ingrained and more efficiently enforced.
The Geneva agreement provided for the redeployment not only of armies but
also of civilians from one side of the armistice line to the other. Between eighty
and ninety thousand people embarked for the north on Soviet Bloc ships from the
two main areas ruled by communists: Ca Mau in the extreme south of the
Mekong plain and the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh region of the central coast.
Many of these people were youths selected for education in the north. Around
ten times this number of people shifted from the north to the south, one-third of
them transported by the United States navy. Two-thirds of the immigrants into
the south were Catholics, and Ngo Dinh Diem provided settlements for them in
localities along the northern edge of the Mekong plain.
The arrival of large numbers of northern immigrants both strengthened the
political base of Ngo Dinh Diem and introduced tension between northerners
and southerners and between Catholics and non-Catholics, partly from resent-
ment about resources devoted to the newcomers and partly from cultural differ-
ences between northerners and southerners. Southerners perceived northerners
as“pushy” while northerners perceived southerners as “lazy.” Furthermore,
Catholics tended to live in close-knit communities under ecclesiastical leadership
in a global hierarchy, which maximized their potential for economic success and
a relatively high standard of living. This, along with lines of patronage via the
Church to the Ngo Dinh family, inspired resentment among many non-
Catholics.
The departure of people from Ca Mau and the central coast was accompanied
by the extension of Saigon authority into those areas. During1955 and 1956, the
Republic of Vietnam launched a campaign to identify and eliminate communist
leaders who had stayed behind. A few hundred people were imprisoned or killed
in this“denounce the communist” (to cong) campaign. At the same time, Ngo
Dinh Diem introduced a modest agrarian policy that limited land rent for tenants
and the amount of land that any single person could own. According to redistri-
bution legislation, about one-third of all tenanted land in the country was to
be expropriated. Resistance from landowners and local officials inhibited

implementation, however, and only40 percent of this land was actually trans-
ferred to farmers. Ngo Dinh Diem espoused the idea of“collective advance,”
which aimed to bring improvements to rural life without radical or violent
measures, such as were then being used in the north. Even so, many landowners
were embittered by their loss of land, including the father of Ngo Dinh Nhu’s
wife, Tran Van Chuong (1898–1986), a career diplomat whom Ngo Dinh Diem
made ambassador to the United States. Although Ngo Dinh Diem tripled the
number of farmers owning land in the Mekong plain, the great disparity between
landowners and farmers that historically had characterized this region was not
significantly ameliorated.
One area that worried Ngo Dinh Diem was the Central Highlands, a vast
upland region sparsely inhabited by non-Vietnamese peoples along the Laotian
and Cambodian borders. He suspected that he had limited time to stabilize social
conditions and consolidate government authority in this remote region before the
communists became active there. The French had discouraged Vietnamese settle-
ment in the Central Highlands and had tried to preserve it as an autonomous
non-Vietnamese region. In1955, Ngo Dinh Diem initiated a program both to
settle Vietnamese in the highlands and to encourage peripatetic upland peoples to
make permanent settlements. In1957, the United States took an interest in the
program and allocated money for it but withdrew after a year because of
disagreements about how it was being implemented. Ngo Dinh Diem believed
the matter was urgent and that it was more important to encourage a spirit of
self-reliance among the people than to wait for the American bureaucracy to
complete its studies and its paperwork before releasing allocated funds. Before
his death, he had settled a quarter of a million Vietnamese in the Central
Highlands.
On their side, American aid officials criticized the Central Highlands program
for being too hasty, too disorderly, and too undemocratic, an analysis that
became the standard institutional view of Ngo Dinh Diem’s policies among the
American aid mission and embassy staff during the ambassadorship of Elbridge
Durbrow (1903–1997), who arrived in March of1957. On the other hand,
General Samuel Tankersley Williams (1896–1984), commander of MAAG since
October 1955, saw Ngo Dinh Diem as doing the best possible in a difficult
situation. Williams had a colorful and valorous career as a combat officer in both
World Wars and Korea. He respected Ngo Dinh Diem as a strong leader who
understood the priorities of his situation. Durbrow, a career diplomat without
prior experience in Asia, began to advocate a policy of“linkage” between
American aid and Vietnamese government “reforms.” Tension between
Durbrow and Williams over their divergent views was the beginning of a new
contradiction in American policy toward Vietnam that would eventually lead to

Ngo Dinh Diem’s death in 1963. To some extent, this contradiction was an
American version of the old French arguments about“assimilation,” turning
Vietnamese into French men and women or into Americans as the case may be,
and“association,” conceding space for the Vietnamese to develop their own way
within the relationship of colonialism or Cold War alliance, as the case may be.
Military personnel attached to MAAG stabilized at around650 men in early
1956, most being involved in training activities. The civilian aid establishment
attached to the American embassy, with exceptions, became a critical mass of
rotating people in culture shock, frustrated that Vietnamese did not act like
Americans. This, combined with a sense of power and global responsibility,
produced among many Americans a teachery attitude verging on the racist
condescension typical of a colonial relationship. Furthermore, while claiming
to be against colonialism, American policy appeared to dominate smaller coun-
tries through the flow of money and material goods, as demonstrated by the
manner in which the United States provided monetary assistance to the Saigon
government.
In 1955, the United States established the Commodity Import Program as the
means for transferring funds to Ngo Dinh Diem’s government. The United States
provided dollars for purchase by Vietnamese importers. The dollars were spent
in the United States for commodities, mainly consumer goods such as refriger-
ators, televisions, radios, stoves, air conditioners, and comestibles, which the
importers then sold in Vietnam. Importers bought dollars with Vietnamese
piastres at a fixed exchange rate that represented a subsidy for them. The piastres
were placed in a“counterpart fund” for use by the Vietnamese government.
Eighty percent of all American aid funds were provided through the Commodity
Import Program. This scheme was intended to control inflation, prevent dollars
from overwhelming the local economy, and keep taxes low. Negative effects
included the retardation of local manufacturing; creating a Vietnamese govern-
ment that was dependent on a foreign source of money rather than taxing its own
citizens; corruption in the licensing of importers; non-market exchange rates; and
the creation of an import-based urban consumer economy that artificially separ-
ated cities from the rest of the country.
The Commodity Import Program was controversial among Vietnamese. Phan
Quang Dan (b.1918), the main opposition politician in Saigon during the late
1950s, became well known for speaking out against the Commodity Import
Program. Originally from Nghe An, he became politically active in1945 and
chose to follow Bao Dai to China. Disappointed with Bao Dai’s lack of firmness
in dealing with the French, he tried to form his own party before going to the
United States, where he lived in exile until returning to Vietnam at the end of
the war.

Ngo Dinh Diem was also critical of the Commodity Import Program and tried
unsuccessfully to have aspects of it changed. The scheme created an institutional
dependency that made Durbrow’s “linkage” idea plausible as a way to force the
Vietnamese government to follow American advice. The ultimate example of this
occurred in October1963 when the suspension of the Commodity Import
Program was used as a signal to indicate American support for a conspiracy
against Ngo Dinh Diem. The Commodity Import Program was in principle and
in effect not very different from the manner in which Chinese and Soviet aid was
provided to the government in Hanoi, except that with two rival patrons the
northern government was in a better position to prevent either one from becom-
ing dominant.
Hanoi
After shifting its headquarters from the mountains to Hanoi in late1954, the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam received large amounts of aid from China and
the Soviet Union, including food, consumer goods, military and industrial equip-
ment, and money. But the greatest foreign presence in North Vietnamese domes-
tic affairs was Chinese supervision of the land reform program. Chinese
involvement in Vietnamese land reform was not an exercise of unwanted influ-
ence but rather the provision of expertise eagerly sought and gladly accepted by
the Vietnamese communist leadership. During the years of Chinese participation
in the French war and the tenure of Luo Guibo (1908–1995) as Chinese ambas-
sador from 1950 to 1954, a very close, albeit unequal, relationship was estab-
lished between the two communist parties. Communist success in China was an
object of admiration and emulation by the Vietnamese.
At the same time, there were reasons for land reform in Vietnam that had
nothing directly to do with the Chinese model. Truong Chinh, the leader of the
party since1940, had co-authored with Vo Nguyen Giap a study of rural
conditions, published in1937–1938 during the Popular Front period, entitled
Van De Dan Cay, “The Peasant Question.” This work portrayed rural society
with the five categories that became the basis for land reform in the1950s. It
described the system of landholding, taxation, and indebtedness that made
peasant life difficult, but also described the peasant“mentality” as indoctrinated
to accept exploitation through the influence of religious beliefs and an irrational
respect for private property. While Mao Zedong’s emphasis on the peasantry
may be detected here, the work is more generally the application of Marxist
analysis to the rural conditions in Vietnam, particularly northern Vietnam,
where it was written and published.

The view of peasant life inThe Peasant Questionis very similar to what was
portrayed in“realist” literature being published at that same time. For example,
Nguyen Cong Hoan’s Buoc Duong Cung(Impasse), published in1938, depicts
the tragedies of peasant oppression and attributes them to the stupidity of the
peasants themselves, who are illiterate, do not understand why their lives are so
bad, and have no idea about what to do. In1937, the communist poet To Huu
(1920–2002) publishedMo Coi(Orphan), which expressed deep sympathy with
the sufferings of the downtrodden. The Maoist idea of making revolution by
mobilizing poor peasants to overthrow rural tyranny did not come as news to
Vietnamese communists. Both China and Vietnam were overwhelmingly agrar-
ian countries and aspiring revolutionaries could not avoid that fact.
In the late1940s and early1950s, Truong Chinh pushed for ever more radical
rural policies as conditions permitted. Initially, during the first two years after the
August Revolution of1945, with the Chinese occupation and the outbreak of
war with France, he was content to call for rent and debt controls. Beginning in
1948, he ordered census and land ownership surveys as an initial step in
gathering information about rural conditions at the village level. This was
primarily aimed at the provinces with relatively large peasant populations that
were governed by the communists: Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ha
Tinh. With the arrival of Chinese allies in early1950, a flurry of decrees about
land policy included conducting a census to sort the rural population into the five
categories of landlord, rich peasant, middle peasant, poor peasant, and landless.
This produced resistance from local officials who claimed that people had been
incorrectly categorized, and a“rectification” was required later in the year. Local
party leaders were not yet ideologically motivated to follow land reform
instructions.
At the party congress in early 1951, land reform became a priority, and
thereafter the Land Reform and Party Consolidation Section of the Chinese
Political Advisory Group (CPAG) assisted in organizing a program of“purifica-
tion” to prepare for land reform by re-educating party members through cam-
paigns of criticism and self-criticism. As Chinese advisors became more involved
in training and supervision, they began to influence the pace and details of
implementing policy. In a document submitted to Vietnamese leaders entitled
“Preliminary Comments on Mass Mobilization in1953,” dated September 3,
1952, Chinese ambassador Luo Guibo outlined a plan for land reform and
asserted that it was time to begin. Shortly after this Ho Chi Minh went to Beijing,
and by October was in Moscow with a land reform plan ostensibly written with
the assistance of Liu Shaoqi (1898–1969), second after Mao Zedong in the
Chinese party hierarchy. Ho Chi Minh presented the plan to Stalin and solicited
his approval.

In early1953, the Vietnamese communists held a conference on mobilizing the
rural population. Truong Chinh personally chaired the committee assigned to
implement land reform. At the same time, dozens of Chinese land reform experts
were sent to join the Land Reform and Party Consolidation Section of CPAG in
Vietnam. From April to August1953, an experimental mass mobilization cam-
paign was conducted in Thai Nguyen and Thanh Hoa. This was designed to
provide training for land reform cadres and to evaluate the response of peasants.
This was followed in September by codifying procedures for mobilizing villagers
to overturn property relations and authority structures.
Cadres were to recruit the poorest villagers and train them to denounce and
confiscate the property of people they identified as their oppressors. Land would
then be redistributed, local government would be reorganized, and the culprits
would be punished. Because of the implications of this for local party leadership,
in November the party issued a directive for evaluating party cells and individual
members based on class background, ideological correctness, competence, and
willingness to follow instructions. In December, the first of several waves of land
reform was begun in Thai Nguyen. The beginning of mass mobilization for
land reform coincided with the mobilization of soldiers and supplies, including
rice from Thanh Hoa, to the battlefield of Dien Bien Phu.
Thereafter, the land reform campaign was extended to all parts of the new
Democratic Republic of Vietnam north of the post-Geneva line at the seventeenth
parallel. However, reports of excessive violence accumulated, and by early1956
war veterans were protesting. By late1956, the party leadership acknowledged
errors and in1957 instituted a rectification campaign to correct injustices. But
many thousands of people had been killed and local party members were in
turmoil. The excessive violence was partly due to the application of a model
designed for rural conditions in China, where class tensions were higher than in
Vietnam. It also partly came from the enthusiasm of Vietnamese cadres in
demonstrating revolutionary fervor to their superiors and fidelity to their Chi-
nese mentors. Large numbers of them were from urban backgrounds, were
unfamiliar with rural life, and relied on their theoretical training when interven-
ing in village society. But more fundamentally the violence was an integral part of
the plan for the party to gain firm control of the rural population, which included
quotas for the number of people to be executed.
The negative reaction to land reform violence began to be a factor in party
affairs in the wake of Nikita Khrushchev’s famous speech at the Moscow party
congress in February1956 attacking Stalin’s cruelty and personality cult. The
Vietnamese delegates to this congress were Truong Chinh and Le Duc Tho
(1911–1990). Le Duc Tho was from an upper-class family in the Nam Dinh
area south of Hanoi. He had been an early member of the Indochinese

Communist Party and had spent much of the1930s and early1940s in prison.
After regaining his freedom in1944, he worked closely with Truong Chinh and
was a leading figure at the Tan Trao conference in August1945. He held
responsibility for internal party operations. From1949 to 1954 he was assigned
to the south where in1951 he helped to organize the party’s Central Office for
the Southern Region (Truong Uong Cuc Mien Nam; generally translated in
English as Central Office for South Vietnam, COSVN). In1954, he returned to
Hanoi and was among the most powerful leaders in the party, nicknamed“the
hammer” for his skill in enforcing discipline.
While he was in the south, Le Duc Tho became an associate of Le Duan (1907–
1986). Le Duan was from a working-class background in Quang Tri Province.
His party career was similar to Le Duc Tho’s, being an early member and
spending many years in prison. After emerging from prison in1945, he obtained
leadership of the party organization in the south, confining Nguyen Binh to
military affairs until Nguyen Binh’s death in 1951. While Le Duc Tho was
educated and relatively cultured, Le Duan had a strong but rather uncouth
personality. The two men nevertheless worked well together and established an
enduring bond. When Le Duc Tho returned north in1954, Le Duan remained as
the senior party leader in the south. Dismayed by the effects of Ngo Dinh Diem’s
“denounce the communists” campaign, in early1956 Le Duan sent a request to
Hanoi to abandon the policy of non-violent struggle in the south and to make
plans for armed resistance. This directly challenged the leadership of Truong
Chinh, who favored Chinese advice to build socialism in the north and to
postpone dealing with the southern question.
When Truong Chinh and Le Duc Tho returned from Moscow to Hanoi in
early 1956, there were three vexing issues facing the party. In addition to land
reform and the southern question was the question of how to respond to
Khrushchev’s speech with its critique of homicidal politics and the cult of
personality. This speech could be locally interpreted as a critique of how the
land reform was conducted and of Ho Chi Minh’s cult of avuncular sainthood.
Protocol required the Vietnamese to acknowledge the Moscow speech. This was
done with a pro forma statement. But the speech simply punctuated a post-Stalin
relaxation of discipline that was affecting many parts of the communist world.
In Poland, violent protests led to a change in government. In Hungary,
replacement of the Stalinist party leader was followed within weeks by an
uprising. In China, Mao Zedong proposed to allow public discussion to identify
problems and strengthen the party, thereby initiating what became known as the
“hundred flowers campaign.” In Vietnam, young intellectuals, most of whom
were party members and veterans of the war with France, wanted to express their
own thoughts and feelings beyond wartime propaganda and political slogans,

and they believed that doing this served both the party and national culture.
A number of literary journals sprang up in1956, the two most influential being
Nhan Van(Humanity) andGiai Pham(Fine Arts). The editor ofNhan Van, and
the doyen of what became known as theNhan Van Giai PhamAffair, was Phan
Khoi, the poet who a quarter-century before had started the New Poetry
Movement.
The contributors to the new journals were emboldened by what seemed to be a
relatively more open attitude toward diversity of thought throughout the com-
munist world and by critical accounts of the land reform that began to surface in
newspapers and party communications. They wrote against dogmatism, hero
worship, and politicized art. They were for the most part not seeking to dissent
from the revolution but rather to enrich it with the benefits of a more tolerant
view of human creativity. The movement nevertheless tarnished Truong Chinh’s
leadership because he had taken the lead to mobilize intellectuals into the party
during the1940s and had posed as the party expert on cultural matters. Now,
the two prime areas in which Truong Chinh had most distinctively exercised his
leadership, land reform and culture, seemed to be slipping out of the party’s
control.
Within a year, important decisions were made about each of the three issues
(land reform, intellectual ferment, and the southern question), but not before
there was a change of leadership. In September1956, Truong Chinh stepped
down as leader of the party and was temporarily replaced by Ho Chi Minh. In
early1957, Le Duan returned to Hanoi to be leader of the party. He and his ally
Le Duc Tho were thereafter the primary decision-makers in Hanoi. Le Duc Tho
kept track of party personnel and ensured that Le Duan was obeyed. Ho Chi
Minh, now most valuable to the party as a symbol of continuity and unity, was
assigned to maintain fraternal relations with the Chinese and Soviet parties.
Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, and Vo Nguyen Giap remained respected
senior colleagues but had weak individual power bases. Leadership of the mili-
tary shifted to Nguyen Chi Thanh (1914–1967), who came from a peasant
background in the Hue area. Like Le Duan, he was not from the educated élite,
as were most of the top party leaders, and he was from the central coast just
south of the seventeenth parallel. He had joined the party in the mid1930s, spent
time in French prisons in the early1940s, had attended the Tan Trao conference,
and by the time of the second party congress in1951 had risen to the rank of
general and was in charge of political commissars in the army. In the late1950s,
he became an ally of Le Duan.
The party knew that it could not afford to either alienate or fail to control the
peasantry. A rectification campaign to ostensibly redress the injustices committed
during the land reform was begun, but not before the most famous episode of

resistance to party authority occurred. This was in Quynh Luu district of Nghe
An, one of the last places reached by the land reform. There, a large Catholic
population had patriotically followed the Viet Minh during the French war but
had been prevented from joining the Catholic exodus to the south in1954. In the
summer of1956, land reform cadres arrived in Quynh Luu. Taking exception to
both the religion and the relative wealth of the population, the cadres were
especially brutal. When members of the International Control Commission,
which had been set up to monitor compliance with the Geneva Accords com-
prised of representatives from Canada, India, and Poland, happened to drive
through Quynh Luu district in November1956, people gathered and appealed to
them for assistance to go to the south. Local authorities were unable to disperse
the demonstrators, and the army was deployed to restore order; there was loss
of life.
Regardless of the“errors” that called for“rectification,” most of which were
beyond recall, the land reform program achieved what it set out to do. It
eliminated anti-revolutionary class enemies in rural society, it instituted an
ostensibly more equitable distribution of land usage, and it traumatized the rural
population into obedience to the state. The latter achievement was particularly
important for the larger agenda of the new Hanoi leadership. The land reform
experience instilled an unquestioning compliance to authority that enabled the
communist party to rely on the sacrifice and suffering of the people again and
again during the next thirty years.
As for the intellectuals involved in theNhan Van Giai PhamAffair, their
journals were shut down, some of them were imprisoned, most of them were sent
to work in factories or the countryside to be re-educated to think like proletar-
ians. As part of the disciplining of the young intellectuals involved in this
movement, the poets who had been at the forefront of the New Poetry Movement
in the1930s, and who had at that time gained fame for expressing their indi-
vidualism, alienation, and romantic imagination, were now mobilized to criticize
the younger generation for wanting to express their personal feelings. Ngo Xuan
Dieu, Cu Huy Can, Luu Trong Lu, The Lu, and Che Lan Vien had all joined the
revolution in the1940s and wrote of their experience as a religious conversion,
turning them away from the prison of their own feelings toward the common life
of the people. They all wrote poems or essays to condemn the selfish, anti-social
attitudes of theNhan Van Giai Phamgeneration and to praise the infallible
leadership of the party.
Cultural policy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam aimed to replace pre-
revolutionary beliefs and practices with new cultic symbols of the state, such as
Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh.
Village festivals were prohibited as superstitious and wasteful. Many temples and

shrines were closed or turned into storehouses. Buddhist monks and Catholic
priests were limited in number and carefully supervised. Traditional music,
typically slow and melancholy, was speeded up to a cheerful marching beat.
The singing ofca truwas suppressed as“feudal.” The proscription of popular
culture was part of the effort to nurture“the new socialist personality.” In art
and literature, heroic themes of peasants and soldiers advancing together into a
bright future were celebrated.
Socialist realism as developed in the Soviet Union and China became the
criteria for literary and artistic expression. A few pre-twentieth-century historical
figures were portrayed as proletarian nationalists, especially the eighteenth-
century Tay Son leader Nguyen Hue Quang Trung, who was celebrated for
coming from an underclass, defeating the oppressive feudal regime, and leading
armies against foreign invaders. But more effort was put into identifying and
promoting the memory of exemplary cultic figures from more recent times, for
example Mac Thi Buoi (1927–1951), a woman from the Hai Duong area with a
reputation for bravery who was captured and killed by the French. In1955, she
was designated as a national hero and commemorated with a mausoleum, a
statue, a shrine, and a postage stamp.
While religions such as Buddhism and Christianity were discouraged,
Confucianism was both denounced as the ideology of the old feudal class and
redefined as a source of redeemable tradition among the common people for
whom it represented not only respect for authority but also a commitment to
social justice and, in its Mencian form, a justification for revolution. Party cadres
discovered that they could easily insert themselves into the space vacated by the
old class of mandarins. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam became a local
version of the type of modern totalitarian state that emerged in the twentieth
century under the banners of fascism and communism.
Start of a new war
The ascendance of Le Duan brought the southern question into the center of
party policy. His request to shift from political to military action in the south was
rejected by the party’s Central Committee when it met in April1956. Instead this
meeting subscribed to the“peaceful coexistence” line of Khrushchev’s speech
and focused on domestic economic problems such as food shortages and the lack
of skilled labor. However, in December1956, after Truong Chinh had stepped
down as party leader, the Central Committee approved a clandestine policy of
gradually rebuilding the party structure in the south and initiating selective
terrorism to kill and kidnap southern government officials and community

leaders. In fact, by this time, Le Duan had already begun to do this. Accordingly,
during1957, there was an upsurge of armed action against the Saigon govern-
ment, a significant part of which was initially conducted by remnants of sect
armies that had been defeated by Ngo Dinh Diem in1955 and had subsequently
allied with the communists.
Le Duan spent1957 and 1958 consolidating his grip on party leadership. In
1957, the launching of a three-year economic plan absorbed the attention of the
party. In November1957, Le Duan went with Ho Chi Minh to a conference of
communist parties in Moscow, gaining first-hand familiarity with the world of
international communism that was vital to the survival of his government. This
came after several uneasy months during which the Soviet Union had proposed
United Nations membership for both the Saigon and Hanoi governments in a
diplomatic gambit aimed at the German situation. During1958, Le Duc Tho
quietly reshuffled personnel in the party hierarchy to advance Le Duan ’s
supporters.
Disturbing news from the south prompted Le Duan to make an inspection trip
in December 1958. Upon his return in January 1959, he reported that the
situation was dire. According to him, the Saigon government had successfully
countered the communist policy approved two years before and was destroying
the party’s organizational infrastructure in the south; two thousand cadres had
been killed during1957–1958, and party membership had plummeted. Faced
with what appeared to be an urgent situation, the Central Committee of the party
approved what came to be known as Resolution Fifteen, which authorized a
policy of war to unify the south with the north.
Although Ho Chi Minh immediately went to Beijing and Moscow for consult-
ations and made two additional trips to those capitals during the course of1959,
there are no indications that either ally was enthusiastic about Hanoi’s new
policy toward Saigon. Mao Zedong was dealing with the disaster of his“great
leap forward,” and Khrushchev was planning a trip to the United States. Never-
theless, Le Duan’s leadership would not have survived failure in the south.
Furthermore, unification had been a cardinal tenet of communist policy since
1954. It could not be abandoned without serious damage to party discipline.
In May 1959, the Central Committee ratified Resolution Fifteen. Within
months, communication and transportation routes into the south by land and
sea were established and thousands of southerners who had regrouped to the
north after Geneva and had since then received training were sent back south.
Hanoi’s war policy gained momentum in the south just as the Sino-Soviet dispute
over leadership of the communist world was breaking into the open. Ho Chi
Minh’s main contribution to the new policy was to maximize its insulation from
this dispute by maintaining good, if sometimes tense, relations with both powers.

The importance of Resolution Fifteen and its implications for the future of the
country prompted the convening of the third national party congress in Septem-
ber1960. The second congress had been held in1951 to mobilize for war with
France after the arrival of Chinese aid. The agenda of this third congress was
related to economic and political aspects of the decision to authorize war in the
south. A five-year industrialization plan was adopted to be the basis for a
wartime economy. Le Duan, who since1957 had been the “acting” leader,
was officially ratified as the head of the party and his followers obtained key
positions. Most immediately significant for policy in the south was adoption of a
plan to create a front organization in the south to emphasize nationalism,
democracy, and prosperity, but without any mention of communism.
The United States at this time appeared passive and vulnerable. After the death
of John Foster Dulles in1959, foreign policy drifted as Eisenhower was in poor
health and the1960 presidential election preoccupied the country. During the
last months of1960, a coup in Laos led to a government in Vientiane that was
sustained by a Soviet airlift from Hanoi, prompting a Cold War crisis that led to
another Geneva conference in1961–1962. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam
took a major role in the Laotian situation to protect its western border and to
ensure that it had access to the western border of the Republic of Vietnam
through southern Laos. An effort to open a supply route directly into the south
through the mountains within Vietnamese borders at the seventeenth parallel
had been defeated in1959 by the southern army.
The 1959 legislative elections in the Republic of Vietnam encouraged public
discussion of government policy in Saigon and relatively open dissent. The
divergence of opinion among Americans in the military and civilian aid programs
gave an impression of confusion and lack of commitment. By late1960, trust
between Ngo Dinh Diem and the American ambassador, Elbridge Durbrow, had
been broken. It was a propitious moment for the communists to mobilize
alienated southerners against the government.
In December 1960, the Communist Party’s Central Office for the Southern
Region (COSVN) established the People’s Liberation Front for South Vietnam
(Mat Tran Dan Toc Giai Phong Mien Nam Viet Nam). This front eventually
included representatives of organizations that aimed to mobilize artists, Bud-
dhists, Catholics, doctors, journalists, minorities, nurses, peasants, students,
teachers, women, workers, writers, youth, and even Americans. It became widely
known in English as the National Liberation Front (NLF). In early1961, the
Southern Region Liberation Army (Quan Giai Phong Mien Nam) was organized
to create a command system for armed units in the south. In English this army
became commonly known as the People’s Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) or as
the Viet Cong, an abbreviation of Viet Nam and“communist” (cong san).

The Hanoi government developed its policy of war in the south at a time when
the Eisenhower administration was losing focus and contradictions among
American officials and between them and Ngo Dinh Diem were becoming
serious. Ngo Dinh Diem endeavored to defeat the threat from the north while
resisting American pressure to force him into a position of subordination that he
believed would ruin his nationalist credentials. But the drumbeat of American
criticism directed at Ngo Dinh Diem’s government aroused expectations of
opportunities among aspiring politicians in Saigon who were dissatisfied with
how Ngo Dinh Nhu had controlled the National Assembly elections held in
August1959.
Ngo Dinh Diem between communists and Americans
The contradiction between French colonialism and American promotion of an
independent, sovereign Vietnamese state had been a prominent aspect of US
involvement in Vietnamese affairs in the late1940s and early1950s. In the late
1950s, although the French were no longer part of the situation, an analogous
contradiction between controlling the policies of a client regime and respecting
the sovereignty of an allied government became embedded in the US bureaucratic
structure that grew up around the American commitment to defend a non-
communist South Vietnam. This contradiction became increasingly volatile as
the Hanoi decision to initiate war in the south gathered momentum and Saigon’s
dependence upon US assistance accordingly increased.
Ambassador Durbrow and others believed that the upsurge of insurrection
produced by implementation of Hanoi’s Resolution Fifteen in1959 was primar-
ily a political and not a military problem, and that the correct solution was for
Ngo Dinh Diem to share power with his critics. This point of view began to
appear in US press reports, which from a Vietnamese perspective were under-
stood to represent official US policy. Durbrow’s idea of“linking” US support for
the Republic of Vietnam to liberalizing reforms became well known among Ngo
Dinh Diem’s Saigon critics and emboldened eighteen of them to sign a public
manifesto in May1960 that echoed American criticisms of Ngo Dinh Diem’s
government. This“Manifesto of the Eighteen” became popularly known as the
Caravelle Manifesto after the name of the hotel in downtown Saigon where the
group met.
The eighteen men who signed the Caravelle Manifesto included two who had
served as provincial governors under the French, five who had served in pre-
1954Bao Dai cabinets, six who had briefly served in Ngo Dinh Diem’s first
cabinet in 1954, two professors, one elderly graduate of the1903 doctoral

examination, a Catholic priest, and a medical doctor (six of the others were also
medical doctors). Their manifesto was addressed to Ngo Dinh Diem and
reflected criticisms of his government that had begun to appear in both American
and Vietnamese newspapers, such as charges of corruption, nepotism, and
promotions in both the civil administration and the army that were based on
personal loyalty rather than competence; the manifesto also asserted that the
south could compete successfully with the north only by embracing liberal
democracy and civil rights. The manifesto charged that the Ngo Dinh family
had manipulated the legislative elections of the previous year to exclude those
who were not members of its entourage and that the election was spoiled by
censorship and politically motivated arrests. It lamented unemployment, poverty,
and the lack of economic activity. It claimed that the elimination of sect armies
simply left the countryside vulnerable to the communists and that the govern-
ment’s agrarian policy, which was then focused upon the building of rural towns
called agrovilles, was provoking disaffection and giving ammunition to enemy
propaganda.
There was substance to these complaints, particularly with how the agroville
scheme had been implemented and how the legislative elections had been con-
ducted during1959. In both cases, the Ngo Dinh brothers had responded to the
upsurge of communist-led insurgency by resorting to severe measures that alien-
ated as well as mobilized. When they saw this, however, they endeavored to
modify their policies. They abandoned the agroville plan in1960 and subse-
quently loosened their control over electoral political activity. On the other hand,
they sought to minimize American involvement in what they viewed as internal
Vietnamese affairs. Meanwhile, their Vietnamese critics were beginning to think
that they could legitimize a role for themselves in the Saigon government by
championing American demands for political reform. The contradiction in US
policy had expanded into Saigon’s domestic politics.
The agroville concept had been hastily developed in early1959 as part of a
response to the rising communist challenge in the countryside. The idea was to
concentrate the rural population into new towns where it could enjoy the benefits
of urban life with schools, hospitals, stronger community organizations, and
physical security. The people were expected to volunteer their labor to create
the agrovilles and thereby gain a sense of self-sufficiency and develop a spirit of
public service. American involvement was excluded to preclude the intrusion of
foreign ideas and money that would simply induce an attitude of dependency
upon the US. The Ngo Dinh brothers were influenced by their personalist
ideology about modernizing through self-reliance and collective advance. They
were also determined to keep American hands from reaching too deeply into
Vietnamese society.

Within a year, however, the agroville experiment was discredited by the
coercive practices of local officials seeking to meet unrealistic deadlines, the
reluctance of rural people to relocate and to donate their labor for a project they
did not understand, and by the success of communist agents in sabotaging and
denouncing the policy. Around twenty agrovilles had been started when the
scheme was discontinued in mid1960. Not only had the agrovilles aroused
internal opposition, but they also provided a new target for American criticism
of Ngo Dinh Diem’s government. By the autumn of 1960, Ambassador
Durbrow’s demands for reform were being expressed with greater urgency as
warfare in the countryside intensified. At the same time, Ngo Dinh Diem lost his
strongest ally among the Americans when General Lionel Charles McGarr
(1904–1988) replaced Samuel Williams as the MAAG commander in the
summer of 1960. McGarr’s appointment was made in response to the upsurge
of rural insurgency. He had been associated with studies of counterinsurgency,
and he gave more attention to the details of small-unit action than Williams had
been inclined to do.
Meanwhile, Durbrow’s pressure for change increased. In October1960,h e
conveyed to Ngo Dinh Diem a list of suggested reforms that included reorganiza-
tion of the cabinet, restricting the Ngo Dinh patronage system, increasing the
powers of the legislature, relaxing press censorship, raising the price of rice, and
providing subsidies to people mobilized for community service. He also urged
that Ngo Dinh Nhu be excluded from the government. Ngo Dinh Nhu was
especially disliked by Ngo Dinh Diem’s critics, both Vietnamese and American,
because of his effectiveness in maintaining the security of the regime and his
resistance to proffered American tutelage.
Durbrow’s threat of “linkage” between Ngo Dinh Diem’s compliance and
continued US support was not a secret. The resonance of Durbrow’s agenda with
the Caravelle Manifesto of five months before was apparent to politically alert
Vietnamese. Some disgruntled and adventurous Vietnamese imagined that the
Americans were prepared to countenance a change of government, as had
occurred in South Korea when Syngman Rhee was pushed out of power the
previous spring. Criticism of the Saigon government in the American press and
Durbrow’s advocacy of political reform encouraged some of Ngo Dinh Diem’s
critics to imagine that the Americans would welcome his overthrow.
Three days after the election of a new American president in November1960,
some army units led by officers resentful about what they perceived as discrimin-
ation in promotions attempted a coup to unseat Ngo Dinh Diem. They were
joined by some civilian political figures, including Phan Quang Dan, the most
outspoken critic of Ngo Dinh Diem in the late1950s, whose election to the
legislature in 1959 had been annulled. Others who adhered to the coup were

people associated with the Caravelle Manifesto and with political groups that
had been sidelined by Ngo Dinh Diem, such as the Vietnamese Nationalist Party,
the Dai Viet Party, the Hoa Hao, and the Cao Dai.
While the outcome of the coup hung in the balance, Durbrow struck a pose of
neutrality and urged Ngo Dinh Diem to compromise with the coup leaders. This
thoroughly alienated Ngo Dinh Diem from Durbrow and was the end of Dur-
brow’s effectiveness as ambassador. It also aroused the specter of Syngman
Rhee’s overthrow, and Ngo Dinh Diem’s sense of trust in the US was irreparably
damaged.
The coup collapsed when army units loyal to Ngo Dinh Diem converged on
Saigon. Military leaders of the coup escaped to Cambodia where they obtained
asylum. Phan Quang Dan and several signers of the Caravelle Manifesto were
arrested. This episode demonstrated the extent to which critics of the government
were sensitive to indications of deteriorating American support for Ngo Dinh
Diem, and its timing caught the attention of the newly elected American
President.
The Kennedy escalation
At the end of1960, American policy in Southeast Asia was in disarray with the
Laotian situation threatening a Cold War confrontation and relations with
Saigon in turmoil. During the next year, the administration of John Fitzgerald
Kennedy developed new policies toward Laos and Vietnam that became the basis
of subsequent US involvement in the region. An influential figure in formulating
and implementing these policies was William Averell Harriman (1891–1986), a
prominent businessman who had served as ambassador to London and to
Moscow, as Secretary of Commerce in Harry Truman’s cabinet, and as Gov-
ernor of New York State. Kennedy successively appointed him Ambassador at
Large (January1961), Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs
(November 1961), and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (April1963).
As an elder statesman with extensive diplomatic experience and as a senior
member of the President’s political party, Harriman enjoyed Kennedy’s confi-
dence. Participation in wartime and post-war diplomacy during the Roosevelt
and Truman administrations had inclined Harriman to believe that local conun-
drums could be sorted out by understandings reached among the major powers,
who would in turn police their respective small-power clients. This perspective
led to an international agreement to neutralize Laos and to the policy goal of
unseating Ngo Dinh Diem for insufficient compliance with American instruc-
tions. Harriman strongly disliked Ngo Dinh Diem because of his resistance to

American supervision and his opposition to Harriman’s effort to neutralize Laos.
Ngo Dinh Diem saw that the Laos agreement in effect ceded to Hanoi control of
South Vietnam’s border with Laos, but Harriman trusted Moscow to keep Hanoi
in line and viewed Ngo Dinh Diem as a recalcitrant beneficiary of American Cold
War leadership. A group of men highly critical of Ngo Dinh Diem gathered
around Harriman in the State Department.
At the same time, a different perspective developed in the Department of
Defense under Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara (1916–2009), a
systems analyst with wartime experience in the1940s as a logistics expert and
with post-war experience in the automobile industry. He excelled at organizing
available resources to attain assigned goals and was less concerned with formu-
lating policy than with using quantitative methods of evaluation to guide policy
implementation to get results. Another important figure in Kennedy’s Depart-
ment of Defense was General Maxwell Davenport Taylor (1901–1987), a man
with a distinguished wartime record who, as Army Chief of Staff in the late
1950s, dissented from Eisenhower’s defense policy of “massive retaliation,”
which threatened use of nuclear weapons and minimized the role of the army.
Taylor resigned and, in1960, published a book that argued the need for an army
able to deal with situations short of nuclear war with a policy of“flexible
response” to military threats. Kennedy was impressed with this book and made
Taylor his military advisor. In October1962, Kennedy appointed Taylor to be
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. McNamara and Taylor favored maximiz-
ing military assistance to Ngo Dinh Diem to deal with the security problem
rather than encouraging his critics with demands for political reform.
Kennedy replaced Durbrow with Frederick Ernst Nolting (1911–1989), a
former naval officer and career diplomat. Nolting arrived in spring1961, just
as Ngo Dinh Diem conducted a presidential election that he overwhelmingly won
against two virtually unknown candidates. Nolting established a good relation-
ship with the Ngo Dinh brothers, but they never fully trusted the US again.
Nolting exercised his diplomatic skills in dealing both with the Ngo Dinh
brothers and with his superiors in Washington, DC. He succeeded in minimizing
US demands while eliciting small indications of Vietnamese cooperation, thereby
restoring a façade of American respect for Vietnamese sovereignty and of Viet-
namese compliance with American expectations.
However, during 1961, the Americans and the Vietnamese developed diver-
gent policies toward the communist threat, not only with little prior consultation
but also with the aim of avoiding the need for consultation altogether. By the end
of the year, both Ngo Dinh Diem and Kennedy were pushing forward new
counterinsurgency policies; but, while the Vietnamese sought to minimize
dependence upon American assistance, the Americans sought to mask the scale

of their escalating military presence in Vietnam from both the American public
and the Vietnamese government.
Furthermore, the Ngo Dinh brothers understood that the communist supply
lines through Laos into South Vietnam could not be stopped by an international
agreement; they saw Kennedy’s decision to support Harriman’s policy on Laos as
at best a miscalculation and at worst an indication that the US would eventually
abandon them as it seemed to have abandoned the anti-communist Laotians.
Nevertheless, while pursuing different paths, the Vietnamese and Americans
implemented policies that by1962 were showing signs of success against the
Hanoi-supported insurgency.
After ending the failed agroville experiment in1960, the Ngo Dinh brothers
put their authority behind a new plan to build strategic hamlets. The strategic
hamlet idea emerged by mid1961 from local initiatives in Tay Ninh, Quang
Ngai, and Vinh Long Provinces. It was elaborated by Ngo Dinh Nhu’s person-
alist philosophy of modernizing rural communities by fostering collective effort
and self-reliance. It aimed to bring revolutionary change to the countryside by
fostering an attitude of“struggle” for a better life with a new generation of
leaders unspoiled by the corruption and passivity associated with habits
remaining from the French colonial experience. The idea of strategic hamlets
was to minimize relocating people as much as possible and to reorganize com-
munities for self-defense, self-government, a more egalitarian society, and a more
dynamic economy.
The personalism of the Ngo Dinh brothers was a relatively abstract and
idealized formulation, but no more vague and incomprehensible to Vietnamese
peasants than was Marxism-Leninism. The critical factors in comparing the two
Vietnams at this time are that the Ngo Dinh regime, unlike the rulers in Hanoi,
did not have the benefit of a disciplined one-party totalitarian state to enforce its
version of modernism and that it was challenged at every turn by an active and
externally directed enemy. In the Vietnams of that time, both north and south,
the effective exercise of power was the first step to obtain popular obedience or,
at least, compliance. In the north, this was achieved with the land reform and the
disciplining of intellectuals during the1950s. In the south, Ngo Dinh Diem strove
to modernize rural society while at the same time protecting it from an externally
directed and supplied enemy. The strategic hamlet program was his final experi-
ment for achieving this goal.
An important role in implementing strategic hamlets was assigned to the
Republican Youth Movement, which had been organized in1960 to mobilize
young people to be activists in moving the country out of the colonial mentality
that remained strong among the older generation. Within two years, over a
million and a half young people were trained and assigned to participate in the

strategic hamlet program. Their task was to revolutionize rural communities by
propagating an attitude of self-reliance and by helping to prepare and organize
elections for local leaders, thereby releasing latent talent and energy inhibited by
the existing structure of authority. In the larger scheme of Ngo Dinh Nhu’s
thought, this would ideally be the beginning of a self-generating form of Viet-
namese democracy that, spreading from the countryside, would eventually over-
come the poisonous residue of French colonialism that was still strong among
urban intellectuals.
Strategic hamlets were designed not only as a response to the communist
insurgency but also as a response to the threat of American interference in
Vietnamese domestic affairs, for the Ngo Dinh brothers feared that American
largess and instruction would destroy the self-reliance and national pride that
they understood to be the key to building up a social and administrative structure
that could withstand the challenge from the north. As the Americans gradually
became aware of the program and saw the merit of it, they instinctively wanted
to support it with their resources and expertise, and to the extent that this was
done without compromising Vietnamese aims and authority it was welcomed.
But Americans quickly developed ideas about how the program should be
conceptualized and implemented as an extension of their aid and advisory
mission, and these ideas diverged from the aims of the Vietnamese government.
The Ngo Dinh brothers pressed for urgent speed in implementing the program,
seeing it as a way to foster local initiative, on which they wished to rely rather
than waiting for American money and supervision. There were around five
hundred strategic hamlets by the end of1961. By the end of1962, the number
was up to four thousand. Americans got involved by providing material
resources and advisory assistance in certain areas, but they were dismayed by
what they saw as undue haste and lack of systematic planning. While the Ngo
Dinh brothers were counting on a release of energy among the people to gain
sufficient momentum to overcome obstacles, American critics could not see
beyond the apparent confusion and friction produced by this effort to revolution-
ize rural society. Americans viewed the pace of implementation as unrealistic and
argued that the program should be slowed down to consolidate success in one
place before extending the process to adjacent localities. On the other hand, the
Ngo Dinh brothers believed that a rapid pace of implementation was necessary
to preclude being overwhelmed by the insurgency.
A more serious aspect of the pace of implementation is that, in their haste to
meet assigned deadlines, provincial authorities sometimes resorted to coercion
and intimidation. This compromised the revolutionary goal of nurturing a Viet-
namese version of grass-roots democracy espoused by the Republican Youth
Movement. It also provided fuel for communist propaganda, which denounced

the program as a form of exploitation and oppression. The great outcry of
communist propaganda, however, came not simply from whatever popular
resentment the program produced in some places. It was more directly an
indication that the program, however poorly implemented, created serious prob-
lems for the insurgency by disrupting its links to the rural population. In1962,
the insurgency suffered serious setbacks and appeared to lose the initiative that it
seemed to have had in1961. South Vietnamese and American authorities were
tempted to think that the strategic hamlet program might be the answer to turn
back communist influence in the countryside.
While the strategic hamlet program was the central focus of the Ngo Dinh
brothers, it was but a minor aspect of what the Americans were doing in1962.I n
late 1961, Kennedy decided to increase by many thousands the number of US
military advisors, to send bombers and helicopters, and to delegate direct super-
vision of this escalating American presence in Vietnam to Robert McNamara.
Kennedy temporarily shelved criticism of Ngo Dinh Diem in favor of a major
escalation in training, advising, and providing support to the Vietnamese army.
In early1962, a new command system was established for the US army in
Vietnam. The MAAG was absorbed into the Military Assistance Command,
Vietnam (MACV) under General Paul Donald Harkins (1904–1984). During
the next two and a half years, Harkins presided over a steady increase of US
military personnel from less than one thousand to over sixteen thousand.
Characteristically, this new American policy was decided with a minimum of
consultation with the Vietnamese government. Within months, the thousands of
Americans entering the country“without passports” were a source of dismay to
Ngo Dinh Diem, who began to worry that the sovereignty of his country was
being compromised. While grateful for American assistance, he did not trust
American advisors to resist the temptation to take command of military and civil
operations, thereby pushing aside his government. While the combination of the
strategic hamlet program and the American military escalation dealt the com-
munist insurgents major setbacks, it also exacerbated the tensions between the
US and the Republic of Vietnam.
With the dramatic increase of American advisors came greater scrutiny from
the American press. The official position of the Kennedy administration was that
Americans were advising the Vietnamese army but were not directly involved in
combat. American news reporters soon learned otherwise, and a pattern of
dissimulation by Harkins and of skepticism by American reporters created sharp
tension in MACV news briefings. Even more ominous for the US–Vietnamese
relationship was the clash of cultural values produced by many thousands of
American advisors with limited or no Vietnamese language ability attempting to
work with their Vietnamese counterparts. The result was a critical mass of

frustrated American advisors who did not understand Vietnamese culture and
were alienated by what they imagined that they had learned about it.
A“frustrated advisor” syndrome was combined with a“critical reporter” syn-
drome, and the two groups of young Americans, soldiers and reporters, shared
information and opinions that were reflected in the American press as charges of
corruption and incompetence against Ngo Dinh Diem’s government. American
reporters were given freedom to gather information and to file reports without
any limitations, which soon became a factor in internal Vietnamese politics as
their reports critical of the Vietnamese government were recycled back into the
Vietnamese press and widely understood as representative of official US govern-
ment views. In fact, Kennedy was particularly solicitous of the press, and press
reports came to play a prominent role in how he understood events in Vietnam
and in how he responded to those events.
Seeing this, Ngo Dinh Diem felt increasingly cornered and diminished by an
overwhelming American presence that threatened to deprive him of legitimacy
among Vietnamese nationalists. He was also concerned that the host of Ameri-
can advisors was instilling a colonial mentality in the new generation of Viet-
namese officers. But, as long as the counterinsurgency efforts appeared to bear
fruit, he chose to trust Nolting’s assurances that the situation was temporary and
that the number of American advisors would be reduced as soon as possible. He
was also comforted by the hope that success of the strategic hamlet program
would eventually make such intensive American involvement in his country
unnecessary.
The Kennedy escalation produced a dramatic growth in the American military
and civilian bureaucracy in Vietnam. This upsurge of activity was initially funded
by purchase of local currency with dollars, but after a year these funds were
expended, and the US wanted the Vietnamese government to contribute directly
to a“counterinsurgency fund” that was under American control. Ngo Dinh
Diem resisted this as a loss of authority over his national budget and a dimin-
ution of Vietnamese sovereignty. In the spring of1963, after weeks of negoti-
ations, Nolting eventually arranged a compromise acceptable to both sides.
Assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem
The Vietnamese–American relationship unraveled in1963 as a result of several
factors. The flawed Laotian agreement of1962 facilitated North Vietnamese use
of southern Laos to supply communist forces in South Vietnam. This assisted
Hanoi’s response to the challenge of strategic hamlets and of escalating American
advisory, logistical, and air support activities. Harriman, the chief architect of the

Laos agreement, bitterly resented Ngo Dinh Diem’s criticism of it. Harriman was
the most influential among a group of officials in the State Department and the
National Security Council that pressed for Ngo Dinh Diem’s removal from
power. These officials were emboldened when he began to appear increasingly
vulnerable during the course of1963. This vulnerability developed from at least
five sources: French foreign policy, which aimed to extend to South Vietnam the
neutralization scheme that had been imposed on Laos; disenchanted erstwhile
American supporters; the response of American public opinion to critical news
reports from Saigon; a movement to overthrow him led by Buddhist monks; and
military officers susceptible to signs of American encouragement for them to
organize a coup.
President de Gaulle imagined a role for France in Southeast Asia as the patron
of neutral countries who desired to avoid the bipolar Cold War alternatives.
Norodom Sihanouk (1922–2012), the leader of Cambodia, was an enthusiastic
supporter of this, and the Laotian agreement of1962 appeared to offer an
example of power sharing between communists and non-communists. The
Hanoi government professed to see benefit in this French initiative. In the south,
some Vietnamese saw it as a way to avoid war and to reverse the tide of
American advisors. Officially, the Saigon government and the US considered
neutralism as simply a step toward surrender. However, as the Ngo Dinh
brothers became increasingly alienated from the Americans during1963, this
path out of the American shadow acquired some plausibility, and rumors of
contact between the two Vietnamese governments added to the rising tension
between Saigon and Washington, DC.
In 1961, some American academics who had participated in an aid and advis-
ory program in Vietnam sponsored by Michigan State University published
articles denouncing Ngo Dinh Diem as a dictator. With the dramatic escalation
of American assistance to Saigon during1962, a dissenting view that American
aid was being wasted on behalf of an unworthy tyrant gained traction among
some American intellectuals. The most influential of these critics was Michael
Joseph Mansfield (1903–2001), a former Professor of Latin American and Far
Eastern History who in 1961 became the majority leader of the US Senate.
Mansfield was a senior member of Kennedy’s political party who, like Kennedy,
had voiced strong support for Ngo Dinh Diem in the1950s. However, after a
visit to Saigon in late 1962, he advised Kennedy that Ngo Dinh Diem was
unworthy of continued American assistance. Mansfield was widely respected
for his expertise on Asia and for his thoughtful, considered manner. The official
report of his trip to Vietnam was published in February1963. It asserted that
continued support of the Saigon government was a waste, and it recommended
that the US should withdraw from the Vietnamese situation. The Mansfield

report raised doubts about Vietnamese policy in the minds of some American
politicians and officials, and it damaged Ngo Dinh Diem’s confidence in the
future of Vietnamese–American relations.
Meanwhile, a group of young American reporters had become advocates of
overthrowing the Ngo Dinh brothers. In January1963, a small battle in which
communist forces inflicted disproportionate damage on South Vietnamese forces
was reported from the vantage of an American advisor who had participated in
the battle and who blamed its outcome on the corruption and incompetence of
the Vietnamese government. This battle, which the Americans called the Battle of
Ap Bac, was not representative of military activity in the country at that time, but
it was reported in American newspapers as a major defeat for Saigon, a turning
point in favor of the communists, and an indictment of Vietnamese leadership.
Reports of this event in the US cast doubt on the efficacy of American efforts in
Vietnam so long as the Ngo Dinh brothers remained in power.
Despite the negativity generated against the Ngo Dinh brothers in the American
press and among American officials, Kennedy remained confident in McNamara’s
positive evaluation of progress on the battlefield and in the importance ofNgo Dinh
Diem for maintaining political stability in Saigon. This changed with theeruption of
the Buddhist movement in the summer of1963. Although the Ngo Dinh brothers
had successfully asserted their ascendancy over the religious sects in the Mekong
River plain and over rival urban-based political parties such as the Nationalists and
the Dai Viet, and although they had shown an ability to compete with communists
for control of the rural population, they were relatively oblivious to the vulnerability
created by their adherence to Roman Catholicism, and particularly to how this
vulnerability was exacerbated by Ngo Dinh Thuc (1897–1984), the eldest living
brother who, after serving more than twenty years as a bishop at Vinh Long in the
Mekong plain, had been appointed Archbishop of Hue in late1960.
The great infusion of Catholic refugees from northern Vietnam in1954, added
to southern Catholics, was a ready source of support for the Ngo Dinh brothers,
who tended to rely upon Catholics not only because of their relatively high level
of education, economic prowess, and community discipline, but also because of
the role of the Church in recommending and guaranteeing the behavior of loyal
people. Catholic refugees contributed to the larger tension between northerners
and southerners, between immigrants benefiting from government assistance and
local inhabitants struggling for a livelihood. But beyond this, many southerners
converted to Catholicism as a step closer to the center of power, and advantages
gained thereby were resented and viewed as discriminatory by those who chose
not to take that path.
Ngo Dinh Diem had no discernible intention to discriminate against non-
Catholics, and he labored to establish good relations with the Buddhist

monkhood. He subsidized the building and repair of Buddhist temples and
guaranteed freedom of religion. Yet, the undercurrent of incipient favoritism
toward Catholics remained. This may never have broken into the open as it
did in1963 without the destabilizing activities of Ngo Dinh Thuc as Archbishop
of Hue, for Hue also happened to be the center of a Buddhist leadership disposed
to challenge Ngo Dinh Diem on both religious and political grounds.
Ever since the“Buddhist revival” led by Vien Chieu in the1920s and1930s,
there was a strong tendency toward radical political activism among some
Buddhist monks with nationalist inclinations. By the1940s, Vien Chieu and
others had gone so far as to leave the monkhood and to join the Indochinese
Communist Party. In the early1950s, many young Vietnamese circulated
between the monkhood and the Viet Minh struggle against French colonialism.
After1954, some monks continued to maintain contact with one another across
the demilitarized zone. In the early1960s, many monks supported the idea of
neutralism as a way to avoid civil war. In their opinion, the Ngo Dinh regime
discriminated against Buddhists in favor of Catholics and had furthermore
opened the country to American domination and civil war. The Kennedy admin-
istration’s military escalation produced a sense of urgency among monks to stop
the slide into a war.
Young Vietnamese monks were encouraged to take an active part in public
affairs by the larger movement of Asian Buddhists that had arisen in the1950s
from nationalist struggles against colonialism and in reaction to the Cold War
clash of non-Asian ideologies. This was in contrast to older, more conservative,
monks who tended to be based in rural areas and who preferred to avoid the
vicissitudes of politics. Hue was a former royal capital and colonial cultural
center. Monks there tended to be politically alert with a sense of responsibility for
the country.
Until the appointment of Ngo Dinh Thuc as Archbishop of Hue, Ngo Dinh
Can (1911–1964), a younger Ngo Dinh brother, had effectively governed the
northern part of South Vietnam and maintained good relations with the local
Buddhist monks, including Thich Tri Quang (b.1924), a leader among the
younger, more politically inclined monks based at Hue. However, Ngo Dinh
Thuc overshadowed his younger brother and destabilized the situation by mixing
his efforts to promote Catholicism with his influence over government adminis-
tration. He demonstrated a high-profile arrogance and insensitivity toward non-
Catholics that alienated many Buddhists from the Saigon government. Buddhist
leaders accused him of aggressive proselytizing with the weight of the govern-
ment behind him. Ngo Dinh Diem could not bring himself to acknowledge that
his elder brother, to whom he had given respect and deference throughout his
life, was creating a problem.

In early May1963, uproar broke out in Hue over the discriminatory enforce-
ment of regulations about the flying of religious flags. The twenty-fifth anniver-
sary observance of Ngo Dinh Thuc’s ordination as a bishop had flourished
Catholic flags, but shortly after this some local officials tried to prevent the flying
of Buddhist flags during the observance of Vesakha, commonly referred to in
English as Vesak or“the Buddha’s birthday.” Vesak was a relatively new
Buddhist holiday that had been established in1950 at the inaugural conference
of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Colombo, Sri Lanka, which thereafter
encouraged the promotion of Buddhism in national cultures.
Thich Tri Quang had studied in Sri Lanka and became active in the Vietnam
General Buddhist Association that was founded in1951 by monks who were
inspired by the Colombo meeting. After1954, this organization was abolished in
North Vietnam when the communist authorities implemented a policy to control
and discourage religion, but it continued to exist in South Vietnam, based at
Hue, where by1963 Thich Tri Quang had become one of its leaders. A French
colonial law that permitted the term“church” to be used only by Catholics had
produced the term“association” in the organization’s name. That this law had
never been revoked is an indication of Ngo Dinh Diem’s lack of awareness or
concern about the resentment it produced and about the danger of allowing his
elder brother to flaunt Catholicism in the region most committed to a Buddhist
version of nationalism.
Thich Tri Quang was prominent in organizing the1963 Vesak observance as a
response to Ngo Dinh Thuc’s activities. He was determined to use the occasion to
rally public resentment against the archbishop and against the official policy of
discrimination that the archbishop seemed to promote. Although government
officials quickly disowned and reversed the effort to prevent display of Buddhist
flags, Thich Tri Quang and his followers aroused a campaign of protest against
religious discrimination of which the flag controversy was symbolic. Thich Tri
Quang led a demonstration to the Hue radio station with the intention of
broadcasting his complaints against the government. After soldiers arrived on
the scene, explosions killed several demonstrators.
According to various theories, the soldiers, or the communists, or even the
Americans had set off the explosions, but evidence for assigning culpability
remains inconclusive and controversial. Nevertheless, Thich Tri Quang took
the most plausible and expedient line of blaming the government, which was
widely believed. He presented the government with five demands: freedom to fly
Buddhist flags, revocation of the law forbidding Buddhist organizations the legal
status of a“church,” indemnification for the families of those who died at the
radio station, punishment of those responsible for the deaths, and the end of all
discrimination against Buddhists.

Ngo Dinh Diem was slow to respond to these demands. He was reluctant to
acknowledge any official policy of religious discrimination, and he blamed the
radio station deaths on the communists. He preferred to deal with older, less
radical monks, but did not arrive at an agreement with them until mid June, by
which time Thich Tri Quang and his activist followers had expanded their anti-
government activities to Saigon and staged the public immolation of a monk to
protest what was reported in the American press as“religious persecution.” This
event provoked widespread outrage against Ngo Dinh Diem’s government in the
US and turned the Kennedy administration against him.
Kennedy replaced Nolting with Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. (1902–1985), a
former senator, ambassador to the UN, and candidate for vice president who
came from a social background similar to Kennedy and Harriman and who
shared Harriman’s disdain for uncooperative leaders of client states. By the time
Lodge arrived in Saigon in August, the Vietnamese government had ended a
summer of Buddhist street demonstrations by declaring martial law, seizing
temples, and removing activist monks to prison or to the custody of senior
monks in rural areas. Thich Tri Quang took refuge in the US embassy where
Lodge treated him as an honored guest and where he acknowledged that his aim
was to bring down the government.
Buddhists and foreign newsmen charged that the suppression of the Buddhist
movement during the raids on temples had been excessively violent and that
many people had been killed. Ngo Dinh Diem subsequently requested and
obtained a UN“fact-finding team” that arrived in October and was permitted
to investigate without restrictions. The UN report, made public after Ngo Dinh
Diem’s downfall, claimed that there had been no deaths and that those
imprisoned had all been released.
Meanwhile, Ngo Dinh Diem held elections for the National Assembly that had
been scheduled at the end of August but were postponed due to the imposition of
martial law. Martial law was lifted in mid September and the election was held at
the end of the month. This was the most open and least manipulated national
election held under Ngo Dinh Diem. The number of elected members affiliated
with the National Revolutionary Movement that served as the front organization
for the Ngo Dinh brothers fell from seventy-six to fifty-five while those unaffili-
ated with the regime increased from thirty-six to sixty-six. Ngo Dinh Diem
accepted the election results and opened the new, albeit relatively powerless,
legislature shortly before his death. By this time, US policymakers were no longer
interested in electoral reform, having already decided the fate of Ngo Dinh
Diem’s regime.
In late August, Lodge endeavored to promote a military coup against Ngo
Dinh Diem in response to instructions from the State Department drafted by

Harriman and his collaborators, which Kennedy subsequently approved. The
senior generals on whom the Americans began to place their hopes had begun
their careers with the French army; some had been French citizens. The leading
figure among them was Duong Van Minh (1916–2001), the son of a wealthy
Cochinchina landowner whom Ngo Dinh Diem had retired from active service.
The catalyst for the flurry of plotting in late August was the arrival of Lodge and
his clandestine contacts with disgruntled officers. On the other hand, Harkins
made no secret of his lack of enthusiasm for a coup, which, along with a lack of
mutual trust among the generals, initially stymied efforts to organize a
conspiracy.
In July, at the peak of the Buddhist demonstrations, Ngo Dinh Diem staged
trials of civilians who had been arrested in connection with the coup attempt of
November1960, and other former political figures were summoned for ques-
tioning as well. This was a warning to aspiring politicians tempted to support
Thich Tri Quang’s call for a change of government. Ngo Dinh Diem had
excluded from his government people associated with the Nationalist and Dai
Viet Parties, ostensibly because of their past status as clients of China and Japan
and their participation in Bao Dai’s governments in the early1950s. They also
represented rival networks of men with political and administrative experience.
In February1962, two air force pilots had bombed the presidential mansion; one
of them was the son of a Nationalist Party leader who had been briefly jailed in
1960. The plotting military officers had no ability to govern, but there were
many doctors, lawyers, former administrators, and other professional people
who were alienated from the Ngo Dinh regime and were ready to serve if given
an opportunity.
During September and October 1963, Kennedy leaned toward the State
Department view of Ngo Dinh Diem and waited on Lodge’s efforts to encourage
the generals to seize the government. The plotters asked that the Commodity
Import Program be suspended as a signal that the US government fully supported
them; this was done in mid October. After a final face-to-face meeting between
Lodge and one of the generals to convey assurance that the US approved the
conspiracy, Ngo Dinh Diem and Ngo Dinh Nhu were seized and killed at the
beginning of November. Ngo Dinh Thuc was out of the country at the time and
never returned. Ngo Dinh Can was killed six months later. The overthrow of
Ngo Dinh Diem was Kennedy’s most fateful achievement in Vietnam. It funda-
mentally changed the Vietnamese–American relationship and set US involvement
in Vietnam in a new direction.
Ngo Dinh Diem had stabilized a government in South Vietnam that resisted
Hanoi’s efforts to destroy it by means of political agitation, terrorism, and
insurgency. His strength lay in the desire of various groups to maintain a non-

communist option for the future of the country, in his reputation as a nationalist,
and in his ability to elicit American aid. However, when Hanoi resorted to military
means to overthrow his government in1959, each of these strengths became a
weakness. His strict attitude toward national sovereignty, a vestige of his disgust
with French colonialism, also extended toward critics and potential allies, and he
withdrew into the inner circle of his family and personal entourage. The widespread
desire for an effective anti-communist leader had benefited him in the mid 1950s,
but he alienated many public-spirited people who were disappointed at being denied
an opportunity to contribute to national affairs. His blindness to theseriousness of
his elder brother stirring up religious resentment in the northern part of the country
made him vulnerable to both his Vietnamese and his American critics. Increasingly
concerned about the double threat of communist insurgency and American intru-
sion, he allowed the monk-led demonstrations against his government to continue
for nearly four months, undermining his control of the military and his relationship
with the United States. American support became the poison he feared; it over-
whelmed and finally discarded him. Without American encouragement, the army
generals would never have moved against him. The generals were united not so
much against Ngo Dinh Diem as by the opportunity offered by the Americans.
Political turmoil in Saigon
Despite filling the role of“first among equals” during the planning and execution
of the coup, Duong Van Minh was indolent and without ideas aside from
removing Ngo Dinh Diem’s officials and abandoning his policies. In a matter
of days, the structure of authority created by the Ngo Dinh brothers was
dismantled and the strategic hamlet program came to a halt. During the three
months of Duong Van Minh’s regime, most government activity had to do with
sorting out a shifting pecking order among military officers and allotting the
spoils of power. Duong Van Minh was susceptible to the views of the Buddhist
activists, and to the extent that a general policy for his government could be
discerned, his rivals and the increasingly appalled Americans accused him of
favoring the neutralism touted by the French and by Sihanouk. Sihanouk ended
his relationship with American foreign aid after Ngo Dinh Diem’s death, fearing
that it could have a similar effect in Cambodia, and he called for a neutralization
of Indochina. Duong Van Minh resisted extension of the US advisory program
and appeared to encourage the activist monks to believe that their anti-war and
anti-American views were important for national policy.
Duong Van Minh failed to establish successful working relations with civilian
politicians, with his fellow generals, and with the Americans. The cabinet

appointed by the generals to administer the country excluded some groups, such
as the Dai Viet and the Hoa Hao, who instinctively began to work to bring down
the government. There was also a falling out into factions among the generals
themselves. General Tran Thien Khiem (b.1925), a Catholic and godson of Ngo
Dinh Diem, had joined the coup plot but resented Duong Van Minh’s decision to
kill the Ngo Dinh brothers. He and other military officers were dissatisfied with
how authority was apportioned after the coup. The Americans soon decided that
the results of the coup were a step backwards in terms of government stability
and battlefield performance. The military situation had begun to shift in late
summer when the attention of the commanding generals was diverted from
fighting to plotting. In the wake of the coup, many experienced and competent
officers and officials were discarded, the battlefield situation became grim, and
Duong Van Minh had no plans.
Under the new American President, Lyndon Baines Johnson (1908–1973),
initiative for policy shifted from the embassy of Ambassador Lodge to the
MACV command of General Harkins. Harkins had never agreed with the
scheme for removing Ngo Dinh Diem, and he had little esteem for the group of
opportunistic generals gathered around Duong Van Minh. He identified General
Nguyen Khanh (b.1927) as someone more likely to share the American concern
to fight communists and encouraged him to take power. Nguyen Khanh, like
Duong Van Minh, was the son of a wealthy Cochinchina landlord. He had
received military training in France in the late1940s and in the US in the late
1950s. He had helped to foil the1960 coup plot. In1963, with a command just
north of Saigon, he had remained aloof from the plotters until joining the coup as
it occurred. Duong Van Minh then reassigned him to command the northern part
of the country, which made him very dissatisfied. His new second-in-command
was Nguyen Chanh Thi (1923–2007), who had been a prominent member of the
1960 coup attempt against Ngo Dinh Diem and had gone into Cambodian exile
until rehabilitated in November 1963. Nguyen Khanh, along with Nguyen
Chanh Thi, Tran Thien Khiem, and other officers who were alienated by
Duong Van Minh’s lack of initiative, his vulnerability to the Buddhist activists,
and his inability to maximize benefits from the American relationship staged a
mostly bloodless coup at the end of January1964 with the active encouragement
and support of the Americans.
Nguyen Khanh was the pre-eminent figure in the Saigon government for the
next year. He was opportunistic and he lacked political ability, but he was
indebted to the fact that American policy was in an era of passivity as Johnson
waited for the election of1964 to give him the political clout to respond to what
under Khanh’s wavering leadership became an increasingly chaotic situation.
Nguyen Khanh initially turned to the Dai Viet politicians who had been excluded

from power by both Ngo Dinh Diem and Duong Van Minh. But political parties
in Vietnam had arisen during French colonial rule and consequently were oppos-
itional, conspiratorial, and unwilling to take responsibility for governing. Fur-
thermore, the Dai Viet politicians did not form a coherent party organization but
rather had become groups vaguely allied as opponents of Ngo Dinh Diem.
There were at least four groups of Dai Viet politicians, three of them aligned in
factions associated with the three parts of Vietnam– north, center, and south.
The most prominent Dai Viet figure was Phan Huy Quat (1908–1979), whom
Nguyen Khanh made his Foreign Minister. Phan Huy Quat, a medical doctor,
was from the northern Dai Viet faction. He had served as Minister of Education
under Bao Dai in1949 and as Minster of Defense during the brief Nguyen Phan
Long government of1950, and again in the Nguyen Van Tam government of
1953–1954. He briefly served as acting Prime Minister in1954 between Buu Loc
and Ngo Dinh Diem and was touted by some as an alternative to Ngo Dinh Diem
in1954. He was a signer of the Caravelle Manifesto in1960. In February1964,
he refused to join some Dai Viet figures who were plotting to seize control of
Nguyen Khanh’s government. This plot disabused Nguyen Khanh of relying on
civilian politicians associated with“parties.”
Because he had overthrown those who had eliminated Ngo Dinh Diem,
Nguyen Khanh was vulnerable to accusations of wanting to re-establish the
Catholic regime of the Ngo Dinh family. His support of the Dai Viet politicians
was intended to negate this accusation because the Dai Viet politicians had the
reputation of being opponents of Ngo Dinh Diem. However, when he realized
that the non-sectarian political parties, including the Dai Viet, were incoherent
and untrustworthy because of their lack of organization and their conspiratorial
culture of opposition, he began to look elsewhere for a political base. During the
spring and summer of1964, he attempted to cultivate the support of the Bud-
dhist monks and of the younger generation of military officers.
After the overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, activist Buddhist leaders reorgan-
ized themselves into the Vietnamese Buddhist United Church, which included
around three thousand monks and six hundred nuns and claimed three million
lay adherents. They became experts at pressuring Saigon governments with
street demonstrations. Student groups, particularly in Saigon, being inspired
and influenced by the Buddhists, had developed their own style of street
politics beginning in the late summer of1963, and they continued their efforts
to affect national policy during 1964.I nM a y 1964, the Buddhists and
students successfully demanded that Nguyen Khanh kill Ngo Dinh Can to
prove that he had repudiated Ngo Dinh Diem’s political heritage. From this,
they understood that Nguyen Khanh was a weak leader who could be pres-
sured from the streets.

More important than the civilian politicians or the Buddhists and students
were the junior colleagues of Nguyen Khanh in the military. He was a relatively
lonely generational figure between the Francophile senior generals who had
gathered around Duong Van Minh and junior officers who represented a more
pro-American and anti-communist perspective. During the first half of1964,
Nguyen Khanh made sure to recognize the loyalty of his junior colleagues with
promotions. Aside from Nguyen Chanh Thi, two other prominent figures in this
group of so-called“Young Turks” were Nguyen Van Thieu (1923–2001) and
Nguyen Cao Ky (1930–2011). Nguyen Van Thieu, from a coastal region not far
north of Saigon, had converted to Catholicism during Ngo Dinh Diem’s rule. In
1963, he was the commander of a key unit near Saigon and had joined the coup
against Ngo Dinh Diem when it became clear that it was going to succeed. He
subsequently joined the plot led by Nguyen Khanh. He was a cautious man,
determined to be on the winning side of military politics and convinced that the
exercise of power depended upon American support. Nguyen Cao Ky, a pilot
who had become the commander of the air force, was also alert to the winds of
change. However, unlike Nguyen Van Thieu, who was introverted and secretive,
Nguyen Cao Ky was open, outspoken, transparent, and with no hint of
corruption.
As Nguyen Khanh endeavored to keep his position atop the shifting sands of
Saigon politics, American policy prepared for greater intervention as it became
clear that the battlefield situation had turned dramatically against Saigon after
the death of Ngo Dinh Diem. No major initiative was politically possible until
after the presidential election of November1964. Until then, US policy in
Vietnam was subordinated to electoral politics. Nevertheless, early in his
presidency, Johnson had authorized sabotage and intelligence gathering oper-
ations by Taiwanese and Vietnamese commandos along the coast of North
Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin. In August1964, this resulted in an attack by
North Vietnamese patrol boats upon a US destroyer, just at a time when Johnson
needed to demonstrate his anti-communist resolve to silence criticisms from his
presidential opponent. He ordered a retaliatory air strike against North Vietnam
and obtained congressional approval of the so-called“Gulf of Tonkin Reso-
lution” that authorized him to wage war in Southeast Asia. This helped Johnson
to silence his militant critics, but it also had an effect upon Saigon politics.
During the summer of1964, Buddhist militants organized the National Salva-
tion Council with provincial committees to stage demonstrations against what
they continued to view as the danger of a return to power of Ngo Dinh Diem’s
people. Many public confrontations with Catholics turned violent, and Catholics
began to denounce what they viewed as religious persecution. Activists on both
sides influenced student groups, who began to stage demonstrations in Saigon

not directly related to religion. In late July, students led a large demonstration in
Saigon denouncing what they saw as French interference in Vietnamese affairs.
Nguyen Khanh appeared irresolute amidst the clamor of street politics.
The Gulf of Tonkin episode with retaliatory US air strikes on North
Vietnam and a warlike congressional re solution inspired Nguyen Khanh
to try some similarly dramatic initiative to overcome his reputation for vacil-
lation. He declared a national emerge ncy, imposed press censorship, and
persuaded his military colleagues to issue the Vung Tau Charter, giving him
near-dictatorial powers. After ten days of public demonstrations in which
Buddhists denounced these moves and mobs of Buddhist and Catholic youth

Tau Charter.
Nguyen Khanh’s military colleagues were losing confidence in him, yet no one
else was in a position to push him aside. Maxwell Taylor had just replaced Lodge
as US ambassador and, at the same time, General William Childs Westmoreland
(1914–2005) replaced Harkins as MACV commander. Taylor and Westmore-
land wanted to avoid any dramatic political change while rebuilding a civilian
government.
By the end of August, Nguyen Khanh entered a kind of triumvirate with
Duong Van Minh and Tran Thien Khiem. In mid September, Tran Thien Khiem
was implicated in a coup attempt plotted by two other Catholic generals and,
consequently, sent out of the country to be ambassador to the US. The Young
Turks thwarted the coup and their influence accordingly grew. In November,
Duong Van Minh was eased out and sent abroad as a“roving ambassador.”
Meanwhile, in early September the High National Council was formed of sixteen
civilians with responsibility to write a constitution, to function as a temporary
national assembly, and to restore a civilian administration.
Phan Khac Suu (1893–1970) was chosen as Chairman of the High National
Council. He was an agricultural engineer and a member of the Cao Dai who had
served in Bao Dai’s cabinets. He had signed the Caravelle Manifesto in1960 and
was subsequently jailed by Ngo Dinh Diem. Under his leadership, at the end of
October, the High National Council promulgated a“provisional charter” to
serve as a temporary constitution. He was elevated to serve as Chief of State, and
he chose Tran Van Huong (1902–1982) to be the prime minister. Tran Van
Huong had a reputation for honesty and competence. A secondary school
teacher, he spent most of the French war working for the Vietnamese Red Cross
in southern Vietnam. Under Ngo Dinh Diem, he was the mayor of Saigon for
several months and then became Secretary General of the Vietnamese Red Cross
Society, a position he held when he signed the Caravelle Manifesto in1960.
Duong Van Minh made him a member of his powerless Council of Notables after

the coup against Ngo Dinh Diem. He was once again the mayor of Saigon when
Phan Khac Suu called on him to be Prime Minister.
Tran Van Huong stood for establishing public order against the street politics
of the student and Buddhist activists. He sponsored a Buddhist church organiza-
tion of monks opposed to the militancy of Thich Tri Quang and insisted that
politics and religion should not be mixed. Although his ability to exercise strong
leadership was hindered by controversy over his selection of cabinet ministers in
the High National Council, now functioning as a legislative body, he forcefully
responded to Saigon street disturbances in late November by declaring a state of
emergency, closing schools, banning public meetings, and authorizing the local
military commander, General Pham Van Dong (1919–2008), to search and
arrest without warrant. These measures were popular in Saigon where street
politics had been disrupting life for months, but Nguyen Khanh and the Young
Turks viewed Pham Van Dong as a potential rival.
Pham Van Dong had a long record of service in the French and Vietnamese
armies. Americans praised his competence on the battlefield, and he had a
reputation for being politically astute and personally honest. He kept a small
private army of men from a northern upland ethnic minority, into which he had
married, and accordingly enjoyed a measure of independence in relation to other
military officers. Tran Van Huong’s reliance upon him to restore a semblance of
public order raised the profiles of both men as effective leaders. However, the
Buddhist activists, whose influence on government depended upon their skill in
street politics, were unhappy. Nguyen Khanh, who remained susceptible to the
idea of increasing his authority in alliance with the militant Buddhists, was also
unhappy. Neither were the Young Turks happy with the ascendancy of Pham
Van Dong, which threatened to intercept their path to power.
Nguyen Chanh Thi, a prominent Young Turk, was closely associated with
both Nguyen Khanh and the militant monks based at Hue. When the High
National Council resisted pressure to expand its membership to include support-
ers of Thich Tri Quang, the young generals demanded that it pass a law to retire
military officers after twenty-five years of service. This measure was aimed at
Pham Van Dong, who had enlisted in1939, a year earlier than Duong Van
Minh. When this demand was refused, Nguyen Khanh and his young colleagues
dissolved the High National Council and arrested some of its members along
with other political figures. They nevertheless continued to express support for
the Tran Van Huong government and pretended that the powers of the High
National Council had passed to Phan Khac Suu. This action weakened Tran Van
Huong while strengthening Nguyen Khanh and the Buddhist activists.
Taylor reacted angrily to the apparent reassertion of Nguyen Khanh’s author-
ity and to the setback in building a civilian government. The two men fell out,

each demanding that the other leave the country. Tran Van Huong managed to
defuse the situation and by mid January1965 had restored a measure of calm to
Vietnamese–American relations. Taylor’s reaction was to some extent aggra-
vated by American plans to escalate involvement in Vietnam, which after the
US presidential election were now rising in priority. The Americans wanted a
stable civilian Vietnamese government to facilitate and legitimize an increase in
US involvement. Nevertheless, political turmoil in Saigon continued during the
next two months as dry-season battlefield activity intensified and American
military intervention began to materialize.
In late January, Tran Van Huong aimed to strengthen his government by
proposing a new cabinet that included four generals. This prompted Buddhist
militants led by Thich Tri Quang to call for Tran Van Houng’s resignation and to
mobilize violent anti-American demonstrations in Saigon and in Hue. Respond-
ing to this, Nguyen Khanh solicited Buddhist support by persuading the generals
to remove Tran Van Huong from office.
By mid February, Nguyen Khanh had named Phan Huy Quat to be prime
minister. Phan Huy Quat, a Dai Viet leader who had been in Nguyen Khanh’s
first cabinet, was a Buddhist from the north widely considered to be a political
enemy of those who had supported Ngo Dinh Diem. Most of the men he
appointed to his cabinet were from the north or center of the country. He was
acceptable to the Buddhist militants, but Catholics and southerners distrusted
him.
In late February, southern Catholic officers attempted to stage a coup that was
suppressed by Nguyen Chanh Thi and other generals who took the occasion to
send Nguyen Khanh into exile. Thereafter, as American bombing of North
Vietnam started and American troops began to arrive, Nguyen Chanh Thi
established himself in the Hue/Da Nang region of the central coast with strong
Buddhist support. Meanwhile, the Phan Huy Quat government limped along in
Saigon, handicapped by its unpopularity among Catholics and southerners,
which prompted another unsuccessful coup attempt in late May.
By early June, the government was paralyzed by a dispute between Phan Huy
Quat and Chief of State Phan Khac Suu over the composition of the cabinet.
The National Legislative Council, which had been formed in February to
replace the High National Council, was too weak to solve the problem. Conse-
quently, Phan Huy Quat resigned and handed the government back to the
generals, who decided on Nguyen VanThieu as Chief of State and Nguyen
Cao Ky as Prime Minister. These two generals, along with Nguyen Chanh Thi,
had emerged as the most influential among the military officers after Nguyen
Khanh’s departure. Nguyen Chanh Thi preferred to establish his personal
bailiwick in the northern part of the country rather than to enter the politics

of the Saigon-based generals. In mid June, Nguyen Cao Ky formed a war
cabinet as American intervention accelerated.
Formation of the Second Republic of Vietnam
Lyndon Johnson accepted the American commitment to defeat the communist
attempt to take over South Vietnam, but he subordinated the implementation of
this commitment to the presidential election of1964 and to his ambitious
domestic legislative agenda, which occupied him during the first half of1965.
Consequently, when, in March1965, he opened direct American participation in
the war, he endeavored to minimize drawing attention to it. The Hanoi govern-
ment had been rapidly increasing its military involvement in the south ever since
the death of Ngo Dinh Diem, hoping to gain victory before the US could react. By
early1965, the military position of the Saigon government was deteriorating so
quickly that direct American intervention was needed to avoid a debacle. Phan
Huy Quat was not enthusiastic about American intervention but had no way of
resisting it. The generals understood that American intervention ensured the
survival of their armed forces and would fundamentally change the context of
Vietnamese politics in their favor.
After four months of a US bombing campaign against North Vietnam and of
piecemeal deployments of thousands of American ground troops to South Viet-
nam, in July of1965 Johnson finally announced his policy toward Vietnam. He
proposed an open-ended increase in US troops, the amount to be determined by
the number necessary to obtain his aim, which was to persuade Hanoi to
abandon its policy of seizing the south. His approach followed a“limited war”
theory that had been developed by some academics, which proposed that one
could persuade an enemy to renounce its goal through a limited application of
military action; it was not necessary to actually force defeat upon an enemy in
order to obtain one’s own goal but merely to convince an opponent that it was in
its best interest to stop fighting. This theory was combined with the“flexible
response” idea that Kennedy had ostensibly embraced to produce the concept of
“graduated pressure,” according to which the US would apply increasing levels
of military action in Vietnam until Hanoi decided to give up.
Ambassador Taylor had argued against the deployment of ground troops,
fearing that it would destroy the nationalist credentials of the anti-communist
Vietnamese. Johnson replaced him with Lodge, who for the next two years
watched from the embassy as more and more American troops arrived. Without
a clear strategy for defeating the enemy and gaining victory, American forces
concentrated upon logistics, at which they excelled, moving men and material

halfway around the world to Vietnam. Westmoreland was tasked with using his
increasing resources to cause maximum battlefield damage to the enemy. Handi-
capped by being unable to control the movement of men and materials through
Laos and Cambodia into Vietnam, Westmoreland resorted to a policy of“search
and destroy” in which American forces endeavored to locate and apply their
superior firepower to communist forces. The result was that communist forces
learned how to be“found” in ways that maximized their advantages and conse-
quently they were able to initiate around80 percent of all combat encounters. It
began to look like a war of attrition by1966 and 1967.
The momentum of American escalation pushed aside the South Vietnamese
army and it was relegated to so-called“pacification duties,” dealing with local
insurgents and the chaos in civilian life caused by the increase in warfare.
Meanwhile, American forces attempted to engage the units of the North Viet-
namese army that increasingly appeared from across the Laotian and Cambo-
dian borders. In addition to the land route from North Vietnam through
southern Laos, supplies also reached communist forces by ship to the Cambodian
port of Sihanoukville. Sihanouk allowed the movement of military supplies
through Cambodia to the Vietnamese border in exchange for a percentage of
the shipments.
The first major battle between American and North Vietnamese army units
occurred in autumn1965 at what became known as the Battle of Ia Drang, in the
Central Highlands near the Cambodian border, in which US airmobile units,
recently arrived from the US, endeavored to destroy a large concentration of
North Vietnamese soldiers. The North Vietnamese considered the battle a victory
because, after inflicting significant casualties upon the Americans, they were able
to withdraw in good order across the Cambodian border where they enjoyed
immunity from American attack. Although Americans officially claimed the
battle as a victory because their casualties were fewer than those of the North
Vietnamese, McNamara’s analysis of the battle was the beginning of his doubts
about the war. He concluded that the bombing campaign could not sufficiently
diminish the movement of men and materials into the south nor could US search
and destroy operations disable North Vietnamese units fast enough for any
discernible scenario leading to success. Although McNamara persuaded Johnson
to order a brief bombing halt in early1966 to explore the possibility of negoti-
ations, the basic war policy remained unchanged with continued bombing and
ever-increasing numbers of US troops being sent to South Vietnam.
By early1966, the activist monks based in Hue were pressing for the election
of a constituent assembly to write a constitution and to re-establish a civilian
government. The Americans also endorsed this agenda. Ambassador Lodge, who
in1963 had established a good relationship with Thich Tri Quang, endeavored

to keep the Buddhists calm while nudging the Nguyen Cao Ky government in this
direction. Complicating this issue was the personal falling out between Nguyen
Chanh Thi, who was closely associated with Thich Tri Quang, and the Saigon
generals, which exacerbated the alienation of the Buddhist population in the
northern part of the country from the government in Saigon.
After Nguyen Cao Ky was publicly insulted during a visit to Hue and Da Nang
in early March, the Saigon generals decided to relieve Nguyen Chanh Thi of his
command. In response to this, Thich Tri Quang began to broadcast anti-
government messages from the Hue radio station and a resistance movement
led by monks and students spread to major cities along the central coast and in
the Central Highlands, and also to Saigon. In addition to calling for an end to the
military government, the demonstrators also aired anti-American slogans. They
expressed a Buddhist fear that the military government was bringing back offi-
cials who had worked for the Ngo Dinh brothers as well as a more general
dismay at the increasing numbers of US combat troops in the country and the
expansion of warfare.
During the following three months, two important developments simultan-
eously occurred. Soldiers, teachers, students, and others in the Hue–Da Nang
region joined Buddhist activists in resistance against the Saigon government. This
was eventually suppressed by force, and many of the most militantly anti-
government people fled to join the communists in the mountains. At the same
time, and to some extent as a political response to the revolt, a committee was
formed to draft laws for electing and administering a constituent assembly that
would write a constitution. The work of this committee was completed and
approved in June1966, just as the revolt was coming to an end.
The election for the constituent assembly was held in September1966 with
401 candidates standing for117 seats and around80 percent of the electorate
participating. The election revealed strong regional and sectarian differences.
Initially, the largest bloc was mainly comprised of people from north and central
Vietnam and included Dai Viet politicians, some Catholics and a few people
associated with the military. This bloc was eventually equaled in size by the
combination of a Catholic group and a group of southerners led by Hoa Hao
leaders that attracted some independents and formed a bloc that supported
Nguyen Cao Ky’s efforts to mediate between the assembly and the generals.
There was a smaller bloc of militant southern regionalists, an echo of the old
Cochinchinese separatist movement of the late1940s. The Buddhist activists had
been discredited by the revolt and consequently there was no significant bloc of
people representing their agenda.
In October, as the constituent assembly was organizing itself, a crisis erupted
when southerners in Nguyen Cao Ky’s cabinet threatened to resign over what
599 / From two countries to one

they viewed as discriminatory treatment of southerners in favor of northerners.
This crisis resonated with the formation of regional blocks in the constituent
assembly. Nguyen Cao Ky, a northerner, succeeded in calming the matter and
maintaining the unity of his cabinet. He thereafter gave much attention to
negotiating compromises between the constituent assembly and the generals.
The constitution that was finally completed and approved in March1967 was
the result of significant concessions from both groups. It provided for a strong
presidency, a bicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary.
After a complex series of procedures and maneuvers in the summer of1967,
eleven men were officially approved to run for president. Although Nguyen Cao
Ky was keen to run for president, his military colleagues forced him to run for
vice president under Nguyen Van Thieu, who was his senior in rank; the generals
feared that without a united military ticket they could lose the election. Of the ten
civilian candidates, Phan Khac Suu and Tran Van Huong were the most prom-
inent. Thich Tri Quang called on his followers to boycott the election.
The election was held under the gaze of dozens of American and other
international observers. Despite many problems, it was generally evaluated as
an accomplishment on the road toward building a democratic political system in
wartime. Despite the advantage of holding power, the military ticket received
only around35 percent of the votes. Phan Khac Suu and Tran Van Huong polled
well in the cities with each receiving around10 percent of the votes. Two other
candidates received between5 and 10 percent, and five candidates received less
than 5 percent. The surprise of the election was that a man named Truong Dinh
Dzu came in second with around17 percent of the votes.
Truong Dinh Dzu (1917–1980s), originally from Binh Dinh Province, studied
law in Hanoi and from1945 practiced law in Saigon. He was rumored to have
communist acquaintances, but he also had business relations with people related
to Ngo Dinh Diem. He was an active member of the Rotary Club, becoming the
head of the Rotary Club organization in Southeast Asia. He had been investi-
gated for bribery, illegally transferring funds abroad, and tax irregularities, but
nevertheless managed to gain approval to run for president. He was an effective
speaker and attracted attention with his platform of peace and of negotiation
with the communists. He ran well in contested rural areas that were susceptible
to communist influence. After the election he was jailed on a currency transaction
charge.
The Second Republic of Vietnam was inaugurated at the end of October1967
after completion of National Assembly elections. The government was a civilian–
military hybrid, a structure inhabited by military authority with built-in demo-
cratic tendencies that required ongoing negotiation and compromise with civilian
constituents. During the year and a half of preparing and bringing into operation

the new constitution, American intervention rose to half a million troops in the
country. This dominating American presence had a stabilizing influence on the
country’s politics. In 1967, Ellsworth Bunker (1894–1984) was named US
ambassador. He was an experienced, competent, and effective career diplomat
who, during his six years in Saigon, preserved a predominantly cooperative
relationship between the US government and Nguyen Van Thieu. Nguyen Van
Thieu’s lack of ability as a political leader was to some extent offset by his
caution, his consistency, his mastery of military politics, and his ability to work
with Americans.
During the four years between the end of the Ngo Dinh regime and the
beginning of the Second Republic, the politics of South Vietnam developed
amidst an externally supported insurgency and a massive American intervention.
A large theme was competition for ascendancy between the two groups that had
brought down Ngo Dinh Diem: the Buddhist activists and the military officers.
Eventually, the Buddhists were forced to yield. Within the military, a junior
cohort relatively susceptible to American influence came to the fore. A large
and varied population of civilian politicians, often with strong sectarian and
regional affiliations, actively participated in the many experiments in govern-
ment. After a year of negotiation and compromise, a constitutional structure was
adopted that provided a legal framework for politics and administration until
dismantled by the communists seven and a half years later.
The communist offensive of 1968
Between the1959 decision to force a military solution upon the southern
question and the death of Ngo Dinh Diem in1963, Le Duan and his associates
in Hanoi were constrained by party members who believed that economic
development was a higher priority than military confrontation with the south
and that, in fact, developing a strong economy was an essential first step toward
overcoming the south. The Le Duan leadership group tightened its control over
the party, the army, and intellectuals during the third party congress in late1960,
but internal resistance and the indifference of China and the Soviet Union
continued to inhibit policy toward Saigon. By late1962, after the strategic
hamlet program was launched and Kennedy escalated American military involve-
ment, there was much uncertainty and vacillation in the party. After the agree-
ment to neutralize Laos was completed in the summer of1962, the Soviet Union
lost interest in Southeast Asia. China continued to support the Laotian and
Vietnamese communists but was distracted by mass starvation and by border
tensions with India, Taiwan, and the Soviet Union. Party leadership in Hanoi

was divided over the relative importance of the Soviet model of a centralized
bureaucratic state and the Chinese model of mass mobilization and permanent
revolution.
The November1963 coup in Saigon awakened the Hanoi leadership from the
conundrums of socialist internationalism and its manifestations within the Viet-
namese party. The sudden, dramatic dismantling of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime
opened the prospect of victory in the south much sooner than it had been thought
possible. Within weeks of Ngo Dinh Diem’s death, the central committee of the
party resolved upon an aggressive policy of “general offensive and general
uprising” to take over the south. Dissenting party members were demoted,
marginalized, put under house arrest, or imprisoned. Students in the Soviet Bloc
countries were recalled for re-education. A campaign to enforce intellectual
conformity among writers and artists was launched. North Vietnamese army
units began to move into South Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia.
By the time of the1965 Johnson escalation, Khrushchev had been deposed,
and the new Soviet leadership challenged the expansion of American military
action in Vietnam by giving strong support to Hanoi. China followed suit and
within two years stationed nearly two hundred thousand troops between the
Chinese border and Hanoi. The Chinese troops handled air defense, logistics,
and construction. Their presence enabled the Vietnamese to allocate more man-
power to the south.
Nguyen Chi Thanh, the commander of communist forces in South Vietnam,
believed that the Vietnamese disadvantage in battlefield technology could be
overcome by high morale. He aimed to break the will of Americans to fight in
Vietnam by seeking direct engagement with American units to inflict maximum
casualties. The high cost of this strategy provoked dissent within the North
Vietnamese army. In1966 and the first half of1967, Vo Nguyen Giap spoke
out against what he considered to be the wasting of the army in high casualty
engagements. He advocated an emphasis on guerrilla operations and protracted
warfare to minimize the damage suffered from superior US firepower. In reply,
Nguyen Chi Thanh argued that the US strategy of limited war and attrition could
be overcome by an aggressive strategy that prevented Americans from becoming
comfortable in Vietnam and that a shift to guerrilla warfare would damage the
morale of the communist soldiers.
Voices of moderation within the party began to rise as the human and material
cost of the war became increasingly apparent. US bombing disrupted and
degraded the country’s industrial and transportation infrastructure and forced
major relocations of population. Many party members were dismayed to see
plans for economic development sacrificed to a war they considered unnecessary.
They called for peace talks to end the war, believing that a better way to unify the

country was through economic development, confident that a vibrant socialist
economy would eventually overwhelm southern resistance. These people were
encouraged by the growing involvement of the Soviet Union in the war effort.
They admired the Soviet model of state building, being repelled by the chaos of
China’s Cultural Revolution, and they supported the Soviet Union’s call for a
negotiated settlement.
By 1967, the rising involvement of both the Soviet Union and China in the war
brought the Sino-Soviet conflict into the center of party politics. The Soviet
Union provided military material for conventional war but advocated negoti-
ations with the Americans. China advocated a protracted guerrilla war and
opposed negotiations. In mid1967, disagreements within the army about battle-
field strategy and pressures from rival allies about diplomatic strategy became
entangled with the problem of party leadership. The death of Nguyen Chi Thanh
and the declining health of Ho Chi Minh raised the profile of Vo Nguyen Giap
and the prospect of a challenge to Le Duan’s position at the head of the party. Le
Duan felt the need to reassert his authority by distancing himself from his foreign
allies and silencing his domestic critics.
Prior to his death in July 1967, Nguyen Chi Thanh proposed a major
offensive in 1968 to break the seeming stalemate on the battlefield, to rally
the southern population behind the party, and to turn back the tide of Ameri-
can intervention. The virtue of this proposal was that it asserted a Vietnamese
strategy for victory that rebuffed both the Chinese advocacy of protracted
guerrilla warfare and the Soviet advocacy for a negotiated peace settlement.
This would enable Le Duan to separate himself from both allies, thereby
avoiding the morass of their rivalry.
The debate about battlefield strategy ended with Nguyen Chi Thanh’s death.
Without him, Le Duan’s control of the army was threatened. Le Duan countered
opposition to Nguyen Chi Thanh’s plans by purging party members inclined
toward a guerrilla strategy and peace talks; these people viewed Vo Nguyen
Giap, now the dominant military figure, as their leading spokesman. During the
last half of1967 as plans for the1968 offensive were completed and negotiating
possibilities were rejected, several hundred people were disciplined or arrested,
including members of Vo Nguyen Giap’s personal staff; this series of purges was
called the “revisionist anti-party affair.” Plans for the offensive of1968 were
closely related to Le Duan countering threats to his authority both from his
foreign allies and from within the ruling party. Beginning in the late1950s, Le
Duan and Le Duc Tho repeatedly renewed their ascendancy in the party by
enforcing their policy of war to conquer the south. The purges of late1967
brought an end to debates that had begun with the decision to accelerate this
policy that had been prompted by Ngo Dinh Diem’s death.

At the end of January1968, Hanoi initiated the first phase of its offensive. Six
cities, thirty-six provincial capitals, and sixty-four district capitals were attacked,
primarily by the People’s Liberation Armed Forces, commonly called the Viet
Cong, the military arm of the communist movement in the south. The attacks
were rapidly defeated everywhere except in Hue. The communists held Hue for
about a month, during which time people from Hue who had joined the com-
munists after the revolt in spring1966 returned and attempted to establish a
revolutionary regime. The communists arrested around three thousand people in
Hue; most of these were later found massacred in shallow graves outside the city.
A second wave of attacks in May and a third wave in August were on a much-
reduced scale and were no more successful.
One result of the offensive was that the southern communists were virtually
wiped out as a military force and thereafter the North Vietnamese army was
forced to assume a defensive pose; the communists lost control of much of the
territory that they had previously taken. On the other side, the new government
of the Second Republic in Saigon benefited from a rise of popular support as
people rallied against the attackers with a new sense of appreciation for what
was at stake. For many people in relatively protected urban areas, what had been
a war in the countryside was suddenly in their streets and homes. The fighting of
1968strengthened the Saigon government and stimulated a surge of volunteers
into its armed forces.
What anti-communist Vietnamese experienced as a victory, American report-
ers, opinion makers, and politicians perceived as a defeat. The reason for this was
that Johnson’s limited war strategy did not account for the vital connection
between Le Duan’s leadership and Hanoi’s uncompromising pursuit of victory
in the south. There was no way to persuade Le Duan to renounce his war policy
in the south because his authority depended upon it. Yielding to American
pressure would have meant the downfall of Le Duan and his associates, which
they were determined to prevent. American public opinion turned away from the
war when the1968 offensive revealed that the enemy was far from giving up.
Johnson saw that he was politically vulnerable and decided against running for
re-election. At the same time, at the end of March1968, he responded to
criticism of his policy in Vietnam by unilaterally restricting US bombing of North
Vietnam to an area on its southern border and by calling for negotiations to end
the war.
Seeing the effect of the offensive on American politics and sensing that the
American will to continue the war had been broken, Hanoi agreed to peace talks,
which opened in Paris at the beginning of May1968. From the beginning, the
peace talks served the non-negotiable American desire to disengage from the war
and the non-negotiable Hanoi determination to gain control of South Vietnam.

On the other hand, the survival of an independent non-communist South Viet-
nam was negotiable. In June, the National Assembly in Saigon protested the US
negotiating matters related to South Vietnamese sovereignty without its partici-
pation, but Ambassador Bunker failed to obtain assurances from the State
Department that the Saigon government would be fully informed and consulted.
From the beginning, Hanoi demanded that the US cease all bombing of North
Vietnam as a precondition for continuing the talks. Johnson acceded to this
demand just before the presidential election in November1968. In late1968,
the US forced Nguyen Van Thieu to accept a negotiating formula of“two sides,
four parties” that compromised his government’s claim of sovereignty over
South Vietnam. The US and the Republic of Vietnam formed one side while
North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front were the other side. This
acknowledgment of equal status between the Republic of Vietnam and the
National Liberation Front as two governments each claiming to rule all of South
Vietnam became even more explicit a year later when the National Liberation
Front was redesigned as the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South
Vietnam. Despite the battlefield victories of1968, American eagerness to negoti-
ate an exit from the war forced the Republic of Vietnam into a negotiating stance
that threatened its continued existence.
US redeployment out of Vietnam
When the two-sided four-party Paris peace talks began in early1969, it was
quickly apparent that they were little more than a propaganda platform. Hanoi
was occupied with rebuilding its military capability in the south without the large
southern component that had been sacrificed in1968 and was content to delay
serious negotiations until it had gained a stronger position on the battlefield.
Under strong political pressure to end American involvement in the war and with
the Paris negotiations at an impasse, the new administration of Richard Milhous
Nixon (1913–1994) shifted to a strategy of removing American forces from
Vietnam and giving responsibility for the anti-communist struggle back to the
South Vietnamese. This was possible because the Second Republic government in
Saigon was stable and enjoyed a relatively high measure of popular support, and
also because the communist defeats in1968 had temporarily, but significantly,
reduced the battlefield threat.
Secretary of Defense Melvin Robert Laird (b.1922) made plans to redeploy
nearly all American military forces out of Vietnam by the end of1972. The
first redeployment was announced in the summer of1969 and the drawdown
continued thereafter on schedule. General Creighton Williams Abrams, Jr.

(1914–1974), who replaced Westmoreland in1968, espoused a new strategy of
“one war,” which aimed to integrate the operations of the Vietnamese and
American armies and also to integrate civilian and military operations.
Under Westmoreland’s command, the Vietnamese army was for the most part
pushed aside from battlefield responsibilities as American forces conducted
search and destroy operations. Furthermore, the equipment provided by the
Americans to the Vietnamese was generally inferior to that available to commun-
ist forces, particularly in the quality of small arms and individual weapons.
Under Abrams, the South Vietnamese army was equipped with up-to-date
weapons that were equivalent to the quality of arms used by its enemy. Abrams
organized joint Vietnamese–American operations that were to some extent
designed as training exercises. As American redeployment progressed, the Viet-
namese increasingly assumed responsibility for defending the country. At the
same time, American programs for assisting civilians in battle zones that from
1967had begun to be integrated into American military operations were turned
over to the Vietnamese. These policies, commonly referred to as“Vietnamiza-
tion,” needed time for implementation, and major campaigns in Cambodia and
Laos during1970 and 1971 aimed to gain time by keeping communist forces off
balance and away from South Vietnamese cities.
In early1970, the Cambodian army commander, Lon Nol, who opposed the
arrangements that had allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodian
territory, deposed Sihanouk. Sihanouk then joined a Chinese-sponsored alliance
between the Vietnamese and Cambodian communists as Lon Nol appealed to the
US for assistance. South Vietnamese and American forces advanced into Cam-
bodia, forcing the Vietnamese communists to evacuate their headquarters and
supply bases. These events were accompanied by widespread massacres of Viet-
namese residing in Cambodia, victims of Cambodian resentment against the
dominance of Vietnamese communists that Sihanouk had allowed in the eastern
part of the country. Americans and South Vietnamese believed that this oper-
ation, which continued into the summer of1970, helped to keep Vietnamese
battlefields relatively quiet for a year, enabling the Vietnamization process to
gain momentum. Opposition to this operation in the US Congress, however,
resulted in a law prohibiting American ground troops from thereafter entering
Cambodia or Laos.
War continued between Lon Nol and the Cambodian and Vietnamese com-
munist forces, but the port of Sihanoukville was thereafter closed to the com-
munists, and North Vietnam became more dependent upon its supply lines
through southern Laos. In early1971, South Vietnamese forces entered southern
Laos in an operation designed to sever the communist supply lines during the
winter dry season. In a series of battles, North and South Vietnamese forces both

suffered heavy casualties. Although the initial aim of the operation was not
fully reached, North Vietnamese plans were sufficiently disrupted to give the
Vietnamization policy another year of relative calm. By early 1972,t h e
number of US ground troops in Vietnam was insignificant and the American
presence had become more like the Kennedy phase of advising with logistical
and air support.
At the international level, Nixon endeavored to exploit the deepening Sino-
Soviet dispute by diplomatically engaging each of these major communist powers
and persuading them that they had more to gain from strengthening relations
with the US than from supporting the North Vietnamese. Nixon understood that
the Cold War was shifting from a bipolar confrontation toward a three-corner
game with possibilities for prying one or both of the communist powers away
from Hanoi. China had begun to withdraw its troops from North Vietnam after
the end of American bombing and the beginning of American redeployment, and
it began to be apparent that the Chinese were not in favor of Hanoi gaining
control of South Vietnam. While China had supported Hanoi so long as the
American presence in South Vietnam was on a threatening scale, it was not keen
to have a united Vietnam on its southern border. On the other hand, the Soviet
Union was ready to provide Hanoi with all that it needed to conquer the south
and thereby gain a potential ally in the increasingly rancorous confrontations
that were characterizing Sino-Soviet relations.
The troubled state of Sino-Soviet relations made both powers want to
strengthen ties with the US in order to isolate the other. Nixon enjoyed the
benefit of China and of the Soviet Union competing to build strategic relation-
ships with the US. There were plans for Nixon to visit both countries during the
first half of1972. Le Duan understood that the international situation was
changing in a direction that threatened to downgrade the importance of North
Vietnam to its allies and decided to try for a quick military victory.
The Second Republic
North Vietnamese leaders worried not only about the diminishing importance of
their struggle in the context of world politics but also about the success of the
Second Republic in stabilizing South Vietnam. Nguyen Van Thieu was not a very
inspiring leader, but neither was he known for either excessive corruption or
egregious abuse of power. He was a relatively competent administrator, and he
was inclined to avoid violating constitutional formalities. He countenanced
opposition in the legislature, a judiciary to some extent beyond his control, and
relative freedom of the press without prior censorship. To an extent, his behavior

was influenced by American expectations as Ambassador Bunker endeavored to
gently coach him about American norms of constitutional practice.
Elections for the National Assembly under the Second Republic elicited par-
ticipation by a wide range of groups. The first Senate election was held at the
same time as the presidential election in early September1967. The sixty-member
Senate was elected with a system of ten-member slates; the six slates that received
the most votes were elected. Of sixty-four aspiring slates, forty-eight were
approved to stand for election. Two slates associated with Thich Tri Quang’s
militant Buddhists were among those not approved. A moderate Buddhist slate
was approved, but did not win election. Slates associated with the Hoa Hao, with
Nguyen Cao Ky, and with Truong Dinh Dzu were approved but were also
unsuccessful in the election. The successful slates included people who had both
supported and opposed Ngo Dinh Diem but they were generally favorable
toward Nguyen Van Thieu. Around40 percent of those elected were Catholics.
Although Catholics amounted to not much more than10 percent of the popula-
tion, they were more organized than others, and they strongly supported the
Second Republic.
Three years later, half of the senators, who had drawn three-year terms, as
opposed to the regular six-year senatorial term, either stood for re-election or
stood down from the Senate. In the1970 senatorial election, sixteen of eighteen
aspiring ten-member slates were approved, and a slate supported by the militant
Buddhists led by Thich Tri Quang was one of the three slates elected. Among the
new senators seated in this election were members of the Hoa Hao and the Cao
Dai, a Khmer Theravada Buddhist, and a Cham Muslim. The results of this
election significantly increased the number of senators who opposed or were
critical of the government.
The last senatorial election was held in August1973, when the Second Repub-
lic was in the early stage of abandonment by the US and beginning to suffer
economic problems. Election rules were changed to make it more difficult for
oppositional politicians to be elected. Four fifteen-member slates were allowed to
campaign and two were elected. During the Second Republic, the Senate was
under strong presidential influence but not control; many senators were critical
of the government and forced it to publicly defend its policies. Even more lively
debate and opposition to the government was characteristic of the House of
Representatives.
In the first House election, held in October1967, more than1,150 candidates
competed for fewer than 150 seats. About one-third of those elected were
Buddhists, including several militant followers of Thich Tri Quang. Other major
religious groups represented were Catholics, who made up25 percent, and Hoa
Hao, 10 percent. Among those elected was Ho Huu Tuong, the Trotskyist

activist in the1930s who spent several years in French prisons. In the late1940s
he turned away from communism and worked as a journalist in Saigon. In1955,
he was imprisoned when he supported the sects against Ngo Dinh Diem. After
his release from prison in1964, he returned to journalism. When his slate for the
Senate election was disallowed, he ran for the House instead and served there to
the end of the Second Republic as a respected critic of the government.
The second and last election for the House, in which members held four-year
terms, was in August1971. Of members seeking re-election, only40 of 119 were
successful; of these40 about half supported the government and about half were
oppositional. The largest single bloc of winners were supporters of Thich Tri
Quang’s militant Buddhists, constituting15 percent of the House, of whom over
half were under the age of40. The new House in comparison with the outgoing
House was better educated, less corrupt, and included more independent and
oppositional members.
In these elections, voter turnout varied from around65 percent to85 percent
of registered voters. The relatively high percentage of voters may to some extent
be attributed to the importance of demonstrating one’s loyalty to the government
in wartime by being able to produce a voter card proving that one had voted. But
beyond this, considering the press coverage of the elections and the eagerness of
people to run for office, the Second Republic demonstrated a certain plausible
success as a government based on relatively free elections. There were many
charges of fraud in these elections, but there were procedures for investigating
them that came to depend upon an increasingly independent judiciary. Many
fraud charges were simply part of the political process as it was understood and
practiced at that time; losers charged fraud because they had asserted before the
election that they could lose only if there was fraud.
The Supreme Court was established in 1968 with justices chosen by the
National Assembly. It was generally comprised of highly qualified people and
included some who were openly critical of Nguyen Van Thieu’s administration.
In dealing with electoral fraud charges, it demonstrated that it had achieved
credibility as a relatively neutral interpreter of the law. During the course of its
existence, it established the procedure of judicial review and was not shy about
declaring legislation and administrative acts to be unconstitutional.
The most controversial election in the history of the Second Republic was the
October 1971 presidential election. During the preceding summer, Duong Van
Minh, who was living in retirement, and Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky were
poised to run against the incumbent. As a man out of power, Duong Van Minh
was perceived as an opposition candidate. He believed that he had a chance of
winning if Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu split the pro-government
vote. Conversely, Nguyen Van Thieu believed he could defeat Duong Van Minh

if Nguyen Cao Ky was out of the race. In June1971, after rancorous debate, the
National Assembly passed a new law requiring candidates to obtain a certain
number of endorsements from elected officials. Nguyen Van Thieu proceeded to
gather all available pro-government endorsements, shutting out Nguyen Cao Ky.
Duong Van Minh received the necessary endorsements, but when he saw that
Nguyen Cao Ky was disqualified he dropped out of the race. Shortly after this, the
Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal for Nguyen Van Thieu to accumulate
excessive endorsements. Although Nguyen Cao Ky was then approved to run, he
nevertheless quit the race, the result being that Nguyen Van Thieu ran for re-election
unopposed with Tran Van Huong as his vice presidential candidate. The election
further marginalized Nguyen Cao Ky and his followers while consolidating Nguyen
Van Thieu’s position, but the election also demonstrated that legislative and judicial
acts were accepted as matters of law and were not under executive control.
While constitutional development enabled participation in national politics by
a relatively diverse range of constituencies, dramatic developments in rural areas
were at least as important to the stability of the Second Republic. Southern
communists suffered a sharp decline in numbers and influence after the1968
fighting. Defections to the Second Republic reached an all-time high in1969.
Local government in rural areas experienced a minor revolution with elections
for village and hamlet officials. Furthermore, in a move resisted by the army but
popular among rural people and strongly pushed by Nguyen Van Thieu,
weapons were provided to local self-defense units that were under the control
of village officials. The Ngo Dinh dream of strategic hamlets was to some extent
realized under the Second Republic.
The most important aspect of rural policy was land reform legislation, which
built on prior redistribution laws that had never been fully implemented due to
wartime conditions and government weakness. In1969 and 1970, rural areas
became more secure and the legal structure of the Second Republic was able
to effectively address agrarian issues. Within three years, redistributed land
amounted to two and a half times what had been transferred during the previous
decade and a half. The maximum amount of land anyone could own was
reduced by85 percent. While owners were compensated, tenants received land
free of charge, as did landless farmers, war veterans, families of war dead, and
others. Farmers were allowed to keep land that had been redistributed by
communist authorities, and all new owners received permanent deeds, which
they were forbidden to sell during fifteen years. In some areas that had been
controlled by communists, by1968 the taxes collected by communist authorities
from those to whom they had given land exceeded the rent of tenants in adjacent
government-controlled areas. Rural taxation under the Second Republic was
comparatively light.

Cultural and intellectual life under the Second Republic was to some extent an
echo of the lively debates and diversity of views that had characterized Saigon in
the1920s and 1930s. The experience of the heavy American military presence
during the late1960s stimulated extensive discussion about negative American
influences and the importance of a Vietnamese cultural identity. As the American
presence rapidly declined in the early1970s, a southern Vietnamese perspective
on national culture focused on issues larger than the war. This was different from
North Vietnam, where thought and culture were entirely subordinated to the war
and to politics. Southerners enjoyed the freedom to speak and to write about
matters not directly related to the war or to politics. Journalism, literary works,
magazines, and academic journals reflected a wide range of interests, ideologies,
and opinions about culture, politics, religion, science, youth, gender, family
relations, international trends, and personal life. Compared with cultural life in
North Vietnam, this sometimes appeared chaotic and disconnected from the
wartime situation, but it was a typical expression of southern openness to new
ideas and to the outside world. Furthermore, it demonstrated why the war was
being fought.
The victory of Hanoi
When Ho Chi Minh died in mid1969, Le Duan decided to enshrine public
memory of him with the goal of conquering the south, thereby adding an aura of
saintliness to the party’s policies and authority. The tightening of domestic social
control became increasingly important not only to mitigate war weariness but
also to maintain discipline as it became increasingly difficult to dismiss doubts
about the Sino-Vietnamese alliance, which had been the cornerstone of victory in
the French war. China was uninterested in having a united Vietnam on its
southern border and was eager to establish a relationship with the US to give it
leverage in relations with the Soviet Union. Although China continued to voice
support for Hanoi, it slowly backed away from the war in South Vietnam and
instead strengthened its relations with the Cambodian communists who were
seeking to overthrow Lon Nol. While the Soviet Union moderated its public
support of Hanoi to facilitate relations with the US, it was willing to supply
Hanoi with whatever it needed to win the war, gambling on the chance for an
alliance with a united Vietnam on the southern border of its Chinese antagonist.
With Nixon’s diplomatic game gathering momentum, Le Duan and Le Duc
Tho worried that the time available to achieve their goal in the south was ebbing
away. By1972, there were very few American ground troops in Vietnam, but the
Second Republic was looking increasingly formidable. The Paris peace talks were

at an impasse. Nixon had conceded the right of the North Vietnamese army to
remain in South Vietnam after an agreement, but he rejected Hanoi’s precondi-
tion of dismantling the Second Republic. However, 1972 was an American
presidential election year, and public opinion in the US and internationally was
opposed to continued American involvement in Vietnam. This raised communist
hopes that Nixon would be as vulnerable to a major offensive as Johnson had
been in1968 and that he would acquiesce in a Hanoi victory.
In the spring of1972, North Vietnam mobilized virtually its entire military
potential, including strategic reserves, to launch a three-prong invasion of South
Vietnam with the goal of winning the war immediately. The South Vietnamese
army defeated this invasion with American logistical and air support. Further-
more, Nixon mined North Vietnamese harbors and initiated a new bombing
campaign against North Vietnam. His escalation of American involvement did
not damage American relations with either China or the Soviet Union. Hanoi’s
gamble had failed, and, when it became apparent that Nixon would be re-elected,
Le Duc Tho signaled to his American negotiating partner, Heinz Alfred (Henry)
Kissinger (b.1923), Nixon’s National Security Advisor, that he no longer
demanded the dismantling of the Second Republic before an agreement could
be reached.
Le Duc Tho and Kissinger had been conducting secret negotiations separate
from the official four-party peace talks, which had never developed beyond
issuing propaganda. After the defeat of Hanoi’s spring offensive of1972,L e
Duc Tho was keen for an agreement that would eliminate the US from the war
and compromise the Second Republic. The push for an agreement from the
American side came from Kissinger’s personal investment in it and from the
election of an anti-war congress in the autumn of 1972 that threatened to
legislate an end to American involvement in Vietnam when it convened in
January1973.
The agreement drafted by Kissinger and Le Duc Tho provided for the release
of American prisoners of war and the end of American military intervention. It
allowed the North Vietnamese army to remain in South Vietnam and provided
for a political process to supersede the Second Republic with a coalition govern-
ment that would include communists and neutralists. It abandoned the aim of
preserving a non-communist South Vietnam and discarded the sovereignty of the
Second Republic, which was accorded a status equal with the communist Provi-
sional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam.
There were strong public expressions of opposition to this agreement in South
Vietnam. The House of Representatives of the National Assembly rejected the
political provisions that nullified the Second Republic’s sovereignty. Nguyen Van
Thieu announced that he could not accept the agreement without changes. He

wanted to initiate direct Hanoi–Saigon negotiations, but the US, just as France
had claimed to negotiate for Saigon in1954, was determined to avoid direct
contact between the Vietnamese sides. Nguyen Van Thieu understood that he
was powerless to influence the peace talks and trusted Nixon’s assurance that
adjustments would be made and that the US would continue to support the
Second Republic regardless of any agreement made.
However, when the US proposed changes, Le Duc Tho withdrew a concession
previously made that was particularly important to the Americans: separation of
the release of American prisoners of war from the issue of releasing political
prisoners held by the Second Republic. Nixon needed this concession, for with-
out it American prisoners would remain hostage to the disposition of Vietnamese
prisoners, which was a difficult and unpredictable issue. With a newly elected
Congress that was determined to legislate the end of American involvement in
Vietnam scheduled to convene in a matter of weeks, Nixon resorted to a
bombing campaign that in a few days destroyed North Vietnam’s air defense
capability and persuaded Hanoi to restore the prisoner of war concession, which
led to the signing of an agreement in late January1973 by which the US military
presence in Vietnam was terminated within two months.
The political provisions of the Paris Agreement were never implemented, and
the war continued in South Vietnam without American participation. After the
North Vietnamese defeats in1972, the Soviet Union provided all that was
necessary to rebuild and supply communist forces in South Vietnam. An all-
weather road and a pipeline were constructed from North Vietnam through the
uplands to a point not far from Saigon, and plans were made for offensive
operations to destroy the Second Republic.
Within a year of the agreement, South Vietnam began to experience severe
economic and military problems as a result of the1973 oil embargo crisis and the
progressive reduction of US aid. The communist military build-up coincided with
American disengagement as Nixon’s political problems and eventual resignation
ended the prospect of any further US interest in Vietnamese affairs. The military
balance shifted in favor of North Vietnam as South Vietnamese forces suffered
shortages of petrol, spare parts, and ammunition. Widespread economic distress
led to Saigon street demonstrations in the autumn of1974. Nguyen Van Thieu’s
political career had been based on a trust in the American alliance. As it became
apparent that this alliance no longer existed, he was unable to think beyond it
and was paralyzed by the looming communist threat, vainly hoping that the US
would come to the rescue.
In early 1975, North Vietnamese leaders determined that the US would not
return and initiated a campaign that within two months obtained total victory.
Days later, fighting broke out between the Vietnamese and the Cambodian

communists, who had just gained control of Cambodia with Chinese support.
These hostilities were quickly halted, but they foreshadowed another war and
demonstrated that American withdrawal had enabled the Sino-Soviet confron-
tation to come alive in the region.
The Sino-Khmer War and renovation
Hanoi moved rapidly to unify the country. The Provisional Revolutionary Gov-
ernment of South Vietnam was pushed aside and administrators were sent from
the north to establish the new regime in the south. Many Second Republic officials
were killed and hundreds of thousands of people were sent to concentration
camps, ostensibly to re-educate them to live in a socialist society. A system of
registering the population was instituted to ensure that those whose families had
supported the Second Republic were penalized by denial of employment, educa-
tion, and food rations. An ambitious plan for economic development was initiated,
but within three years the country was facing political, economic, and diplomatic
failures. These failures became parts of a crisis that led to a new war.
The harsh official attitude toward the defeated population squandered a
potential reservoir of good will among many southerners who were ready to
turn their backs on the past and to contribute to building a new united country.
The Hanoi government even marginalized southern communists. Many people
from urban areas were relocated with a minimum of preparation in relatively
remote“new economic zones” in rural areas. Large numbers of these people
surreptitiously returned to the cities. Efforts to collectivize southern agriculture
were stymied by the resistance of the rural population. In the shadow of a new
war, the Hanoi leaders rushed to gain control of the south and to integrate its
resources into its militarized economy.
The strategic situation after the withdrawal of American power shifted rapidly
as China and the Soviet Union competed for influence in Southeast Asia. The
pressure point of this confrontation was the Cambodian–Vietnamese border, a
border that, while drawn by French colonial administrators in the1930s, was
very close to the border that existed prior to the French arrival in the nineteenth
century. This border was based on the Vietnamese acquisition of formerly
Cambodian territories in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. While it was
considered to be a satisfactory border by Vietnamese authorities, Cambodian
nationalists were unreconciled to the loss of the lower Mekong plain, and this
was particularly true of the Cambodian communists who gained control of
Phnom Penh in1975 under the leadership of Saloth Sar (1925–1998), also
known as Pol Pot.

Added to the sense of a historical grievance was the strong resistance of Pol Pot
to what he understood as the threat of Vietnam dominating Cambodia in the
same way that it dominated Laos. Some Cambodian communists, particularly
those in the eastern provinces along the Vietnamese border, were willing to
collaborate with the Vietnamese and even to defer to Vietnamese leadership.
Pol Pot, full of nationalist fervor and feeling surrounded by enemies, was eager to
eliminate what he viewed as colonial residue, whether French, Vietnamese, or
Cambodian. He initiated a homicidal policy against urbanites, people with
education, and the people of the eastern provinces.
By 1977, Pol Pot, with the benefit of Chinese economic and military assistance,
initiated attacks across the Vietnamese border to eliminate the Vietnamese
population in areas that Phnom Penh claimed as Cambodian. In response,
Vietnam briefly campaigned into Cambodia in late1977. Between two and three
hundred thousand Cambodians fled their country and followed the Vietnamese
withdrawal back into Vietnam where they constituted a large refugee popula-
tion. Hanoi’s efforts to negotiate a settlement of the border issue were rejected by
Phnom Penh, and it became apparent that Cambodian intransigence on the
border issue was tacitly supported by China.
The next phase of sliding into war focused on the ethnic Chinese population in
Vietnam. This population had developed differently in northern and southern
Vietnam. Southern Chinese had been forced to take Vietnamese citizenship in the
late1950s. In the north, however, the relatively smaller Chinese population had
been accorded a special status: it was allowed to retain Chinese citizenship with
its privilege of travel to China and was exempted from Vietnamese military
conscription and from certain tax liabilities. Chinese in the north were experts
in the unofficial Sino-Vietnamese cross-border trade and in the south had accu-
mulated wealth from their business skills and international contacts. By early
1978, Vietnamese authorities perceived the Chinese communities as not only
threats to their plans for a socialist economy but also a fifth column allied with
China in the armed confrontation that was rapidly materializing. When the
Vietnamese acted to confiscate the property of Chinese in the south and to force
the southern Chinese population into the socialist economy, thousands of south-
ern Chinese fled from the country by sea. At the same time, Hanoi endeavored to
restrict the Chinese population in the north, fearing their vulnerability to being
manipulated by China. When China announced that Vietnam was persecuting
the Chinese and that it was sending ships to rescue them, there was a stampede of
northern Chinese to the Sino-Vietnamese border.
By the summer of1978, the prospect of a Sino-Vietnamese war loomed over
the region as China continued to build up the Cambodian army and concentrated
troops along the Sino-Vietnamese border. The Vietnamese economy was in

shambles with confiscation of private property and the penalization of people
with wealth in the south, with the ruin of southern agriculture by the failed
collectivization effort, and with plans for industrial development in the north
stillborn by lack of investment and the return of wartime priorities.
Added to the turmoil in domestic affairs and in relations with China and
Cambodia, Vietnam fell afoul of the Cold War shift from China and the Soviet
Union against the US to China and the US against the Soviet Union. Failing in
negotiations to normalize relations with the US, Vietnam signed a strategic treaty
with the Soviet Union and made plans to strike Cambodia before China could
act, thereby initiating a war that for the next ten years kept Vietnam encircled by
enemies with a thin lifeline to the Soviet Bloc countries.
After organizing the semblance of an allied Cambodian government from
among the Khmer refugees, Vietnam invaded Cambodia at the end of1978
and within days had defeated the Cambodian army and sent Pol Pot and his
associates fleeing to the Thai border. China, having just normalized relations
with the US and eager to demonstrate its strategic value as an anti-Soviet ally,
briefly invaded Vietnamese border provinces in early1979 and then withdrew
after destroying the economic and administrative infrastructure there. There-
after, Sino-Vietnamese hostilities continued with cross-border shelling and raids
while the main arena of the war was in Cambodia, where Vietnam supervised the
establishment of a Cambodian army and government.
Contesting Vietnamese ascendancy in Cambodia were three Cambodian groups
operating from bases along the Thai border with the logistical support of the Thai
army. China provided supplies primarily to Pol Pot. The neighboring countries that
had allied with the US in the1960s, which included Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,
Indonesia, and the Philippines (the five ASEAN countries), mainly supported a
royalist group led by Sihanouk. The US gave support to a third group espousing
parliamentary democracy led by Son Sann (1911–2000), a veteran politician who
had been active in politics since the1940s. Supervised by China, the US, and the
ASEAN countries, the three groups were diplomatically organized, presented, and
acknowledged in the United Nations as the legitimate coalition government of
Cambodia, thereby preventing the government formed in Phnom Penh, supported
by Vietnam and the Soviet Bloc countries, from receiving UN recognition.
The three anti-Vietnamese Cambodian groups established bases just inside the
Cambodian border from where they launched guerrilla operations. During the
1984–1985 dry season, Vietnamese forces attacked and destroyed all of these
bases. Thereafter, Vietnam began to withdraw its army back to Vietnam,
handing responsibility for defending the country to its client government in
Cambodia, which from1985 was led by Hun Sen (b.1952), a former follower
of Pol Pot who had defected to Vietnam in1977.

The collapse of the Soviet Union removed the rationale of the war. Vietnam
accordingly completed its withdrawal from Cambodia in1989. In the early
1990s, the UN sponsored a ceasefire and elections in Cambodia, which led to a
brief coalition between the royalists and Hun Sen, yet Hun Sen and his followers
continued to dominate Cambodian politics well into the twenty-first century.
This superficially appeared to vindicate Vietnam’s war aims. However, regional
politics shifted sharply in the1990s with Vietnam joining ASEAN and making
peace with China. Furthermore, the price paid by Vietnam for this war was very
high, bringing unprecedented economic distress. It also contributed to an exodus
of people fleeing the country by sea, sojourning in regional refugee camps, and
emigrating to foreign lands.
In the early years of the Sino-Khmer War, deepening poverty forced Hanoi to
acquiesce in a new system of agriculture that restored some incentive for private
initiative with contracts for farmers to supply the state with specified amounts of
produce and allowing anything beyond that to be freely marketed for private
profit. This somewhat alleviated the food supply and led to relative well being in
the countryside. During the1980s, villagers in northern Vietnam began to invest
their private earnings in building brick homes to replace their thatched wooden
dwellings. Urban populations, however, suffered from a lack of income, a
deteriorating infrastructure, a scarcity of consumer goods, and hunger.
The death of Le Duan in the spring of1986 made possible a shift in domestic
policy. Truong Chinh presided over the party for six months during which
Nguyen Van Linh (1915–1998) rode the pressures for reform to replace him.
Nguyen Van Linh was originally from Hanoi, had joined the party in the1930s,
and spent several years in French prisons. In1975, he became the leader of the
party in the south where he had been assigned since the early1960s. By the mid
1980s, he was known to be at odds with Le Duan over economic and cultural
policy. He favored a loosening of state control over markets, religious and
cultural activities, and journalism. During his years as head of the party, from
late1986 to mid 1991, he nurtured a younger generation of party leaders and
initiated what became known as thedoi moipolicy, literally “to change to the
new,” commonly rendered in English as“renovation.” As the Sino-Khmer War
ended and the Soviet Bloc disappeared, he restored trade with China and encour-
aged foreign investment from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and other
countries. He invited journalists to report on corruption and abuse, allowed
publication of literary works critical of party policies, and encouraged the
restoration of temples and local festivals.
One aspect of the renovation policy was an effort to create a sense of continu-
ity with pre-revolutionary culture by cultivating new versions of traditional art,
music, theater, village festivals, and religious pilgrimage sites. The rebuilding and

repair of temples became possible with contributions from a rising class of
businesswomen who worked in the urban markets. Many temples in northern
Vietnam had been neglected and not a few were even plundered and destroyed by
greedy or fanatical officials. Perhaps the most notorious example is the many
lavishly furnished temples on Mount Yen Tu, around125 kilometers east of
Hanoi, which dated to the Tran dynasty and were a major pilgrimage destination
for centuries. By the time of the renovation policy, they had all been stripped of
valuables and burned down under the supervision of local officials. In the early
1990s, a monk returned to the mountain and, with government approbation,
began to rebuild one of the temples with contributions of pilgrims. Within a few
years, the government had built a new road to the foot of the mountain and a
welcoming center for the growing number of pilgrims.
At the party congress in1991, Nguyen Van Linh stepped down, ostensibly
because of poor health, and was replaced by Do Muoi (b.1917). Do Muoi was
born near Hanoi, had joined the party in his youth, and had made his career in
the state bureaucracy. During his six years at the head of the party, thedoi moi
policy was basically preserved. At the same time, there was a stronger emphasis
upon internal security measures to affirm the party’s control over public opinion
and political activity. In1997, Do Muoi was succeeded by his protégé Le Kha
Phieu (b.1931). Le Kha Phieu had made his career in the military and was critical
of corruption and factionalism in the party. However, his anti-corruption cam-
paigns united virtually all the party factions against him, and, in2001, he was
forced to retire. Nong Duc Manh (b.1940), a forestry expert from the mountains
north of Hanoi rumored to be a son of Ho Chi Minh, replaced him and remained
head of the party for ten years with a policy of economic development and strong
party control modeled on the example of China.
One of Le Kha Phieu’s unpopular acts was completing a treaty with China that
demarcated the land border and the Gulf of Tonkin sea border. Many Vietnamese
considered that this treaty conceded too much to China and represented a proffering
of homage to the big northern neighbor. However, with communist parties losing
power in many countries during the1990s, the Chinese and Vietnamese parties
gradually built a new version of the close relationship that had existed between the
two countries for centuries. But new conditions in the twenty-first century placed
limits on this relationship and created a contradiction for party leaders.
On the one hand, by the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Vietnam-
ese ruling party’s ability to maintain power depended upon the continued success
of the Chinese ruling party to control China. Any political change in China that
displaced the Chinese party would have made it very difficult for the Vietnamese
party to avoid political change as well. A close and mutually supportive relation-
ship between the two parties helped to sustain the regime in Vietnam.

On the other hand, the rise of popular nationalism in both countries exacer-
bated the underlying tension in the relationship between a China seeking regional
dominance and a Vietnam determined to resist subordination. This tension was
concretely expressed in the growing dispute over the islands in the South China
Sea. The Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago had been inherited from France and
occupied by South Vietnam until it was seized by China in1974. The Truong Sa
(Spratley) archipelago was claimed and partly occupied by China but parts of it
were also claimed and occupied by Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries.
Hanoi appeared to acknowledge Chinese sovereignty over the islands in the late
1950s when it was dependent upon China for its policy of taking over the south,
but from1975 the Vietnamese government forcefully announced its claim to the
islands.
After the Sino-Khmer War, Vietnamese foreign policy experts debated whether
to follow China and to prosper as a junior regional partner in what was imagined
as an inevitable Chinese hegemony over eastern and southeastern Asia, or
whether to follow a multi-directional policy aimed to maximize anti-Chinese
leverage in cooperation with the ASEAN countries, Japan, and the US. This
debate continued into the twenty-first century, fueled by the island dispute and
the fear that China would eventually enforce its claims unless the US remained a
balancing presence in the region. At the beginning of the twenty-first century,
having weathered the storms of French colonialism, the Japanese Empire, and
both phases of the Cold War, the Vietnamese faced the prospect of returning to a
Sinic world order, unsure about how feasible for the long term a multi-lateral
foreign policy option might be. In general, northerners view such a prospect with
less dismay than do southerners.

RETROSPECTIVE
Considering the events discussed in this book, no conclusion can be drawn in the
sense of discovering some deep logic governing a presumed destiny of the
Vietnamese people. Knowledge of the Vietnamese past in the English language
accumulated in the late twentieth century in the shadow of war; academics,
journalists, and politicians accorded the chief privilege of shaping that accumu-
lation to the group of Vietnamese fortunate enough to have allies that remained
relatively steadfast until the last battle. What accumulated came from wartime
propaganda based on a stridently nationalistic version of Vietnamese history that
featured, first, an affirmation of Vietnamese identity pre-dating contact with the
ancient Chinese and, second, dominant themes of rebellion against colonial
oppression and resistance to foreign aggression; neither of these ideas can be
sustained by a study of existing evidence about the past.
More appropriate than a conclusion is a retrospective in the sense of a
reappraisal that keeps close to surviving materials from the past and that aims
to see the Vietnamese and their ancestors through their own eyes in various times
and places. To some extent, what we see is“just one random thing after
another”; but this in itself is important because it alerts us to the fallacy of
putting faith in a rigid overarching narrative of“the Vietnamese people” or
“the Vietnamese nation.” There is no discernible pattern to explain how times
of prosperity and well being alternated with times of misery and violence. As this
book demonstrates, the Vietnamese past is, among other things, a great swath of
failed experiments in social organization and governance.
It is instructive to realize that an event trumpeted by Vietnamese historians as
a great moment of glory– defeat of the Mongol invasions in the thirteenth
century – was followed by nearly a decade of famine and starvation leading to
the enslavement of a large part of the rural population by the warriors who had
fought off the Mongols. Similarly, victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu was
followed by a homicidal cauterization of the northern rural population into the
discipline of obedience to state authority. On the other hand, the French

conquest of northern Vietnam ended decades of lawlessness during which the
Vietnamese government was powerless to stop women and children from being
routinely kidnapped for sale as slaves in China. A serious consideration of what
happened in the past makes it difficult to sustain the visions of heroes and villains
favored by those who write about the past in service to state authority.
The retrospective that emerges from the narrative constructed in this book
shows three main reconsiderations. These reconsiderations are about the Viet-
namese relationship with China, about the relationship between northern and
southern Vietnamese, and about the relationship of the Vietnamese with the non-
Chinese world.
It is clear that who and what we call Vietnamese did not exist prior to the
centuries during which Vietnamese ancestors lived as inhabitants of Chinese
dynastic empires. Every aspect of Vietnamese culture appeared as a result of
being in that empire and from the existence of a large Chinese-speaking popula-
tion that developed over several generations and that eventually melted into the
local population when the imperial connection was severed. Vietnamese lan-
guage, literature, education, religion, historiography, philosophy, family system,
social and political organization, cuisine, medicine, music, and art: all are deeply
imprinted with the marks of what is commonly called East Asian or Sinitic
civilization. This occurred differently from the other peripheral members of this
civilization: the Japanese and the Koreans.
Relative isolation on islands off the continent enabled a process of picking
and choosing that allowed Japanese rulers to keep China at arm’s-length. On
the other hand, Koreans absorbed Sinitic influence in a particularly thorough,
albeit idiosyncratic way that achieved a countenance of cultural and political
legitimacy enabling survival on a peninsula of pressure between Chinese, Jap-
anese, and various powers inhabiting Manchuria. Vietnamese grew from within
the Sinitic imperial world, as the ancient Koreans also initially did; but while
Korean kingdoms began an autonomous existence after the fall of the Han
dynasty, a similar Vietnamese event did not occur until after the fall of the Tang
dynasty.
The Vietnamese did not live on islands or on a peninsula where the power of
Chinese dynasties could be either ignored or balanced with other Sinicizing
powers. They came from a place where Chinese speakers, during the course of a
millennium, were constantly reinforced by immigration from the northern empire;
these people were eventually cut off from the north and gradually faded into the
local population through a process of mutual absorption that produced what we
call Vietnamese. For centuries, this was a strategically and economically important
jurisdiction of successive Chinese empires; for centuries thereafter, local rulers
posed as vassals of Chinese dynasties. No powers or civilizations other than China

have seriously competed for the attention of people living here with the brief
exceptions of France, Japan, the USSR, and the US in modern times.
After the tumults of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a fundamental
long-term pattern in Vietnamese historical experience of being ineluctably con-
nected to the Chinese political world has re-emerged. For example, it is difficult
to imagine any significant political change in Vietnam without a prior change in
China. For one thing, the Vietnamese cannot avoid living as a neighbor of China,
and they understand that they must show to China a visage that does not
contradict Chinese interests and that is congruent with Chinese political practice.
Any effort to change the Vietnamese political system without Chinese precedent
would be likely to create opportunities for Chinese involvement in domestic
affairs that could compromise the measure of independence currently exercised.
Vietnamese autonomy with regard to China, now as in the past, remains depend-
ent upon a successful practice of mimicry.
At the same time, the temptation to pull away from the Chinese model remains
alive among the Vietnamese, particularly southerners. However, potential balan-
cing options involving non-Chinese Asian neighbors and possibly the US are
fraught with uncertainty and doubt. It is easier for most Vietnamese leaders to
trust the Chinese than to trust non-Chinese neighbors and allies because they
know and understand the Chinese to a much greater degree than they know and
understand any other people. Although they have no doubt that a strong China
will never lose a chance to squeeze them, they also know that for many gener-
ations with few exceptions Vietnamese leaders have successfully maintained
acceptable relationships with Chinese governments. Vietnamese are culturally
familiar, even intimate, with the Chinese. The historic relationship, involving
mixtures of subservience and non-compliance, has existed through the vicissi-
tudes of centuries of experience.
The nationalistic conceit of being in a constant state of aggravation with the
Chinese has no basis in fact. For centuries, during the first millennium of the
Common Era, ancestors of the Vietnamese lived in relative peace and security as
residents of the Sinitic empire. Subsequently, Chinese military operations were
launched against Vietnamese rulers only five times, and each of these times
resulted from unusual circumstances. In the930s, the Southern Han campaigned
in northern Vietnam amidst the post-Tang competition among regional powers.
In980, the rising Northern Song dynasty followed the pattern of previous
dynasties in viewing northern Vietnam as an integral part of the empire, albeit
after this pattern was no longer feasible; in1075, border problems became
entangled in Song bureaucratic factionalism, emboldening a Vietnamese attack
into southern China that provoked a counterattack; in1407, the ascendant Ming
dynasty endeavored to take advantage of dynastic change among the Vietnamese

to restore the Han-Tang imperial borders but soon discovered that this was not a
realistic policy; in1979, China attacked Vietnam to prevent Soviet influence
from stabilizing in Vietnam and Cambodia after American withdrawal from the
region. In each case, Chinese interest in attacking Vietnam arose from specific
and contingent circumstances, and it quickly evaporated once those circum-
stances had changed.
On the other hand, refugee Song Chinese armies were allied with the Vietnam-
ese during the Mongol Wars of the thirteenth century. In the eighteenth century,
Qing China sent an expedition to support its vassal, the Le dynasty king, against
rebels, but had no ambition to take over the country. In the1880s, China, at
great cost and with little prospect of success, honored its obligations to the
Vietnamese court by attempting to prevent the French conquest of northern
Vietnam. In the early1950s, China served as the ally of an aspiring Vietnamese
protégé. With few and very episodic exceptions, Vietnamese and Chinese have
lived in peace and amity.
The controversy over the islands in the South China Sea is more of a regional
than a purely Sino-Vietnamese issue. It arises because the future direction of
international relations in the region remains in question and the islands have
become symbolic of that uncertainty. Should a relatively stable and widely
shared understanding of regional security be achieved, there is unlikely to be
any insurmountable impediment to working out acceptable accommodations
among the disputants and other interested powers. An obstacle to Chinese and
Vietnamese governments making such accommodations is the nationalistic
enthusiasms with which they have educated their peoples.
The second reconsideration warns against the conceit of a unified Vietnamese
people. Any effort to describe the Vietnamese must be alert to the many regional
differences among them. For example, even among northerners, people from
Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ha Tinh sometimes express disdain toward those
who live in the Red River plain, considering them as passive and susceptible to
Chinese blandishments. On the other hand, people of the Red River plain resent
what they view as the arrogance and pushiness of people from the three coastal
provinces immediately to their south, the birthplaces of Le kings, Trinh lords,
and of many cadres of the communist party who flooded into Hanoi to occupy
positions of authority after1954. This is a difficult inter-regional relationship
that goes back to the wars between the Mac and Le dynasties in the sixteenth
century and to the generations of Trinh misgovernment in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries.
Elsewhere, one cannot ignore Hue’s proud heritage of presiding over the
centuries-long process of Vietnamese becoming southerners as well as bringing
into existence the country of Vietnam as it now exists with its modern borders.

This pride is susceptible to a desire to speak on behalf of the entire country with
an air of moral authority, a tendency that remains strong among Buddhist
leaders based in Hue. In contrast, the people of the Da Nang region, with a
mixed Cham–Viet heritage, a milder climate, and a good harbor, are less inter-
ested in virtue from the past and more interested in wealth from maritime trade.
Further south, the regions between Da Nang and Saigon where the bitter battles
of the1790s and the early 1800s were fought retain distinctive provincial
outlooks that in various ways seek to minimize connections with the larger
Vietnamese realm, echoes of Nguyen Nhac’s Tay Son perspective.
Above all these differences is the contrast between north and south epitomized
by the cities of Hanoi and Saigon. The large stereotypes of northern and southern
Vietnamese mask many regional differences, but nevertheless reflect a fundamen-
tal divergence among Vietnamese. Northerners are more disciplined to accept
and to exercise government authority, they are proud of inhabiting what they
view as the center of Vietnamese culture, they tend to be cautious about contact
with the overseas world, and they are inclined to view what is happening in
China as a model. Southerners are more individualistic, egalitarian, entrepre-
neurial, interested in wealth more than in authority, proud of carrying within
themselves their own sense of culture, open to the outside world, and wary of
how things are done in China. Northerners, more than southerners, see virtue in
poverty, a legacy from three centuries of misgovernment under Vietnamese
regimes from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. Southerners, more than
northerners, see virtue in having options and possibilities to explore, a legacy
from the frontier experience and the relatively light touch of Nguyen govern-
ment. The generally ineffective Nguyen government in the mid nineteenth cen-
tury posed few problems for southerners, many of whom by the1860s were
being governed by the French; but for northerners, after having been inured to
the discipline of Confucian administrators and to the authoritarianism of the
Trinh regime in Hanoi, the lack of a functioning government produced political,
social, and economic chaos that was finally brought to an end by the French. Any
discussion of the Vietnamese cannot avoid the ambiguities created by northern
and southern viewpoints. These ambiguities can be viewed either as a problem or
as an asset, as creating tensions that lead to frustration or to opportunities for
mutual benefit.
The emergence of a southern Vietnamese perspective was much more complex
than the cliché of“southern advance” (nam tien) implies. There was no single
historical process impelling Vietnamese southward. The movement of Vietnam-
ese into the south was fundamentally episodic, reflecting a variety of different
causes and motivations depending upon time and place, over a period of several
centuries and from region to region over great distances. Furthermore, this was

not a purely Vietnamese phenomenon. Chams, Chinese, Khmers, as well as
upland peoples of the Central Highlands all participated significantly in this long
historical process, often contributing a willingness to accept the ascendancy of
Hue in exchange for peace and security. Many of the actual battles were between
Chams serving the Vietnamese and Chams resisting the Vietnamese, or between
Chinese and Khmers, or between Khmers allied with the Vietnamese and Khmers
allied with the Siamese. Southerners entered multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-
lingual realms open to the outside world as was not possible in the north. This
was reinforced by two and a half centuries of political separation and military
confrontation between two rival versions of being Vietnamese, and the legacy of
this is still alive.
Finally, the idea that the Vietnamese have preserved an ancient, or at least a
pre-modern, identity through the vicissitudes of the modern age must be recon-
sidered. During the last century and a half, the Vietnamese have experienced an
intense engagement with Europe, not only France, but also, from the1920s
through the 1980s, with the Soviet Union and other Soviet Bloc countries, not
to mention the brief American involvement in the south during the1950s, 1960s,
and early1970s. At the same time, the cultural connection with China based on
an educational system in Literary Chinese came to an end. Ideas about society,
politics, government, education, scholarship, literature, art, and music have all
been transformed by ideologies and practices coming from Europe, whether the
capitalist and democratic“west” or the communist and totalitarian“east.” In the
1950s and1960s, the Maoist version of the East European form of moderniza-
tion was added to the mix of revolutionary thought and action. In the1990s and
2000s, the Deng Xiaoping version of market economics inspired efforts to
renovate the relationship between government and the production of wealth.
The idea of attributing economic success to a Confucian past gained some
attention in the late1980s and early1990s but quickly faded away.
The search for the“real” Vietnam or for the“cultural core” of being Viet-
namese is bound to fail. There is an accumulation of different religious, ideo-
logical, and cultural orientations among people who speak Vietnamese. Any
effort to privilege one over the others simply produces arguments without
resolution. Being Vietnamese has many forms. The only unifying characteristic
is a use of the Vietnamese language and a connection to a particular place on the
planet. What makes this place distinctive is its location between what we com-
monly categorize as East Asia and Southeast Asia: on the one hand, the Sinitic
world of Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism, popular Daoist spirit cults, and
imperial administrative procedures of which Vietnamese are unambiguous
members; and, on the other hand, the realms of entourage politics, Cham
Hinduism, Indo-Malay Islam, Theravada Buddhism, overseas Chinese and South

Asian communities, and Catholic Philippines, with which Vietnamese, especially
southerners, have some degree of familiarity and a sense of neighborhood.
Christianity, the new religions of Cao Dai and Hoa Hao, Marxism-Leninism,
and Maoism must also be included in any effort to describe the Vietnamese.
Being Vietnamese offers many options.
An enduring feature of Vietnamese experience is the fundamentally compliant
relationship with China enforced by governments modeled on what exists in
China. An aspect of this is that government tends to be didactic with weak
connections to popular aspirations. Since the fifteenth century, and continuing
to the present time, governments in Hanoi have endeavored to promote particu-
lar ideals and practices by enforcing habits of obedience, whether to be good
Confucians, vanguard socialists, or patriotic producers of wealth for the state.
Despite lofty intentions, the undercurrent of corruption, injustice, and oppres-
sion remains. Nevertheless, there are countercurrents of thought that flow else-
where than to China or to the past and that continue to be refreshed by the
Vietnamese diaspora. Although subordinated and harnessed by an authoritarian
regime, and although wounded by a faithless ally in1975, these countercurrents
nevertheless remain alive in dreams of Vietnamese futures.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC ESSAY
Materials in Asian languages
Much of this book is based upon materials written in Literary Chinese (Han) and, to a
lesser extent, in Literary Vietnamese (Nom). For readers who wish to consult these
materials, I can do no better than to refer them to Tran Van Giap,Tim Hieu Kho Sach
Han Nom(Investigation into the Storehouse of Han and Nom Books),2 vols. (Hanoi:
Van Hoa,1984–1990). That bibliography is built upon the earlier work of Émile
Gaspardone, “ Bibliographie Annamite,” Bulletin de l’École Française d’Extrême-Orient
34 (1934), which had been preceded by the pioneering work of Léopold Michel Cadière
and Paul Pelliot,“ Première Étude sur les Sources Annamites de l’Histoire d’Annam,”
Bulletin de l’École Française d’Extrême-Orient 4 (1904). A good reference for materials
held at the Institute of Han-Nom Studies in Hanoi and in various collections in Paris is
Tran Nghia and François Gros,Di San Han Nom Viet Nam Thu Muc De Yeu (Catalogue
des Livres en Han Nom), 3 vols. (Hanoi: Nha Xuat Ban Khoa Hoc Xa Hoi,1993). For
the pre-tenth-century period, see Tran Nghia,Suu Tam Va Khao Luan Tac Pham Chu
Han Cua Nguoi Viet Nam Truoc The Ky X(Search and Analysis of Works in Han
Written by Vietnamese Before the Tenth Century) (Hanoi: Nha Xuat Ban The Gioi,
2000). For inscriptions, see Nguyen Quang Hong, ed.-in-chief,Van Khac Han Nom Viet
Nam (Han and Nom Inscriptions in Vietnam) (Hanoi: Nha Xuat Ban Khoa Hoc Xa Hoi,
1992). A good reference for examination graduates through the centuries is Ngo Duc
Tho, ed.,Cac Nha Khoa Bang Viet Nam1075–1919 (Vietnamese Examination
Graduates 1075–1919) (Hanoi: Nha Xuat Ban Van Hoc,1993).
Textual information for events before the tenth century is virtually all found in the
dynastic histories and related writings from China; for these works, see Keith Weller
Taylor,The Birth of Vietnam(Berkeley: University of California Press,1983). Works
with information about the era of historiographic transition from texts based on Chinese
materials to texts based on Vietnamese materials are discussed in K. W. Taylor,“ The
‘Twelve Lords’ in Tenth-Century Vietnam,” Journal of Southeast Asian Studies14, 1
(March 1983):46–62. For studies of Chinese texts related to events in Vietnam since the
tenth century, see Yamamoto Tatsuro, ed.,Betonamu Chugoku Kankeishi(History of
Sino-Vietnamese Relations) (Tokyo: Yamakawa Shupansha,1975). A good study of the
Mongol Wars in the thirteenth century based on Chinese and Vietnamese texts is Ha Van
Tan and Pham Thi Tam,Cuoc Khang Chien Xam Luoc Nguyen Mong The Ky XIII
(Resistance to the Yuan–Mongol Invasions in the Thirteenth Century) (Hanoi: Khoa Hoc

Han and Nom texts written by Vietnamese with information about people and events
in the past form a large archive that also includes much about literature, religion,
government, geography, economics, law, philosophy, military affairs, medicine, and
education. The best catalogue of this archive is Tran Nghia and François Gros,Di San
Han Nom Viet Nam Thu Muc De Yeu, cited above. Here I will briefly mention the main
sources that I have consulted for this book. All of these works were written in Literary
Chinese (Han) unless otherwise noted; most are available today in Vietnamese
translations or, in the case of Nom texts, alphabetic transcriptions.
One of the earliest surviving annals is theViet Su Luoc(Historical Annals of Viet),
which covers the Ly dynasty (eleventh and twelfth centuries) with some materials mostly
taken from Chinese sources for earlier times, written without attribution in the thirteenth
or the fourteenth century. TheAn Nam Chi Luoc(Annals of Annam) was written in the
fourteenth century by a Vietnamese exile in China and is largely based on Chinese
sources. In the fifteenth century, a collation of historical materials resulted in theDai Viet
Su Ky Toan Thu(Complete Book of the Historical Records of Great Viet). This annal
begins in ancient times and ends with the founding of the Le dynasty in1427. It became
the basis of later historical studies that continued the annal to1675, which was
xylographically printed in1697; this printing is the Chinh Hoa edition of the work that
has survived to the present time and which preserves a Hanoi perspective. By this time
northern and southern historians were separately compiling the histories of their
respective realms, and existing historical materials for the eighteenth century mostly
reflect the work of Nguyen dynasty scholars in the nineteenth century.
An exception to this is what has been assembled by French and Vietnamese scholars
and recently translated from Han into Vietnamese with the title ofDai Viet Su Ky Tuc
Bien – 1676–1789) (Continued Compilation of the Historical Records of Great Viet–
1676–1789), being the combination of two texts held by the Institute of Han-Nom
Studies in Hanoi:Ban Ky Tuc Bien(Continued Compilation of the Basic Records), which
was produced by Trinh historians in Hanoi in the1740s covering the years1676–1740,
and Hau Le Thi Su Ky Luoc(Record of Events of the Later Le Dynasty), apparently
produced by historians in Hanoi in the1790s during Tay Son rule, which covered the
final years of the Le dynasty from1741 to 1789. For this, see Ngo The Long and Nguyen
Kim Hung, trans.,Dai Viet Su Ky Tuc Bien– 1676–1789 (Hanoi: Nha Xuat Ban Van
Hoa – Thong Tin,2011); first edition was published in1991.
In the nineteenth century, three principal works of history were produced at the
Vietnamese court. TheDai Nam Thuc Luc(True Records of the Great South) begins in
1558 when the Nguyen family established a separate base of power in the southern
Vietnamese territories and ends in1888 amidst the French conquest. It was compiled over
a period of decades and achieved its final form in1909. TheDai Nam Liet Truyen
(Biographies of the Great South), compiled along with theDai Nam Thuc Luc, contains
biographies of kings, princes, princesses, prominent officials, rebels, and other
personalities. TheKham Dinh Viet Su Thong Giam Cuong Muc(Imperially Ordered
Completely Researched General Survey of Viet History) begins in earliest antiquity and
stops with1789 when the Le dynasty ended. It was compiled over a thirty-year period
and completed in1881 and is an erudite collation of all available information from
Chinese and Vietnamese texts.
There are some texts that provide additional information about particular times and
places. For example,Lam Son Thuc Luc(True Records of Lam Son), completed in1431,
is a detailed account of Le Loi’s career fighting with Ming armies and establishing the Le

dynasty. In the early eighteenth century, Nguyen Khoa Chiem wrote what is now
known asViet Nam Khai Quoc Chi Truyen(Stories about the Founding of the Country
of Viet Nam), an anecdotal history of southern affairs from the mid sixteenth century
to the early eighteenth century.
Two texts are often categorized together as containing folklore or popular tales, though
they are very different.Viet Dien U Linh Tap(Departed Spirits of the Vietnamese Realm)
was compiled in the early fourteenth century and contains information about deified
beings from twenty-seven cults, mostly dating from the Ly dynasty, that were recognized
by the Tran dynasty as“ kingdom protecting spirits.” These include spirits of historical
figures, earth spirits, mountain spirits, and water spirits.Linh Nam Chich Quai(Strange
Tales Collected South of the Mountains) is an accumulation of tales said to have been
collected from villagers that assumed its present form in the late fifteenth century under
the sanitizing and editorializing brushes of Confucianist scholars; many of its stories were
added to historical annals to give substance to ancient times for which information did
not exist. Each of these works, in its own way, provides information about religion and
politics during the Ly, Tran, and early Le dynasties.
In the sixteenth century, Nguyen Du’s Truyen Ky Man Luc(Record of Strange Tales)
appeared, influenced by a trend in Ming China toward writing stories in which ghosts,
demons, and deities establish contact with human beings. Doan Thi Diem, a woman
famed as both a poet and a writer of prose, wrote a work in this genre calledTruyen Ky
Tan Pha(New Collection of Marvelous Stories). These works reveal educated people’s
reaction to popular forms of religious practice. Both of these authors were from the
region surrounding Hanoi.
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, three collections of stories and
anecdotes appeared that include much information about academic examinations, life
in officialdom, the culture of educated people, sightseeing, curious legends, temples
and shrines. Cong Du Tiep Ky(Writings at Leisure) by Vu Phuong De (b.1698, active
from 1730s) is full of lore current among the Vu family who came from near modern
Hai Duong and were prominent in government. Pham Dinh Ho, from near Hanoi,
wroteVu Trung Tuy But(Going with the Writing Brush through the Rain) and, with
Nguyen An, his literary accomplice,Tang Thuong Ngau Luc(Records of Chance
Vicissitudes).
A source for how Zen masters in the Tran dynasty constructed a spiritual genealogy to
connect themselves with what they believed to be the true source for the transmission of
enlightenment is theThien Uyen Tap Anh(Compiled Extracts About Zen Worthies),
compiled in the Tran dynasty. TheCo Chau Phap Van Phat Bon Hanh Ngu Luc(Record
of What has been Said about the Origin and Deeds of the Cloud Dharma Buddha at
Co Chau), written in both Han and Nom, is an accumulation of accounts about the
female Buddha worshipped at Chua Dau (Mulberry Temple) east of Hanoi, considered to
be the first Buddha to appear among the Vietnamese, in the early third century; it was
published in its present form in the mid eighteenth century.
There are many collections of poetry in both Han and Nom from the fifteenth to
twentieth centuries, but works to be performed on stage are rare. The most interesting
exception is theSai Vai(Monk and Nun), written in Nom by Nguyen Cu Trinh, a
southerner with a distinguished career as both an administrator and a literary figure. For
general introductions to works of literature, see Maurice M. Durand and Nguyen Tran
Huan,An Introduction to Vietnamese Literature(New York: Columbia University Press,
